History[edit]
The earliest corporate lineage for Cooper Tire was the M and M Manufacturing Company, founded in 1914 in Akron, Ohio by John F. Schaefer and Claude E. Hart, who were related by marriage. Their new company produced tire patches, tire cement and tire repair kits. They purchased The Giant Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, a tire rebuilding business, in 1920, and in 1922 moved the business to Findlay, Ohio,[2] at a site at the intersection of Lima and Western avenues that is still occupied by Cooper Tire, adjacent to The Cooper Corporation facility. The Cooper name originates from 1919 when Cincinnati auto-parts dealer I. J. Cooper formed The Cooper Corporation in Findlay, to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the Master Tire and Rubber Company. The company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company in 1946.[3]
The Cooper oval trademark with the Cooper Knight headgear was first registered and used in 1941. In those early years of the brand's identification, the logo also included a banner proclaiming the tires' "armored-cord" construction. The company's red, white, and blue logo would become one of the most easily recognized emblems in the tire industry.
During World War II the company, known as Master Tire and Rubber, manufactured pontoons, landing boats, waterproof bags and camouflage items, inflatable barges, life jackets and tank decoys, as well as tires, to supply the Allied forces. The U.S. government recognized the company's contribution to the war effort in a 1945 ceremony bestowing the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award (for excellence). Soon after the war (1946) the company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company.
From 1946 to 1982, Cooper Tire was headed by a member of the Brewer family: first W.B. Brewer, then his sons, Wayne and Edward. Another son, Robert, was a vice president. W.B. Brewer took Cooper Tire public, and on July 11, 1960, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the callsign "CTB," the callsign's "B" standing for "Brewer." Throughout their tenure, the Brewers set a tone for hands-on leadership, management mingling with workers, and taking care of them. They built the trust and loyalty of the workers.[4]
Under the Brewers' leadership, Cooper Tire grew significantly. By 1983, the company joined the ranks of Fortune 500 companies as one of the largest industrial companies in the United States.[5]
In 1997, Cooper purchased Avon Tyres Ltd, based in Melksham, England.
The company's largest growth acquisition occurred in 1999 when it bought The Standard Products Company, which increased Cooper's total workforce by 10,000 employees. Dearborn, Mich.-based Standard Products produced sealing, plastic trim and vibration-control systems for the automotive original-equipment industry worldwide. The purchase included Standard Products subsidiaries Oliver Rubber Company and Holm Industries Inc. Oliver Rubber manufactured tread rubber and equipment for the truck-retread industry. Holm produced seals for home and commercial refrigerators.[6]
In December, 2003, Cooper agreed to a joint venture with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, to construct a tire-manufacturing plant near Shanghai.
In January, 2005, Cooper agreed to purchase 11% of South Korea-based Kumho Tires Company, and also announced the formation of a new commercial division encompassing both Oliver Rubber Company and commercial tires.
In October, 2005, Cooper announced an agreement to obtain 51% ownership in China’s third largest tire manufacturer, Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Passenger Tire Company Ltd., and Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Truck Tire Company Ltd., to produce truck and passenger car tires for mainland Chinese and export markets.[7] Two of the businesses of the joint venture are Cooper Chengshan Passenger Tire, and Cooper Chengshan Tire.[8] In 2007 Cooper set up a manufacturing venture in eastern China with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, a company based in Taiwan. Cooper generates 25% of its global sales in China.[7] In 2007 Cooper sold its Oliver Rubber Company subsidiary, which produced tread rubber and retreading equipment, to Michelin for $69 million.[9][10]
At the end of 2011, Cooper bought Serbian tire company Trayal from Kruševac. Cooper took over a unit of Trayal Korporacija AD from Bulgarian company Brikel EAD for $13 million and invest as much as $50 million.
On June 12, 2013, a deal was finalized in which Apollo Tyres of India would buy Cooper for $2.5 billion. This move would have made Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. the only major U.S. tire manufacturer. Cooper is the second largest U.S.-based tire company, after Goodyear.[11] On December 30, 2013 Apollo pulled out of the deal since Cooper has not disclosed vital information about its lack of control over its Chinese business. The Chinese plant went on an indefinite strike against the proposed acquisition forcing Apollo to try to lower the $35-per-share bid in the original deal.[12]
Tire brands[edit]
Cooper Tires[edit]
Cooper Tires produces Cooper branded tires for passenger cars, light trucks, sport utility vehicles and commercial trucks.[13]




Avon Tyres Logo


Avon Rubber PLC[edit]
In 1997, the tire business of Avon Rubber PLC of Melksham, Wiltshire, in the United Kingdom was sold to Cooper. This left Avon able to concentrate on its core businesses of automotive components, technical products, and protective equipment. Cooper Tire remains a major employer in central Melksham.
Other brands[edit]
In addition to Avon, Cooper Tire manufactures tires under the associated brand names Dean, Mastercraft, Mickey Thompson, Roadmaster, and Starfire.[14] Cooper Tire formerly manufactured all tires sold under the Sears Guardsman brand at Sears, Roebuck & Co. stores. Cooper manufactures tires for Discount Tire Company under the Arizonian brand name, and Futura Tires for Pep Boys. Cooper Tire also manufactures Hercules branded tires in Findlay, Ohio. Cooper tires can be purchased at many tire retailers, like Tire Discounters, Pep Boys, Discount Tire, and more.
Motorsports and sponsorships[edit]




Cooper racing tires (A1GP)


Avon, then part of Avon Rubber PLC, was involved in Formula One in the 1950s (1954 and from 1956 to 1959), then in 1981 and 1982.
Cooper became the official tire of the A1 Grand Prix, dubbed the World Cup of Motorsports, for the series' initial 2005-2006 season and was under contract to produce slick tires and treaded rain tires for the series championship until 2008.
Since 1982, Avon Tyres had been the sole supplier for the British Formula Three Championship. From the 2009 season onwards, these were re-branded "Cooper" as Cooper became the championship's official title sponsor, and will be until the end of the 2014 season at least.[15] Avon Tyres was also the exclusive supplier for the FIA Formula Two Championship when revived in 2009 to 2012.[16]
In April, 2010, Cooper/Avon Tyres presented a written proposal to Formula One Team Association (FOTA) to be the official tire supplier for the 2011 Formula One season.[17] This was ultimately rejected and Pirelli became the official tire supplier for 2011 onwards.
In the United States, Cooper became the official tire of the Champ Car Atlantic Championship in 2007. Cooper became the official tire of the IMSA Prototype Lites series (formerly IMSA Lites) in 2010.[18] Cooper Tires is the official supplier of the Mazda Road to Indy formula ladder: USF2000 (since 2010), Pro Mazda (since 2013) and Indy Lights (since 2014).
As of 2014, Cooper is the official supplier of the FIA World Rallycross Championship.[19]
On the 7th of July 2017, it was announced that Avon Tyres would be the primary kit sponsor for Championship side Derby County for the 2017/2018 season.
Management and company personnel[edit]
Cooper has 10,540 employees as of its 2016 annual report. Bradley E. Hughes is Cooper's President, and CEO.[20]

The company's red, white, and blue logo would become one of the most easily recognized emblems in the tire industry.
During World War II the company, known as Master Tire and Rubber, manufactured pontoons, landing boats, waterproof bags and camouflage items, inflatable barges, life jackets and tank decoys, as well as tires, to supply the Allied forces. The U.S. government recognized the company's contribution to the war effort in a 1945 ceremony bestowing the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award (for excellence). Soon after the war (1946) the company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company.
From 1946 to 1982, Cooper Tire was headed by a member of the Brewer family: first W.B. Brewer, then his sons, Wayne and Edward. Another son, Robert, was a vice president. W.B. Brewer took Cooper Tire public, and on July 11, 1960, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the callsign "CTB," the callsign's "B" standing for "Brewer." Throughout their tenure, the Brewers set a tone for hands-on leadership, management mingling with workers, and taking care of them. They built the trust and loyalty of the workers.[4]
Under the Brewers' leadership, Cooper Tire grew significantly. By 1983, the company joined the ranks of Fortune 500 companies as one of the largest industrial companies in the United States.[5]
In 1997, Cooper purchased Avon Tyres Ltd, based in Melksham, England.
The company's largest growth acquisition occurred in 1999 when it bought The Standard Products Company, which increased Cooper's total workforce by 10,000 employees. Dearborn, Mich.-based Standard Products produced sealing, plastic trim and vibration-control systems for the automotive original-equipment industry worldwide. The purchase included Standard Products subsidiaries Oliver Rubber Company and Holm Industries Inc. Oliver Rubber manufactured tread rubber and equipment for the truck-retread industry. Holm produced seals for home and commercial refrigerators.[6]
In December, 2003, Cooper agreed to a joint venture with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, to construct a tire-manufacturing plant near Shanghai.
In January, 2005, Cooper agreed to purchase 11% of South Korea-based Kumho Tires Company, and also announced the formation of a new commercial division encompassing both Oliver Rubber Company and commercial tires.
In October, 2005, Cooper announced an agreement to obtain 51% ownership in China’s third largest tire manufacturer, Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Passenger Tire Company Ltd., and Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Truck Tire Company Ltd., to produce truck and passenger car tires for mainland Chinese and export markets.[7] Two of the businesses of the joint venture are Cooper Chengshan Passenger Tire, and Cooper Chengshan Tire.[8] In 2007 Cooper set up a manufacturing venture in eastern China with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, a company based in Taiwan. Cooper generates 25% of its global sales in China.[7] In 2007 Cooper sold its Oliver Rubber Company subsidiary, which produced tread rubber and retreading equipment, to Michelin for $69 million.[9][10]
At the end of 2011, Cooper bought Serbian tire company Trayal from Kruševac. Cooper took over a unit of Trayal Korporacija AD from Bulgarian company Brikel EAD for $13 million and invest as much as $50 million.
On June 12, 2013, a deal was finalized in which Apollo Tyres of India would buy Cooper for $2.5 billion. This move would have made Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. the only major U.S. tire manufacturer. Cooper is the second largest U.S.-based tire company, after Goodyear.[11] On December 30, 2013 Apollo pulled out of the deal since Cooper has not disclosed vital information about its lack of control over its Chinese business. The Chinese plant went on an indefinite strike against the proposed acquisition forcing Apollo to try to lower the $35-per-share bid in the original deal.[12]
Tire brands[edit]
Cooper Tires[edit]
Cooper Tires produces Cooper branded tires for passenger cars, light trucks, sport utility vehicles and commercial trucks.[13]




Avon Tyres Logo


Avon Rubber PLC[edit]
In 1997, the tire business of Avon Rubber PLC of Melksham, Wiltshire, in the United Kingdom was sold to Cooper. This left Avon able to concentrate on its core businesses of automotive components, technical products, and protective equipment. Cooper Tire remains a major employer in central Melksham.
Other brands[edit]
In addition to Avon, Cooper Tire manufactures tires under the associated brand names Dean, Mastercraft, Mickey Thompson, Roadmaster, and Starfire.[14] Cooper Tire formerly manufactured all tires sold under the Sears Guardsman brand at Sears, Roebuck & Co. stores. Cooper manufactures tires for Discount Tire Company under the Arizonian brand name, and Futura Tires for Pep Boys. Cooper Tire also manufactures Hercules branded tires in Findlay, Ohio. Cooper tires can be purchased at many tire retailers, like Tire Discounters, Pep Boys, Discount Tire, and more.
Motorsports and sponsorships[edit]




Cooper racing tires (A1GP)


Avon, then part of Avon Rubber PLC, was involved in Formula One in the 1950s (1954 and from 1956 to 1959), then in 1981 and 1982.
Cooper became the official tire of the A1 Grand Prix, dubbed the World Cup of Motorsports, for the series' initial 2005-2006 season and was under contract to produce slick tires and treaded rain tires for the series championship until 2008.
Since 1982, Avon Tyres had been the sole supplier for the British Formula Three Championship. From the 2009 season onwards, these were re-branded "Cooper" as Cooper became the championship's official title sponsor, and will be until the end of the 2014 season at least.[15] Avon Tyres was also the exclusive supplier for the FIA Formula Two Championship when revived in 2009 to 2012.[16]
In April, 2010, Cooper/Avon Tyres presented a written proposal to Formula One Team Association (FOTA) to be the official tire supplier for the 2011 Formula One season.[17] This was ultimately rejected and Pirelli became the official tire supplier for 2011 onwards.
In the United States, Cooper became the official tire of the Champ Car Atlantic Championship in 2007. Cooper became the official tire of the IMSA Prototype Lites series (formerly IMSA Lites) in 2010.[18] Cooper Tires is the official supplier of the Mazda Road to Indy formula ladder: USF2000 (since 2010), Pro Mazda (since 2013) and Indy Lights (since 2014).
As of 2014, Cooper is the official supplier of the FIA World Rallycross Championship.[19]
On the 7th of July 2017, it was announced that Avon Tyres would be the primary kit sponsor for Championship side Derby County for the 2017/2018 season.

History[edit]
The earliest corporate lineage for Cooper Tire was the M and M Manufacturing Company, founded in 1914 in Akron, Ohio by John F. Schaefer and Claude E. Hart, who were related by marriage. Their new company produced tire patches, tire cement and tire repair kits. They purchased The Giant Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, a tire rebuilding business, in 1920, and in 1922 moved the business to Findlay, Ohio,[2] at a site at the intersection of Lima and Western avenues that is still occupied by Cooper Tire, adjacent to The Cooper Corporation facility. The Cooper name originates from 1919 when Cincinnati auto-parts dealer I. J. Cooper formed The Cooper Corporation in Findlay, to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the Master Tire and Rubber Company. The company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company in 1946.[3]
The Cooper oval trademark with the Cooper Knight headgear was first registered and used in 1941.

Motorsports and sponsorships[edit]




Cooper racing tires (A1GP)


Avon, then part of Avon Rubber PLC, was involved in Formula One in the 1950s (1954 and from 1956 to 1959), then in 1981 and 1982.
Cooper became the official tire of the A1 Grand Prix, dubbed the World Cup of Motorsports, for the series' initial 2005-2006 season and was under contract to produce slick tires and treaded rain tires for the series championship until 2008.
Since 1982, Avon Tyres had been the sole supplier for the British Formula Three Championship. From the 2009 season onwards, these were re-branded "Cooper" as Cooper became the championship's official title sponsor, and will be until the end of the 2014 season at least.[15] Avon Tyres was also the exclusive supplier for the FIA Formula Two Championship when revived in 2009 to 2012.[16]
In April, 2010, Cooper/Avon Tyres presented a written proposal to Formula One Team Association (FOTA) to be the official tire supplier for the 2011 Formula One season.[17] This was ultimately rejected and Pirelli became the official tire supplier for 2011 onwards.
In the United States, Cooper became the official tire of the Champ Car Atlantic Championship in 2007. Cooper became the official tire of the IMSA Prototype Lites series (formerly IMSA Lites) in 2010.[18] Cooper Tires is the official supplier of the Mazda Road to Indy formula ladder: USF2000 (since 2010), Pro Mazda (since 2013) and Indy Lights (since 2014).
As of 2014, Cooper is the official supplier of the FIA World Rallycross Championship.[19]
On the 7th of July 2017, it was announced that Avon Tyres would be the primary kit sponsor for Championship side Derby County for the 2017/2018 season.
Management and company personnel[edit]
Cooper has 10,540 employees as of its 2016 annual report. Bradley E. Hughes is Cooper's President, and CEO.[20]

History[edit]
The earliest corporate lineage for Cooper Tire was the M and M Manufacturing Company, founded in 1914 in Akron, Ohio by John F. Schaefer and Claude E. Hart, who were related by marriage. Their new company produced tire patches, tire cement and tire repair kits. They purchased The Giant Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, a tire rebuilding business, in 1920, and in 1922 moved the business to Findlay, Ohio,[2] at a site at the intersection of Lima and Western avenues that is still occupied by Cooper Tire, adjacent to The Cooper Corporation facility. The Cooper name originates from 1919 when Cincinnati auto-parts dealer I. J. Cooper formed The Cooper Corporation in Findlay, to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the Master Tire and Rubber Company. The company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company in 1946.[3]
The Cooper oval trademark with the Cooper Knight headgear was first registered and used in 1941. In those early years of the brand's identification, the logo also included a banner proclaiming the tires' "armored-cord" construction. The company's red, white, and blue logo would become one of the most easily recognized emblems in the tire industry.
During World War II the company, known as Master Tire and Rubber, manufactured pontoons, landing boats, waterproof bags and camouflage items, inflatable barges, life jackets and tank decoys, as well as tires, to supply the Allied forces. The U.S. government recognized the company's contribution to the war effort in a 1945 ceremony bestowing the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award (for excellence). Soon after the war (1946) the company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company.
From 1946 to 1982, Cooper Tire was headed by a member of the Brewer family: first W.B. Brewer, then his sons, Wayne and Edward. Another son, Robert, was a vice president. W.B. Brewer took Cooper Tire public, and on July 11, 1960, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the callsign "CTB," the callsign's "B" standing for "Brewer." Throughout their tenure, the Brewers set a tone for hands-on leadership, management mingling with workers, and taking care of them. They built the trust and loyalty of the workers.[4]
Under the Brewers' leadership, Cooper Tire grew significantly. By 1983, the company joined the ranks of Fortune 500 companies as one of the largest industrial companies in the United States.[5]
In 1997, Cooper purchased Avon Tyres Ltd, based in Melksham, England.
The company's largest growth acquisition occurred in 1999 when it bought The Standard Products Company, which increased Cooper's total workforce by 10,000 employees. Dearborn, Mich.-based Standard Products produced sealing, plastic trim and vibration-control systems for the automotive original-equipment industry worldwide. The purchase included Standard Products subsidiaries Oliver Rubber Company and Holm Industries Inc. Oliver Rubber manufactured tread rubber and equipment for the truck-retread industry. Holm produced seals for home and commercial refrigerators.[6]
In December, 2003, Cooper agreed to a joint venture with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, to construct a tire-manufacturing plant near Shanghai.
In January, 2005, Cooper agreed to purchase 11% of South Korea-based Kumho Tires Company, and also announced the formation of a new commercial division encompassing both Oliver Rubber Company and commercial tires.
In October, 2005, Cooper announced an agreement to obtain 51% ownership in China’s third largest tire manufacturer, Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Passenger Tire Company Ltd., and Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Truck Tire Company Ltd., to produce truck and passenger car tires for mainland Chinese and export markets.[7] Two of the businesses of the joint venture are Cooper Chengshan Passenger Tire, and Cooper Chengshan Tire.[8] In 2007 Cooper set up a manufacturing venture in eastern China with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, a company based in Taiwan. Cooper generates 25% of its global sales in China.[7] In 2007 Cooper sold its Oliver Rubber Company subsidiary, which produced tread rubber and retreading equipment, to Michelin for $69 million.[9][10]
At the end of 2011, Cooper bought Serbian tire company Trayal from Kruševac. Cooper took over a unit of Trayal Korporacija AD from Bulgarian company Brikel EAD for $13 million and invest as much as $50 million.
On June 12, 2013, a deal was finalized in which Apollo Tyres of India would buy Cooper for $2.5 billion. This move would have made Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. the only major U.S. tire manufacturer. Cooper is the second largest U.S.-based tire company, after Goodyear.[11] On December 30, 2013 Apollo pulled out of the deal since Cooper has not disclosed vital information about its lack of control over its Chinese business. The Chinese plant went on an indefinite strike against the proposed acquisition forcing Apollo to try to lower the $35-per-share bid in the original deal.[12]
Tire brands[edit]
Cooper Tires[edit]
Cooper Tires produces Cooper branded tires for passenger cars, light trucks, sport utility vehicles and commercial trucks.[13]




Avon Tyres Logo


Avon Rubber PLC[edit]
In 1997, the tire business of Avon Rubber PLC of Melksham, Wiltshire, in the United Kingdom was sold to Cooper. This left Avon able to concentrate on its core businesses of automotive components, technical products, and protective equipment. Cooper Tire remains a major employer in central Melksham.
Other brands[edit]
In addition to Avon, Cooper Tire manufactures tires under the associated brand names Dean, Mastercraft, Mickey Thompson, Roadmaster, and Starfire.[14] Cooper Tire formerly manufactured all tires sold under the Sears Guardsman brand at Sears, Roebuck & Co. stores. Cooper manufactures tires for Discount Tire Company under the Arizonian brand name, and Futura Tires for Pep Boys. Cooper Tire also manufactures Hercules branded tires in Findlay, Ohio. Cooper tires can be purchased at many tire retailers, like Tire Discounters, Pep Boys, Discount Tire, and more.

Cooper Tire & Rubber: Understanding The Company's Chronic Underperformance - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (NYSE:CTB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cooper Tire & Rubber: Understanding The Company's Chronic UnderperformanceJun. 2.17 | About: Cooper Tire (CTB) Michael Boyd Long/short equity, contrarian, medium-term horizon, mid-capMarketplaceIndustrial InsightsSummaryCooper Tire is small, but it is a retail investor favorite: cheap valuation, strong management, easy to understand business model.However, the company has been dirt cheap for a while now, and the recent sell-off shows that it can be punished just as much as high-flying momentum names.There are problems here, mainly with cash management and heavy capital spending. Research and development expenditures seem low compared to peers.Q1 2017 was a lesson on just how fragile the company can be if competitors get aggressive. Stay watchful.I think Cooper Tire & Rubber (NYSE:CTB) has likely been a long-term holding of many value investors and one that has brought a lot of frustration. To many, it checks a lot of boxes that investors look for: the company has a long and storied history with a great management team, a strong market position, is perpetually cheap (4-5x EV/EBITDA), and generates quality underlying GAAP earnings with little to no funny business via non-GAAP adjustments. Overall global tire demand remains strong, and the company's strategic transformation is on track according to the big guys in the executive suite. So, what are the underlying issues here, and why does this company seem to have such a hard time seeing some trading multiple expansion? I'll be a little harsh here, but I'm going to try and touch on the negative facets of the Cooper Tire story. Strategic Transformation Like most tire manufacturers, Cooper Tire is trying to shift up the value chain into higher margin products. The first step there means moving away from tires sold to original equipment ("OE") manufacturers and towards replacement tires. Historically, having your tire on an OE vehicle was a solid recipe for generating replacement revenue down the line; many consumers simply replace the tires on their vehicle with the same brand and model when a change is due. However, in return for that privilege, as well as to reap benefits from buying large volumes, OEs demanded rock bottom pricing. Margins were, and are, very thin as a result in this side of the business.
 Sadly, management does not break out sales mix between OE and replacement in any of its presentations or SEC filings. However, you can find signs of this reality within the company's current operations - just take a look at the International Tire segment. Cooper Tire has seen much stronger growth internationally (37.5% y/y in Q1 2017, or $39M increase in revenue) but still posted a $3M contraction in gross profit within the segment after that growth. This is because the company is partnering with OE Asian manufacturers to help build a presence; increased sales are a wash. Unfortunately, that situation is a burden that must be shouldered by smaller market participants. Even domestically, I don't believe Cooper Tire has the size to be ignoring the OE market as much as it is. While it is the fifth largest U.S. manufacturer, the brands within its portfolio have very little name recognition with consumers, in my opinion. This translates to the replacement market where that brand recognition matters, and if that piece of the puzzle is missing, it is forced to compete heavily on price or face consequences (see Q1 results discussion below as an example). Likewise, Cooper Tires' continued shift into premium-branded products (performance tires, larger rim diameters), largely built upon new product launches, also to some extent relies on that brand recognition story. Eventually, consumer funds will flow to the most compelling product lines based on performance and results, and perception of value will follow. However, to me, the company seems to be going about this the wrong way. Cooper Tire continues to invest heavily in technical capability via the expansion of its Asian Technical Center, as well as significantly expanding its production facilities; capex guidance for 2017 of $235M at the midpoint is a significant expansion from prior year levels. These efforts, however, seem more directed at improving efficiency and yields rather than developing inventive or new products that would really catapult the company forward. Granularly, the research and development budget has remained relatively flat over the past several years ($55M annual average) at Cooper Tire. That is less than 2% of sales, and it means much larger competitors like Goodyear Tire (NYSE:GT) and Bridgestone (OTCPK:BRDCY), which see annual sales of 7-10 times that of Cooper Tire, are significantly outspending the company on product research as a percentage of revenue (2.5% and 2.9% of sales, respectively). I don't see how the company can expect to win premium market share when it is getting outspent on both a nominal and percentage basis.
 Q1 2017's Trainwreck The market did not take kindly to Cooper Tire's Q1 results, sending the shares down double digits at times. Weakness continued post earnings release, and unfortunately, Cooper Tire has seen more than 15% of its value cut at the same time as the market has been marginally up. During the quarter, American tire sales fell 8.3% to $532M due to a 7.4% decline in volume. Gross margin fell 610 bps to 17.1%, helping drive a butchering of operating margins that were nearly cut in half. The company was pretty firm on pricing in the quarter, despite the fact that competitors were doing aggressive promotions during a period of rising raw material costs. Light vehicle tire sales volume was down 11.3% at Cooper Tire in the quarter, despite the fact that the Rubber Manufacturers Association ("RMA") reported an increase of 1.4% in sales in that segment y/y overall. When volumes fall like this, it impacts the entire company as operating leverage contracts, and the fact that Cooper Tire reports on a last in first out basis ("LIFO"), the impact of higher raw materials only made things worse. This all goes back to the strategic transformation. Q1 should make it clear that Cooper Tire is still a price taker, not a price setter. Tires are a tough market where most consumers don't have the expertise to spot differentiation, and if the competition wants to compete on price, Cooper Tire simply does not have the clout to sit on its hands and not react. While management does expect some improvement heading into Q2 and has noticed its competition lowering promotional activity, I was still surprised to see the company reaffirm its operating margin guidance of 9-10%, and I think the quarter shows how aspirational management's target of "consistently reporting above 10% operating margin" really is. Given Q2 expectations were tempered by management, I'd advise being very careful here lest investors get strung along for another dive come Q2 reporting. If there was any bright spot to be taken from Q1, it was International segment results. While the company saw negative impact y/y when it came to pricing, operations did see significant benefits from manufacturing efficiencies and volume. International operations remain far away from moving the needle in any meaningful way - $2M in Q1 2017 operating profit versus $63M for the Americas business - but there are signs that Cooper Tire is starting to win market share in the ever-important Chinese market. The recent favorable ruling on truck and bus radial ("TBR"), which reversed preliminary tariffs that Cooper Tire had been paying on imported tires from its Chinese manufacturing facilities to America, was also a favorable development.
 Cash Management And Its Impact on Valuation Cooper Tire has had a rough time with working capital over the past several years, culminating in a $240M negative build over 2015/2016. Q1 2017 isn't off to a great start on solving that, with $144M in negative impact, largely inventory driven (as expected given weak Q1 volumes). Unfortunately, any improvement this year that could drive free cash flow improvement is likely to be offset by the large capex budget that I mentioned earlier. Given the $68M net cash position at Cooper Tire on the balance sheet, leverage is not an issue. If the free cash flow was there, I'm sure management would be buying back stock hand over fist. To me, that thin cash availability for shareholder returns is the primary hurdle that keeps Cooper Tire from trading up towards EV/EBITDA multiples of peers (5.5x, or 35% discount), or the broader auto parts supply subsector (most in the 6-8x EBITDA range). I don't mind the business, and the valuation is alluring. But when a company has traded cheaply for years, there are underlying reasons why, and investors should not expect that to change without some sort of catalyst. I don't think the challenges are insurmountable, and there are positives to latch onto, like the balance sheet or growing relevancy of the company's overseas operations. The market will, in the meantime, continue to take a "show me" attitude, particularly into the rest of this year given guidance, and it will be interesting to watch and observe just how well that plays out.

                                Tire evaluations for fleets -- test to get the best
            


            March 3, 2016
        




We’ve all heard the adage: “You get what you pay for.” In many cases that’s true.  Yet, when it comes to the tires in your fleet, it may not be the case. With tires, you can actually get more than you pay for, and if you do, you’re cutting operational costs significantly since tires often represent the second highest expense following fuel.

                    Today In Business: Tire Maker's Shares Sold                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company's largest shareholder, Shapiro Capital Management, reduced its stake in the tire maker by 73 percent in the third quarter. Shapiro Capital held 1.87 million shares in Cooper, or 3 percent of its shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. That compared with 7.01 million shares, or 11 percent of the company, on May 31. Shapiro is now Cooper's 17th-largest shareholder. Shapiro Capital sold shares in the same period that Cooper announced a plan to add $170 million a year in profits by trimming spending and increasing revenue. The tire maker, which had a $9.36 million loss last year, is facing declining demand and higher costs for materials like rubber.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE TO CUT JOBS AND QUIT MAKING INNER TUBES                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company said yesterday that it would cut 129 jobs at a factory in Mississippi and would stop producing inner tubes there because of declining demand. The cuts will result in $7 million of expenses in the third quarter, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cooper Tire, based in Findlay, Ohio, said it would dedicate resources to making other products that would help it expand. Thirty employees will continue working at the factory, in Clarksdale, Miss., the company said.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE'S EARNINGS TO MISS ESTIMATES OF ANALYSTS                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company said it earned 13 cents to 17 cents a share in the second quarter, falling short of analysts' estimates because of higher raw material costs, slower sales and reorganization-related expenses. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expected the company to earn 24 cents a share. Cooper Tire is due to release earnings July 17. The tire maker, based in Findlay, Ohio, closed four plants in the United States for a week in May because of a buildup of unsold tires. That cut 4 cents from earnings per share, while charges related to restructuring cost 2 cents a share, the company said.











                    Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Tire Appeal                
The United States Supreme Court refused today to hear an appeal from a tire maker of a $3.3 million jury award in the 1995 highway death of a Mississippi woman. The court refused to consider the argument by the tire maker, the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, that the size of the award was so excessive that it violated the constitutional right to due process. The justices issued a one-line order without further comment.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE SAYS IT WILL CUT 1,100 JOBS AND CLOSE PLANTS                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 1,100 jobs, or 4.8 percent of its work force, and close, sell or consolidate 18 plants and offices to cut costs. Cooper will take a charge of $35 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter to cover the closings and job cuts. The announcement came as Cooper said third-quarter net income fell 32 percent, to $23.4 million, or 32 cents a share, from $34.6 million, or 45 cents, in the period last year. Sales rose 59 percent, to $843.6 million, from $531.9 million, primarily from its acquisition of the auto-parts maker Standard Products. The company will close plants immediately in Luzerne and Mio, Mich., and in Rocky Mount, N.C. It will also close the Oliver Rubber plant in Dallas.











                    Cooper Tire May Become Focus of a Safety Investigation                
Six weeks after it pressed Bridgestone/Firestone to recall 6.5 million tires, the nation's traffic safety agency said yesterday that it was considering opening an investigation of a second tire maker -- the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company. Dr. Sue Bailey, head of the agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said her office had recently become aware of lawsuits asserting that dozens of deaths and serious injuries had been caused by premature tread separations on tires made by Cooper, the world's fourth-largest tire maker.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE AND RUBBER TO ACQUIRE STANDARD PRODUCTS                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company agreed yesterday to acquire the Standard Products Company for $36.50 a share in cash or stock, or a total of $584.4 million, in a deal that would make Cooper the largest maker of automotive sealing systems in North America. Cooper will also assume $173 million of Standard Products' debt. Cooper, based in Findlay, Ohio, said it expected revenue of $3.2 billion in the combined company's first full year of operation. Standard Products, based in Dearborn, Mich., makes sealing products, plastic trim and vibration control systems. Cooper is the nation's seventh-largest tire manufacturer. Shares of Standard Products soared 40 percent, rising $10, to $35, while Cooper fell 43.75 cents to $22.50.

Pirelli S.p.A., the world's sixth-largest maker of tires, said yesterday that it had formed an alliance with the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, the eighth-largest, which the Italian company hopes will double its North American sales in three years. Cooper will distribute and sell Pirelli passenger and light-truck tires in North America, the world's largest market, which generates some 30 percent of Cooper's sales. In turn, Pirelli will market Cooper tires in the South American market, where it is one of the largest distributors.

                    Today In Business: Tire Maker's Shares Sold                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company's largest shareholder, Shapiro Capital Management, reduced its stake in the tire maker by 73 percent in the third quarter. Shapiro Capital held 1.87 million shares in Cooper, or 3 percent of its shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. That compared with 7.01 million shares, or 11 percent of the company, on May 31. Shapiro is now Cooper's 17th-largest shareholder. Shapiro Capital sold shares in the same period that Cooper announced a plan to add $170 million a year in profits by trimming spending and increasing revenue. The tire maker, which had a $9.36 million loss last year, is facing declining demand and higher costs for materials like rubber.

                    COOPER TIRE TO CUT JOBS AND QUIT MAKING INNER TUBES                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company said yesterday that it would cut 129 jobs at a factory in Mississippi and would stop producing inner tubes there because of declining demand. The cuts will result in $7 million of expenses in the third quarter, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cooper Tire, based in Findlay, Ohio, said it would dedicate resources to making other products that would help it expand. Thirty employees will continue working at the factory, in Clarksdale, Miss., the company said.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE'S EARNINGS TO MISS ESTIMATES OF ANALYSTS                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company said it earned 13 cents to 17 cents a share in the second quarter, falling short of analysts' estimates because of higher raw material costs, slower sales and reorganization-related expenses. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expected the company to earn 24 cents a share. Cooper Tire is due to release earnings July 17. The tire maker, based in Findlay, Ohio, closed four plants in the United States for a week in May because of a buildup of unsold tires. That cut 4 cents from earnings per share, while charges related to restructuring cost 2 cents a share, the company said.











                    Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Tire Appeal                
The United States Supreme Court refused today to hear an appeal from a tire maker of a $3.3 million jury award in the 1995 highway death of a Mississippi woman. The court refused to consider the argument by the tire maker, the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, that the size of the award was so excessive that it violated the constitutional right to due process. The justices issued a one-line order without further comment.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE SAYS IT WILL CUT 1,100 JOBS AND CLOSE PLANTS                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 1,100 jobs, or 4.8 percent of its work force, and close, sell or consolidate 18 plants and offices to cut costs. Cooper will take a charge of $35 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter to cover the closings and job cuts. The announcement came as Cooper said third-quarter net income fell 32 percent, to $23.4 million, or 32 cents a share, from $34.6 million, or 45 cents, in the period last year. Sales rose 59 percent, to $843.6 million, from $531.9 million, primarily from its acquisition of the auto-parts maker Standard Products. The company will close plants immediately in Luzerne and Mio, Mich., and in Rocky Mount, N.C. It will also close the Oliver Rubber plant in Dallas.











                    Cooper Tire May Become Focus of a Safety Investigation                
Six weeks after it pressed Bridgestone/Firestone to recall 6.5 million tires, the nation's traffic safety agency said yesterday that it was considering opening an investigation of a second tire maker -- the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company. Dr. Sue Bailey, head of the agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said her office had recently become aware of lawsuits asserting that dozens of deaths and serious injuries had been caused by premature tread separations on tires made by Cooper, the world's fourth-largest tire maker.










COMPANY NEWS

                    COOPER TIRE AND RUBBER TO ACQUIRE STANDARD PRODUCTS                
The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company agreed yesterday to acquire the Standard Products Company for $36.50 a share in cash or stock, or a total of $584.4 million, in a deal that would make Cooper the largest maker of automotive sealing systems in North America. Cooper will also assume $173 million of Standard Products' debt. Cooper, based in Findlay, Ohio, said it expected revenue of $3.2 billion in the combined company's first full year of operation. Standard Products, based in Dearborn, Mich., makes sealing products, plastic trim and vibration control systems. Cooper is the nation's seventh-largest tire manufacturer. Shares of Standard Products soared 40 percent, rising $10, to $35, while Cooper fell 43.75 cents to $22.50.

Good morning, and welcome to Cooper Tire and Rubber Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants on the call are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jerry Bialek.
Jerry Bialek - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. This is Jerry Bialek, Cooper's Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, and I am here with our Chief Executive Officer, Brad Hughes; and Ginger Jones, our Chief Financial Officer.
During our conversation today, you may hear forward-looking statements related to future financial results and business operations of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company. Actual results may differ materially from current management forecasts and projections. Such differences may be a result of factors over which the company has limited or no control. Information on these risk factors and additional information on forward-looking statements are included in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning and in the company's reports on file with the SEC.
During this call, we will provide an overview of the company's first quarter 2017 financial and operating results, as well as our business outlook. Our earnings release includes a link to a set of slides that summarize information included in the news release and in the 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to participants for a question-and-answer session.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will begin with a brief overview of our first quarter 2017 financial results, and then provide an update on Cooper's progress towards our strategic priorities. Finally, I will highlight some of our operational achievements during the quarter. After that, I will turn the call over to Ginger for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter performance, the current business environment, and capital allocation. I'll return to present our business outlook for the remainder of the year and then we'll take your questions. With that, let's get started.
Results in the first quarter were driven by raw material costs and related pricing activity. As you know, Cooper is on LIFO in the U.S. and rising raw material costs affect our profits sooner. Our pricing actions in the U.S. in response to these raw material increases occurred later in the quarter, and this drove lower margins for our business. In addition, the timing of price increases and aggressive promotions by competitors, as well as weaker sell-out volumes for the whole industry had an impact on our volumes in the U.S. This was partially offset by strong sales in our other regions. Looking forward, some of these industry dynamics will continue into the second quarter.
We believe Cooper is well positioned as we head into the remainder of 2017, as raw materials are beginning to stabilize, price increases are taking hold, and while it is early, we are seeing improving unit order trends in the U.S. market in the second quarter. As a result, we expect U.S. volumes to improve relative to the industry in the second quarter. We also expect margins to improve, and we are reaffirming our full year 2017 operating margin guidance at the high-end of our 8% to 10% range consolidated operating profit margin range.

Now let's get into the details. Net sales for the period were $643 million, down about 1% compared with the same period last year. Operating profit was $49 million, down $42 million, driven by two important factors: higher raw material costs of $50 million with an offset of $8 million from our March price increases and mix improvements; light vehicle volume in the U.S. was down 11.3%, which reduced profits and had a related effect on manufacturing costs, which were up due to the unabsorbed costs from managing inventory levels by lowering output. On the positive side, U.S. TBR unit volume was up 32%, Latin America unit volume was up nearly 16%, and international segment unit volume was up 31%. Combined, global unit volume increased by nearly 3% year-over-year. Ginger will provide more details on the profit changes.
The U.S. light vehicle volume decline I just mentioned compared with the Rubber Manufacturers Associations reported increase of 1.4%, and a total industry increase of 1.1%. Our performance relative to these metrics was primarily due to the timing of competitor price increases, promotional activity, as well as overall weaker sell-out volumes for the industry.
The industry has been implementing price increases. However, the nature and timing of these increases have been varied, and there have been more promotional activities than we expected, affecting buyer behavior in the market. In the U.S., Cooper implemented price increases on March 1. We went with a straightforward price increase, while competitors used a variety of approaches, including delayed timing, price protection programs, and promotions. This variation in approach created a negative short-term volume impact in the first quarter for Cooper, as it motivated some customers to buy from the competition ahead of expected price increases.
We also saw increased sales channel inventories across the industry, although we believe inventories for Cooper are in reasonable shape. At $49 million, Cooper ended the first quarter with an operating profit margin of 7.6% of net sales, near the low-end of our 8% to 10% guidance. The quarter also included multiple unusual items totaling a net benefit of $12 million. These unusual items include the reversal of preliminary TBR tariffs incurred in 2016, which totaled $22 million. The $22 million benefit of the tariff reversal was partially offset by $7 million of certain direct expenses associated with the damages from a tornado at the leased distribution center in Albany, Georgia, and $3 million to write off certain assets related to the company's global ERP system implementation.
In addition to the direct costs noted above, the tornado damage also affected our distribution to certain customers and markets in the U.S. Although hard to quantify, this also had a negative impact on our first quarter results. Each of these factors will be discussed in more detail later in the call.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.57, down from $1.05 a year ago. Cooper continued to return cash to shareholders through our capital allocation plan, which Ginger will discuss in more detail. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders, as evidenced by the $300 million share repurchase program recently authorized by our Board, but we will be opportunistic as we implement the purchases. I'm pleased to report that we continue to earn strong returns on our investment, delivering a 16.6% return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters.
Cooper will continue to execute our strategic plan priorities of driving top line profitable growth, developing a highly competitive cost structure, and building even stronger organizational capabilities. Significant changes to our business model, including positive mix transformation, improved speed to market with exciting new products and cost efficiencies have allowed us to structurally improve operating margins over time. These business model improvements will help Cooper to respond and succeed over the longer term, including during periods of rising raw material costs and product pricing fluctuation.

We continue to focus on our house brands and on satisfying demand for tires with larger rim diameters and other high margin features. New product introductions and innovation continue to play a significant role in driving growth for Cooper. We continue to shorten our product development cycle time. In fact, we have reduced it by over 30% since 2011. This capability to respond quickly to customer requirements is a key enabler for our success in Asia, where we have achieved over 80% domestic volume growth versus the prior year. In Latin America, tailored product offerings along with expanded distribution helped us to achieve broader market penetration and a corresponding year-over-year domestic unit volume increase of 13.2%.
In the U.S., we are growing our TBR business, and again, significantly outperform the industry with a strong product offering including new tires like the SmartWay verified RMA 52, which provides long-lasting mileage and improved traction in challenging weather. Our engineers designed this tire with a compound that offers not only lower rolling resistance for fuel economy, but also a deep tread that can stand up to the demands of the road. It showcases the performance for which our Roadmaster tires are known and illustrates how committed we are to continuing to develop tires that meet the needs of our customers.
We are leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and near-source supply strategy while maintaining a focus on reducing costs to secure our value proposition and enhanced profit margins. In the U.S., we are adding more automation at our facilities to strengthen our long-term competitiveness. In Europe, we are investing in new tire building equipment at our Serbia plant to expand capacity and build larger diameter tires, leveraging this cost-effective facility for future growth, not only in Europe but also in the Middle East and other markets around the world. In Asia, we continue to upgrade plant capabilities and install equipment to support growth and meet the rigorous requirements of our OE customers.
Now shifting gears to external factors. As we said during our last call, there are significant headwinds and challenges facing the industry and the company in 2017. These include volatile raw material costs, competitive promotions and product pricing activity, uncertainty over tax and trade policies, and the changing global political environment. Our raw material index was sequentially up during the first quarter from 147 in the fourth quarter to 166.3 in the first quarter, as shown on page 5 of the supplemental slide deck. This was over 26% higher than the 131.5 index for the first quarter of 2016. The raw material index trend during the first quarter was up sequentially in January, February and March. As we look forward, we anticipate that raw material costs will be up modestly in the second quarter and will stabilize in the second half of the year.
After the broad round of industry price increases announced in the first quarter, we've now seen a large competitor announce a new price increase in the U.S. So we expect the product pricing and program activity will continue during the second quarter. Cooper's March price increase is fully implemented, and we will continue to be market-facing including promotional programs as appropriate. Again, we expect our U.S. unit volume to improve relative to the industry during the second quarter, and anticipate that our price increases will deliver more benefit with a full quarter's impact.
For the second half of the year, we expect our U.S. unit volume to be in line with the industry. We remain committed to our long-term approach to recover input cost increases in line with the industry. Overall, we believe that global production capacity remains balanced, and as the industry continues to shift towards larger rim diameter and more complex tires, capacity for these HVA tires remains below current demand, which supports a rational pricing environment going forward.

Turning to tariffs, on February 22, the United States International Trade Commission determined that there was no material injury to the U.S. tire industry from TBR tires produced in China and imported into the United States. This means there will be no antidumping or countervailing duties on TBR tires from China, and that all of the preliminary tariffs collected during this process are being refunded. Because all of our TBR tires are presently sourced from China, this ruling is positive for Cooper. As noted in our release, this resulted in a benefit of $22 million in the first quarter of 2017 for the reversal of the tariff costs incurred in 2016.
Now, we would like to talk about some of the operational achievements we had in the first quarter. First, I want to congratulate the team at our Tupelo, Mississippi facility. The Rubber Manufacturers Association has again recognized Tupelo with its prestigious Safety and Health Improvement Program award. This is the fourth time in the past five years that Tupelo has received this award. The safety and health of our employees is our top priority.
In Europe, we had domestic unit volume growth of nearly 20%, reflecting strength in the U.K. market and the success of new products. For example, our new Cooper Zeon 4XS Sport SUV tire placed in the top 2 of 15 tires from leading brands and earned a highly recommended rating in the most recent annual test of summer tires by the very influential ADAC. The ADAC is a respected testing body in Germany relied upon by many European consumers for guidance on vehicle and tire quality and safety. In summary, I'm confident in our business model, our team, and in our ability to rise to the challenges presented.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ginger for an update on the financial results and capital allocation.
Ginger M. Jones - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Thank you, Brad. I'll start with our first quarter highlights. Net sales were $643 million compared with $650 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 1%. While overall unit volume increased, there was an overall negative impact to sales during the quarter, as Cooper sold fewer units in North America, a region with a typically higher average price per tire. This resulted in a net reduction to sales of $11 million. We also experienced $9 million of negative foreign currency impact. These reductions were partially offset by $13 million of favorable price and mix, primarily attributable to net price increases related to the higher raw material costs.
Operating profit was $49 million or 7.6% of sales, compared with $91 million or 14% of sales in 2016. First quarter operating profit as compared with the same period in 2016 was impacted by the following factors, which are summarized on page 6 of the supplemental slide deck, $50 million of unfavorable raw material costs. As a reminder, ongoing tariff costs are included in raw material costs in the quarter when incurred. We also had $8 million of favorable price and mix. Combined, these factors totaled to $42 million of unfavorable raw material costs net of price and mix, as the implementation of product pricing lag raw material cost increases. As Brad mentioned earlier, in the U.S., we use the LIFO accounting method. So our results reflect the impact of changing material costs more quickly than most competitors.
We had $10 million of higher manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes in North America, $5 million of lower unit volume driven by the unit volume decline in North America, $3 million of higher other costs, which include $7 million of direct costs related to the tornado damages, $2 million of negative foreign currency impact, and $2 million of unfavorable SG&A costs, which include $3 million related to the write-off of certain assets for the company's global ERP system implementation. As you know, we implemented ERP in the U.S. and are planning a global implementation.

As part of this rollout effort and as we evaluate which systems to use in each region, we have assessed our global plan and written off certain assets related to the project. These negative factors were partially offset by $22 million of benefit for the reversal of tariffs incurred in 2016. We delivered earnings per share of $0.57, compared with $1.05 in the first quarter of 2016. A contribution of $0.03 per share came from the lower share count resulting from our share repurchase program.
Moving to our segment performance, I'll start with the Americas tire operations. Segment sales for the first quarter were $531 million, down 8.3% from $575 million in 2016. This decrease was the result of $43 million of lower unit volume, $4 million of negative foreign currency impact, and $1 million of unfavorable price and mix. First quarter operating profit in the Americas was $63 million or 11.9% of net sales, compared with $106 million or 18.3% of net sales in the same period last year.
Operating profit was impacted by $37 million of unfavorable raw material costs net of price and mix, $12 million of higher manufacturing costs with cost savings during the quarter, which were more than offset by costs from actions taken to manage inventory levels, $11 million of lower unit volume, $6 million of other expense, which includes $7 million in direct costs related to the tornado damage, and $1 million of negative foreign currency. These were partially offset by the $22 million of tariff reversal benefit and $2 million of favorable SG&A costs.
The previously referenced $7 million in expenses related to the tornado damage in the first quarter includes direct costs incurred in the quarter to destroy damaged tires, freight to move products to other warehouses, and professional fees to secure and maintain the site. We expect that these costs less the deductible will be recovered from our insurance carriers at some point in the future.
The estimates of full year 2016 direct costs for tornado damages is expected to be between $12 million and $14 million. These costs do not include indirect costs or the impact of business disruption, which affected our results in the first quarter, and will continue to do so in the future. We will seek to recover such costs from insurance carriers. You can see the full profit walk for the Americas on slide 7 of our supplemental slide deck.
Now turning to our international tire operations. As a reminder, all results for the international segment include the consolidated results of our new joint venture, GRT. Net sales for the first quarter were $142 million, up 37.5% from the first quarter of 2016. Unit volume in the segment was 31.4% higher in the first quarter of 2017, compared to the prior year as a result of increases in both Asia and Europe. Sales increased by $39 million as a result of $28 million of higher unit volume and $16 million of favorable price and mix, which was partially offset by $5 million of negative foreign currency impact. The international segment improved its operating results compared with last year with an operating profit of $2 million in the first quarter, compared to an operating loss of $2 million in the same period a year ago.
These results were driven by $5 million of higher unit volume, $3 million of favorable manufacturing costs, and $1 million of favorable other costs, which were partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable raw material costs net of price and mix, $1 million of unfavorable SG&A expense, and $1 million of negative foreign currency impact. You can see the full profit walk for the international operations segment on slide 8 of our supplemental slide deck. This was a great quarter for the international segment, which is driving unit volume growth and improvement in operating margins.

Now, turning to some corporate items, the effective tax rate was 30.7% for the first quarter, compared with 32.3% for the same period last year. The decrease in the rate is primarily due to the implementation of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 under which excess tax benefits from share-based payments must be recognized discretely in the period in which they occur. The effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual earnings and tax rates for the various tax jurisdiction in which the company operates. We estimate the full year 2017 effective tax rate to be in a range of 30% to 33%. More details on our taxes is available in the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today.
Cash and cash equivalents were $365 million at March 31, 2017, compared with $434 million at March 31, 2016. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $45 million. We anticipate our full-year capital expenditures for 2017 to be between $220 million and $250 million. We believe this is the appropriate level of capital to support our ongoing modernization, mix transformation, and automation initiatives in addition to investments in capacity to align with our global strategic growth plans.
Moving to capital returns, in February 2017, our Board extended and increased our share repurchase program by authorizing the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2019. During the first quarter, approximately 473,000 shares were repurchased for $17.8 million at an average price of $37.63 per share. Since share repurchase began in August 2014, the company has repurchased a total of 12.7 million shares at an average price of $34.21 per share.
I want to remind you that Cooper believes that our existing cash, cash flows and potential leverage are more than sufficient to support our capital allocation priorities. We define those priorities as supporting our ongoing commitments, capital to support organic growth and margin improvement initiative, acquisitions and partnerships, and funding our dividend and share repurchase goals. We believe our operating performance, our sustained high level of ROIC, and our demonstrated commitment to delivering on our strategic plan, including a balanced approach to capital allocation, delivers long-term value to shareholders.
I'll now turn the call back to Brad for perspective on the balance of the year.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Thanks, Ginger. In summary, the first quarter was one of transition, as we absorbed higher raw material costs and implemented product price increases. Our strategy to diversify and grow our non-U.S. businesses is paying off, as we saw very strong unit volume growth in our faster growing markets of Asia and Latin America, and a continued turnaround with double-digit unit volume growth in Europe. The growth in these businesses more than offset the short-term unit volume disruption we experienced in the U.S. That said, we recognize that North America is the largest segment of our business, and we are laser-focused on responding to market factors and improving our results there.
Looking ahead, while raw material costs seem to be stabilizing, we expect that additional price and promotional activity will affect U.S. volumes in the second quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect continued strong unit volume growth in our international segment and in Latin America. We continue to closely monitor the raw material and related pricing environment and currently project that pricing dynamics will normalize in the coming quarters.
Our unit volume in the U.S. is expected to improve relative to the industry for the second quarter and be in line with the industry in the second half of the year. We still believe that first half operating profit margin will be around the low-end of our 8% to 10% range. With raw material costs projected to level off in the coming quarters and product pricing actions in place, we anticipate that full year 2017 operating profit margin will be at the high-end of our previously announced midterm target of 8% to 10% with operating profit margin exceeding 10% in the second half of the year.

We remain confident in the strength of the Cooper business model, and we believe significant levers remain to further improve our business based on continued execution of our strategic plan. These levers are cost reductions in the way we design and manufacture our products, including automation and process improvement and in how we procure our materials, mix enhancement with a continued shift to larger, more premium HVA tires driven by trends in OE vehicles, growth and scale, particularly in Asia and Latin America, optimization of our global manufacturing footprint, and continuing to expand margins in the international segment. With these opportunities and others, we are confident that as price increases are implemented and raw material costs stabilize, further improvements in operating profit will be achieved.
With that, let's move to your questions. Operator, will you take the first question, please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Christopher Van Horn with FBR. Please go ahead.
Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my call.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Hi, Chris.
Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Hi. So the back half of – the guidance for the back half implies pretty strong margins. And I just wanted to kind of jump into pricing here. Is that kind of the main driver in order to get us there? Or are there other levers you can pull if pricing doesn't really pan out? And then, just kind of your commentary maybe so far this month what you're seeing from a pricing perspective. Are we starting to see those prices go through? And just kind of your confidence level there.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Let me go at it in reverse order. I'll start and then sequentially move into the second half. But as we look at how we are transitioning out of the first quarter and into the second quarter, the industry has been implementing price increases. They've come in all kinds of different forms as we alluded to during the commentary a moment ago. There was price protection for a period of time to allow people to bring orders in; there were later announcements.
Some of the larger players have had price increases that aren't effective until April 1 or even May 1. So all of that continues to come into play. We are seeing a relative level of promotional activity that may be a little bit higher than it would be at this time of year in other years. But overall, it looks like the pricing is coming into the market. It's just a matter of getting it all in and in place, and everybody resettling into their appropriate positions on a competitive basis. And we think that will happen largely in the second quarter.
As that is completing itself, that process, we do anticipate to see our volumes improve relative to the market, although we don't know if we will get all the way back to performing at market levels in the second quarter. As we move into – and I'm going to stay on the volume theme for a moment here, Chris. As we move into the second half of the year and we think that the market has digested the price increases, as raw materials will have stabilized, that at that point in time, we will see our volume move back in line with at least in line with the market in the U.S. So, from a volume perspective, that's our outlook for our business. We do think that pricing is going to play an important role in what's going on in the industry, as we move into the second and then into the second half of the year.
We really haven't seen anything to suggest that people are not going to follow through with the pricing that they've announced and put in. There will be promotional activity as there always is, but we think that there will be pricing in the market in line with what's happened with raw materials. Now as we're looking at raw materials, we're talking, our projection is that we'll see a modest increase in the second quarter and then a stabilization. Some of the more important commodities we've actually even seen the potential that there may be some decline as we move forward. So we'll continue to monitor that.

For Cooper, in addition to the pricing and on margin improvement along with stable raw materials that we expect to see moving into the second half, we continue to have a number of cost initiatives underway that we also think will contribute to our margin improvement.
Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Great. Thanks for that color. That's very helpful. On the positive side, the international markets did very well. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little more detail. I know you said Europe and Asia are both contributors, but a little more detail on was one outsized versus the other? And then, was it OEM versus replacement business and just what you're seeing in those marketplaces?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Yeah. Just to clarify a couple of the comments that I made in – it was in both. But so if we talk about Asia and Europe specifically we talked about an 80% increase in domestic volumes in Asia in the first quarter year-over-year. That was – it was both OEM, replacement but OE was clearly the stronger contributor to that growth. In Europe, we had double-digit increases, close to 20% in that market, and a lot of that driven by a stronger U.K. market, which is important to our business, both from a volume and a profit perspective, along with an overall continuation of a refreshing of the product portfolio there and having more competitive products that are helping us in all of our markets in Europe.

Our next question is from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning, everybody. I've had a couple things to follow up. First, was hoping to dive in a little bit more into this 11% drop in the U.S. It's because I don't recall certainly not recently any period of this magnitude of variance for you guys verse the industry. So, just in terms of a further explanation, do you believe that it's tire companies managing their pricing to FIFO whereas you guys obviously have to face the LIFO impact? Is the promotional activity centered in there any area like within LVA or within certain brand tiers? Or are you seeing it pretty broadly?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Yeah. So this is a more significant deviation from the industry, although there is one example to this in my tenure here that goes back to 2011 that was somewhat similar. And I only raised that because at that time, again, we saw it was significant movements in raw materials, tire companies making their pricing changes to respond to that, and the timing and the implementation of it was a bit choppy there as well, and it hit us for a couple of months. We responded and moved back in line with the market in a relatively short order. I can't say that this will be exactly the same situation, but we do have confidence that we know how to respond to what we're seeing.
With regard to LIFO, I can't comment on what other people do. Certainly, we are incentivized to respond as early as we can because we are seeing the impact in our profitability from increases in raw materials sooner than others that are not on LIFO, which, to my knowledge, we're the only ones on LIFO in the U.S. So, there is clearly an incentive for us to move earlier, however, we also are looking at the market and trying to remain market-facing. As we'd looked at some of the announcements that came out in the early part of the quarter, we jumped on those and jumped in with our price increase with an anticipation about how those would be implemented and how the rest of the industry would follow.
As it turns out, we ended up implementing effective March 1, and others, even some that implemented March 1 may have protected orders through the end of the quarter to try and drive some volume, several others announced price increases that weren't effective until April or May. There was promotional activity that came in behind some of the price increases. So there were a number of things that were moving around.

I think the important points, though, Rod, are, one, there is pricing and it does look like the pricing is going to remain in the market. We'll see during this quarter, the next couple of months to finalize that comment, but it does appear that that's the case. And as that's coming into line and as we have better insights into what our key competitors are doing on key segments, we're realigning where we're at to make sure that we're appropriately market-facing with our pricing. And as we've done that, as I mentioned, it's a little bit early, but we've seen a nice response in our orders so far in April.
So I wouldn't say that it's honed in on any particular segment in terms of the activity. I just think this is the way that it has to happen, as various competitors are coming in with their own unique approaches to pricing. But once that's in place, we still have the same competitive product lineup we've had. And we still know how to position ourselves, and we still have great relationships with our customers.
Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. And in terms of the raw material cost inflation that you're expecting for the year, if raw stay stable at this level, is it still just under about $300 million impact for you guys on a full year basis? And do you still believe that raw material costs could be fully offset for you guys in the back half?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, we haven't quantified the dollar impact of the raw materials. We're staying with the guidance that we provide on the raw material index. And again, there will be timing that will affect this, but we continue to believe that the industry, given that the backdrop of a balanced supply and demand and even in undersupply relative to the demand for HVA products, that the pricing environment is such that we would expect the industry is going to price to recover increases in raw materials, albeit with a lag.
Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. But earlier, I think on the last call, you were pretty explicit in saying that you thought that by the back half, price and mix will fully offset the raw materials, if I remember correctly. Is there less conviction in that or is that still a goal?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
No. Again, we think that that is still on a reasonable outlook right now, based on what we can see, and again, I know that we've said this a number of times, but we are reaffirming our guidance around margins for the full year and including the second half.
Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Right, okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Good morning.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Hi, Brett.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
On the topic of the volume, can you talk about the first quarter kind of on month-by-month basis? I mean, it seems like that's something that would have maybe impacted the latter, perhaps, half of the quarter as opposed to January and February?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
I would suggest that the volume trend was impacted by the pricing. We're making that point in this discussion. And our pricing went into effect March 1, and not everybody else went at that point in time. And so, yeah. As the pricing announcements came out and the way that those were executed was better understood by the market, it began to have an effect. And so, I would say that it's accurate to think that the latter part of the quarter was more affected.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
And as we look at kind of April, I mean, we're largely through April at this point in time, how can you assess how things have maybe improved here in the second quarter thus far?

Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, what we can monitor, Brett, is our order pattern. I mean, that's what we can see. And so, as we're looking at how the orders are coming in for us relative to a year ago and relative to the first quarter, we're indicating that we're seeing improving trends. Unless there's a real significant change in what's going on in the overall industry, which we wouldn't have view to yet, we think that that will suggest that our performance is improving relative to the industry.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then switching gears here, as I think about your guidance and the reversal of the tariff, truck tariff, how should I think about – that normally would've had a – I think a pretty material positive impact on your guidance here, I think we're basically, if I remember correctly, reiterating your guidance. So, what would be the offset? Would it primarily be a weaker than expected first quarter and second quarter?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, there's like a few factors that play here, Brett. Firstly, when we talked about the tariff initially, when we believed there was going to be a tariff in place, we indicated at that time that we thought that the industry would take some pricing as a result of that, given the supply and demand of the TBR market for the U.S. that there would be some pricing that would be taken.
So, as we're looking at the tariff going away, we're now also re-evaluating what those pricing assumptions should look like with regard to our Roadmaster brand here in the U.S. In addition, there will be presumably additional competition in the market, as we're not the only one that will benefit from that tariff going away, and so we're assessing that.
And then frankly, as we're evaluating the overall, not just TBR, but the overall volume and pricing and raw material environment, we've chosen to be a little bit conservative about the way that we're looking at the second half of the year in terms of the guidance. Because on a net basis, that tariff change is a benefit for us, but we're looking at it a little bit more cautiously right now, given what we've seen happen in the first and the second quarter.
Ginger M. Jones - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Yeah. And Brett, I would add also the other thing that wasn't known when we set that guidance originally was, obviously, the positive benefit of the tariff but also the negative impact of the tornado. So, that we should also factor in as you think about one-time both positive and negatives for the year.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
And then just as I think about their margin in sequentially here, I mean, adjusting for some of the unusual items, your operating margin is kind of around 7% or something along those lines. To get into that low 8s percent or get into the 8s percent or something like that, you're obviously expecting some margin expansion into the second quarter and then kind of well above the 10% range to kind of average out of around 10% for the full year. Is that – generally my understanding, and more importantly, is that primarily – it sounds like primarily, pricing is going to be the major driver of that improvement going forward?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
I'm not sure I'd put the adjectives on. We didn't use the adjective you used. But, yes, we're expecting our margins to improve as we go into the second quarter, and that clearly is driven by a stabilization of the raw materials and having the full effect of a price increase that we just implemented in March through three months of the second quarter. But there are other things that are going on. As I mentioned earlier, we do have cost reduction initiatives in place.

We are expecting to see a continuation in the growth of volume in markets outside of the U.S. or North America, and that will have some margin improvement along with it in terms of its overall contribution. And we are expecting, we did indicate that we're seeing an improvement and we're expecting an improvement in the U.S. volumes. So, all of those things are going to contribute. And I missed one. We continue to see improvements in mix as well, both in terms of just overall product mix, but also in terms of specifically those HVA categories that we've referred to.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Excellent. Thank you very much, Brad. Thank you, Ginger.

Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I noted in the press release that you mentioned that raw material costs are expected to increase modestly in the second quarter before then stabilizing throughout the balance of the year. Are you referring there to what you recognize in your P&L or to spot prices? I ask because it seems like from some of the metrics that we're able to track that natural rubber and butadiene have declined in April, and I'm just trying to understand if your margin guidance assumes that raw material prices do not decline from their highs.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, the first part of the question, Ryan, it is our index. It isn't necessarily precisely what you see flow through our cost of goods sold for raw materials, but we think that it's directionally a good indicator of what you should see. And as we indicated in the discussion earlier, sequentially, that raw material index increased January, February, and March. We're looking at the same data that you are looking at, in terms of some of the commodity prices out there, and then the timing of when that is going to end up affecting that raw material index is a little bit of a factor in this. But we are seeing the same thing that you're seeing.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then it seems like you lost significant share in March, right, in the U.S. after you increased your prices, but competitors announced increases that would take effect later, I guess, kind of creating their own sort of pre-values (44:27).
In surveying what increases have been announced by whom, it appears that some increases did take place on April 1 just after the quarter closed, and that some others will take place next week on May 1. So, the question is did your share already start to recover after the April 1 increases, and that's kind of what's giving you the confidence that your volume performance will improve relative to the industry as the year progresses, or are you still waiting to see recovery in share until more of the competitor hikes are implemented?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, we don't have complete data right now. What we do have visibility to is our order patterns so far in the month of April, and that's what, in large part, what we're basing our statement on in terms of we've seen an improvement order activity, and that we think that we're going to improve our performance relative to the industry. That is with some – with a necessity that we think a little bit about what the industry is going to look like for the second quarter, but we don't have full details yet. But it does – again, what we're seeing right now is improved from what we were seeing, and that's with most of the increases in and not all of them yet in.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last question from me on manufacturing costs and overhead. I mean, manufacturing at least was a $10 million headwind in the quarter. How should we think about the production costs that you implemented in 1Q impacting overhead absorption going forward? Is there anything we need to be mindful of about the second quarter or anything like that?

Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, we are going to continue to make sure that we don't get into an inventory problem. So, to the extent that we need to adjust our production schedule to ensure that that doesn't happen, we will do that. As we see an improvement in our volumes and as we move into the second half of the year, I would expect that that $10 million will reduce and then not repeat. But again, that will be determined as we go through the year. I would note, and it's a little unfortunate that it's washed out by what we needed to do from a scheduling standpoint, but we are making improvements in our overall manufacturing costs. Unfortunately, they were more than overwhelmed by the days that we took out of the schedule.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Thanks, Ryan. I think we got time, operator, for one more call, so maybe this could be the final call, your final question, excuse me.

Sure. Our last question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
Hey, good morning, this is David Kelley in for Bret. Thanks for squeezing me in here, I'll keep it brief. I guess, if we're isolating the U.S. aftermarket, it sounds like really the entire sector experienced a weaker Q1 largely due to what I think people are attributing it to mild winter weather here. I guess, is that something you observed as well? And are you seeing or expect to see maybe an uptick in U.S. demand in the second quarter, given some of the deferred replacement, and maybe higher miles driven we've seen over the last couple years or so?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Yes, David. What we've said in our comments here is that we do believe it's the overall industry in terms of the sell-out to the end consumer was weaker in the first quarter. That's from some of the information that we have available, and frankly, monitoring comments from others, including in your industry.
And we'll see what happens in the second quarter. There were some factors in the first quarter that may have affected that, that may not be as significant as we move into the second quarter. Overall, when you look at some of the important variables that in the past have been good indicators about what's going to happen with replacement tire volumes like miles driven, like where gas prices are, those things all seem to suggest that there should be some recovery as we look forward over the balance of the year, and we hope to see that. But you're right. In the first quarter, we believe that the industry did see a weaker sell-out environment.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then final word from me. Just a quick high-level question. We've seen significant mix shift in U.S. new vehicle demand, the light trucks and SUVs and kind of away from the passenger cars since 2012. Those vehicles are beginning to roll off warranty and into the aftermarket. Seems like replacement cycles, including tire replacements, beginning to kick in here. Maybe if you could just talk about how you view that opportunity? The product mix shift there over the next several years as we see that ramp up in mix shift?
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Well, you're right, in terms of the tos and fros of the auto industry, clearly the last several years you've seen a recovery in the light truck and the SUV market. We believe, and I think that we'll recognize, we have a very strong product lineup to support that part of the market. It's a place that we have earned, I think, a well-deserved reputation for the products that we provide. And so, I would look to that as being an opportunity for Cooper.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC

All right. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks again for squeezing me in here.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Thanks, David.
Bradley E. Hughes - Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
Okay. With that, I think I'm going to move to my closing remarks. And then first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call with us. We do believe that Cooper is well-positioned to emerge in a strong position from what's going to be a dynamic 2017, as we continue to execute our strategic plan and leverage the strength of our business model. As always, if you've got additional questions or things that you want to dive into a little more deeply, please contact Jerry with any further questions or comments you have. Thanks again.

Keep your car rolling with automotive tires and parts With the right equipment and the proper care, you can keep your car running like new for many years. Walmart carries the tires, oils, fluids and auto parts and accessories you need to stay on the road without worry. Plus, auto tools make it easy to find the right products for your car. With Walmart's convenient, affordable auto services, you can get your car serviced while you shop. Car and truck tires If you're looking for tires for your car or truck, be sure to pick out a set that's right for your vehicle and driving conditions. For the optimal performance at all times, consider buying tires for the worst weather and driving conditions you're likely to encounter in a specific season, and use Walmart's Tire Finder to select the right size for your vehicle. It's a good idea to get multiple sets of tires for different seasons if you live in an area with extreme weather conditions. Winter tires Winter tires are made with a softer compound and feature more rubber than summer tires. They need to stay soft and flexible so they can grip the road better, even in colder conditions. When the temperature hits 44 degrees Fahrenheit, summer and all-season tires become hard and lose their effectiveness. Look for winter tires for better traction and safer handling in the cold months. Lawn and tractor tires When it comes to lawn and tractor tires, there are three main kinds to choose from: Turf tires are the least aggressive of the three styles and are meant primarily for mowing your yard. Worksite (also known as R4) tires are used on hard surfaces like asphalt, concrete and gravel. They're a bit wider so they distribute the weight they re carrying more evenly, which means less stress on the tire but also less traction. They're best used in dry conditions. Agriculture tires are the most aggressive of the three, providing better traction for soft fields and loose dirt. They're recommended for working in the snow, mud and general farm use. Trailer tires Trailer tires aren't like car and truck tires. They don t need to be steered and aren't connected to complex suspension, steering and braking systems. Don t use car and truck tires on a trailer; it s a safety hazard. Instead, look for Special Trailer (ST) tires. They provide a heavy-duty load capacity, and the stiff sidewalls help to prevent your vehicle from swaying. Also, they re designed for trailer wheels, which are typically narrower than the wheels on a car. ATV tires The first step to choosing the right ATV tire is knowing the type of terrain you'll be riding on. All-purpose tires are good for year-round riding in "non-extreme" conditions. If you re going to be riding around in yards and woods and other normal terrain, this is the tire for you. Sand tires are probably the most recognizable ATV tires. The rear tires look like paddles and the front tires provide a rib down the middles or sides to assist with steering. You won t get far on the sand without these. Mud tires have deep, thick lugs to offer traction and support in extreme mud conditions. There are also motocross tires, offering traction and speed for dirt race tracks with jumps. Off-road tires are great for everything from mountainous terrain to racing across a wide-open desert. Golf cart tires If you have your own golf cart, you'll eventually need to get new tires, especially if you play a lot of golf. Modern golf cart tires are tubeless and come in a variety of sizes and tread patterns. Standard golf cart tires measure 18 inches tall (outer diameter) by 8.5 inches wide (across the tread) by 8 inches at the bead (inner diameter). They're designated as NHS, which means "non-highway service," and aren't designed to withstand heavy loads or high speeds. Tire accessories Walmart makes it easy to shop for motor oil, transmission fluid and car lubricants too. When choosing motor oil, be sure to consult your car's owner's manual for specifications and choose the best viscosity for your conditions. Low-viscosity oil is good for easier starts in cold weather, while high-viscosity oil is good for higher temperatures and maintaining proper oil pressure under loads. Walmart also carries car batteries, replacement parts, interior and exterior car accessories, and everything you need for auto detailing and car care, from auto paint to car wax and polish. Be sure to shop for car safety and security devices for that extra peace of mind. Save money.

When your car's battery is old, drained or otherwise not working properly, you may experience problems ranging from a sluggish engine start to leaking battery acid or a "check engine" light on your dashboard. Whether you're performing routine maintenance or trying to quickly solve an unexpected battery problem, Walmart has the supplies you need to get the job done at Every Day Low Prices. Walmart's automotive department offers a variety of car battery options in different sizes and voltages in addition to useful battery-related accessories such as portable battery chargers, jumper cables and charging system monitors. Many of the batteries and accessories are available with free two-day shipping or same-day in-store pickup so you can quickly get your car or truck back up and running. Other options Car and truck batteries aren't the only vehicle battery options available. You can a find a variety of battery options for other vehicles, adding convenience and efficiency to your shopping experience. You don't have to look anywhere else for your vehicle battery shopping needs. Marine batteries: From small motor boats to large yachts, we offer batteries that can suit a large variety of boat types and sizes in a range of different voltages, amperages and dimensions. We also offer both lead acid and lithium-ion marine batteries, giving you the ability to choose just the right replacement for your boat. Some of these batteries are also designed for crossover use with recreational vehicles (RV). Lawn and garden batteries: Though they usually aren't as large as a car battery, lawnmowers and other lawn equipment have batteries that need to be replaced periodically. Our assortment of lawn and garden batteries includes those for both riding and walking electric lawn mowers. Batteries come from a range of different manufacturers, including Snapper, Black & Decker, Sears, Yard Man and Toro. Power sport batteries: Motorcycles, scooters, ATVs and snowmobiles need batteries, too, and we've got a great selection of batteries that are specially made for these power sport vehicles. Find replacement batteries for power sport vehicles made by brands including Yamaha, Honda and Harley-Davidson in this department. Other batteries: Walmart also offers assorted batteries for vehicles and motorized electronic devices not listed above. From wheelchairs to kids' toy ride-on cars, we offer the same convenient in-store or home-delivery service for these assorted specialty batteries as we do for all our other battery options in the Car Batteries department. Replacing your car battery In most cases, a car battery should be properly disposed of and replaced with a brand-new battery after three years of use. If your battery is three years old or older and you're experiencing issues like sluggish engine ignition or a complete electrical failure caused by a dead battery, it's worth it to simply replace the old model rather than trying to jump start or charge. In some cases, your car's battery may need to be replaced sooner. For example, if your battery is being drained by a faulty electrical component in the car's audio system, that could lead to the need for early replacement. Multimeters and other battery testers can tell you when your battery is nearing the end of its lifespan, but you can also err on the side of caution and opt for replacement if you know your battery is nearing the three year mark or if you have some sort of electrical system issue that's causing a drain. Recommended replacement times for other vehicle battery types may vary. Battery selection assistance While you can often determine what kind of battery to buy for your vehicle by looking at what's currently under the hood, that's not always sufficient. If you aren't sure what kind of replacement battery you need for a given car, truck, lawnmower, boat or power sport vehicle, Walmart offers assistance both online and in store. Our online Walmart Battery Finder tool allows you to input information like vehicle type, make, model and engine type to determine the right battery match for your needs. It's a simple way to ensure you don't accidentally pick out the wrong battery, which can actually be dangerous to install.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349566, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Tire Stickers Cooper Tire Lettering Kit - White - 4 of Each: 1.25 inch tall Temporary Peel & ...



                    If you are looking to determine what design is best for your vehicle or have an upcoming photo shoot, race or event, Peel and Stick is the affordable Tire Lettering solution for you. This short-term product is quick and easy to apply and ideal for short to medium term durability, specifically under                    
                     1,000 miles of driving.To avoid damaging your Tire Stickers, it is important the correct letter height for your tire is ordered. There are two methods of determining the proper fitment for your tire:1. Measure the sidewall surface with a ruler - Be sure to measure the sidewall, NOT the entire surface from tread to wheel.2. Generic Tire Sizing guidelines - Identify the aspect ratio or series (generally the middle number of the tire specification) and match it to the generic tire sizing guide below to determine your letter height. Tire Series Specification          MAX Recommended Letter Height                   20                                                   0.5                   25                                                   0.75                   30                                                   1.0                   35                                                   1.25                   40                                                   1.25                   45                                                   1.5                   50                                                   1.75                   55                                                   2.0When in doubt, it is safest to size the same height as the tire manufacturer's brand letters.  Anything larger may risk damage in cornering or standard driving conditions.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
