Meet Dr. Alexander



	I love orthodontics because it changes lives. Words cannot describe how wonderful it feels to create a beautiful and healthy smile for someone that had previously avoided smiling because of embarrassment. Witnessing a patient’s newfound self-confidence and incredible joy when they first see their new smile, is rewarding and humbling. To be able to bring such a transformation to a person’s life, to make a positive change that will last for a lifetime, is what orthodontics is all about.

	My father, who was a dentist for more than 40 years, gave me some very good advice as I was starting my career. He said, “Don’t make patients out of your friends; make friends out of your patients.” He was right. I genuinely enjoy getting to know my patients and becoming their friend as much as their orthodontist. I look forward to their visits as a time to catch up on their latest news, share a few stories, and laugh at their jokes. No wonder I look forward to coming into the practice each morning!

	I am truly blessed to have a profession where I can help people.

	My Education and Commitment to Furthering My Knowledge

	I received my Doctorate of Dental Surgery from the University of California at San Francisco and completed my orthodontic specialty certificate and Master of Science there, as well. Since graduation, I have actively pursued continuing education courses at every opportunity.

	Oral healthcare is an ever-evolving field, with new technologies being developed and honed, and new treatment methodologies being established. It is my responsibility as an orthodontist to stay on the leading edge of this knowledge, in order to provide my patients with the strongest, most proven treatment options. They deserve nothing less.

	I have been a certified Invisalign® provider for more than 10 years now. During that time, Invisalign has evolved and I am excited about the role that the treatment will continue to play in orthodontia. I have made Invisalign a focus of my continuing education, and spent hundreds of hours in courses all over the country, to refine my technical skills.

	I’m a proud Sacramento native and have called Rocklin my home since 2001. My wife Robyn and I were high school sweethearts and we’ve been married for more than 20 years. We have six children: five sons and a daughter. Most of my leisure time is spent being a dad. I attend a lot of sporting events and musicals in which my children participate. I also enjoy the outdoors, and when I can combine being outside and time with my family, I am happiest.

	My mother was an avid gardener and passed that passion along to me. I find tending to plants to be very relaxing and I love to create wonderful dishes with what I grow.

R. McNeill Alexander
CBE FRS





Died
21 March 2016 


Robert McNeill (Neill) Alexander, CBE FRS[1] (7 July 1934 – 21 March 2016) was a British zoologist[2][3][4] and a leading authority in the field of biomechanics. Until 1970, he was mainly concerned with fish, investigating the mechanics of swim bladders, tails and fish jaw mechanisms. Subsequently, he concentrated on the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion, notably walking and running in mammals, particularly on gait selection and its relationship to anatomy and to the structural design of skeletons and muscles.[1]

Education and early life[edit]
Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Alexander was educated at the University of Cambridge (MA, PhD)[5] and the University of Wales (DSc).[4] His PhD research was supervised by James Gray.[2]
Career and research[edit]
After holding a lectureship at University College of North Wales from 1958 to 1969, he was Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds from 1969 until his retirement in 1999, when the title of emeritus professor was conferred upon him.[6]
Alexander was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1992–1999) which included supervising the management of London and Whipsnade Zoos. He was president of the Society for Experimental Biology (1995–1997), President of the International Society of Vertebrate Morphologists (1997–2001) and editor of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B (1998–2004).[7] Alexander specialised in research on animal mechanics and published numerous books and research papers in the field from 1959.
Dinosaur locomotion[edit]
Alexander was particularly interested in the mechanics of dinosaur motion.[8] He developed a formula to calculate the speed of motion of dinosaurs, the so-called 'dinosaur speed calculator,' mathematically derived from the Froude number:



"The key to deriving estimates of dinosaur gait and speed from trackways was provided by the zoologist R. McNeill Alexander (1976). From observations of modern animals he derived a general relationship between an animal's speed of locomotion (v) and its hip height (h) and its stride length (SL), which is























v

=
0.25.


g

−
0.5



.

S

L

1.67



.


h

−
1.17





{\displaystyle {v}=0.25.{g^{-0.5}}.{SL^{1.67}}.{h^{-1.17}}}




















Alexander also pointed out that this formula could be applied to dinosaur trackways since the stride length can be measured directly and the hip height could be estimated from the size of the foot print."[9]



Originally, Alexander stated: "I have now obtained a relationship between speed, stride length and body size from observations of living animals and applied this to dinosaurs to achieve estimates of their speeds. The estimated speeds are rather low—between 1.0 and 3.6 ms−1."[10]
Modifications to the original formula gave rise to revised estimates, and "Alexander (1996) argued that based on the bone dimensions of Tyrannosaurus it is unlikely they could have travelled at more than 8ms−1."[11] Several calculations using variants of the formula indicate that dinosaurs probably travelled at around 3 ms−1 with a top speed of 8 ms−1. This translates to a speed range of roughly 6–20 mph.

Subsequently, he concentrated on the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion, notably walking and running in mammals, particularly on gait selection and its relationship to anatomy and to the structural design of skeletons and muscles.[1]

Education and early life[edit]
Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Alexander was educated at the University of Cambridge (MA, PhD)[5] and the University of Wales (DSc).[4] His PhD research was supervised by James Gray.[2]
Career and research[edit]
After holding a lectureship at University College of North Wales from 1958 to 1969, he was Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds from 1969 until his retirement in 1999, when the title of emeritus professor was conferred upon him.[6]
Alexander was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1992–1999) which included supervising the management of London and Whipsnade Zoos. He was president of the Society for Experimental Biology (1995–1997), President of the International Society of Vertebrate Morphologists (1997–2001) and editor of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B (1998–2004).[7] Alexander specialised in research on animal mechanics and published numerous books and research papers in the field from 1959.
Dinosaur locomotion[edit]
Alexander was particularly interested in the mechanics of dinosaur motion.[8] He developed a formula to calculate the speed of motion of dinosaurs, the so-called 'dinosaur speed calculator,' mathematically derived from the Froude number:



"The key to deriving estimates of dinosaur gait and speed from trackways was provided by the zoologist R. McNeill Alexander (1976). From observations of modern animals he derived a general relationship between an animal's speed of locomotion (v) and its hip height (h) and its stride length (SL), which is























v

=
0.25.


g

−
0.5



.

S

L

1.67



.


h

−
1.17





{\displaystyle {v}=0.25.{g^{-0.5}}.{SL^{1.67}}.{h^{-1.17}}}




















Alexander also pointed out that this formula could be applied to dinosaur trackways since the stride length can be measured directly and the hip height could be estimated from the size of the foot print."[9]



Originally, Alexander stated: "I have now obtained a relationship between speed, stride length and body size from observations of living animals and applied this to dinosaurs to achieve estimates of their speeds. The estimated speeds are rather low—between 1.0 and 3.6 ms−1."[10]
Modifications to the original formula gave rise to revised estimates, and "Alexander (1996) argued that based on the bone dimensions of Tyrannosaurus it is unlikely they could have travelled at more than 8ms−1."[11] Several calculations using variants of the formula indicate that dinosaurs probably travelled at around 3 ms−1 with a top speed of 8 ms−1. This translates to a speed range of roughly 6–20 mph.

Originally, Alexander stated: "I have now obtained a relationship between speed, stride length and body size from observations of living animals and applied this to dinosaurs to achieve estimates of their speeds. The estimated speeds are rather low—between 1.0 and 3.6 ms−1."[10]
Modifications to the original formula gave rise to revised estimates, and "Alexander (1996) argued that based on the bone dimensions of Tyrannosaurus it is unlikely they could have travelled at more than 8ms−1."[11] Several calculations using variants of the formula indicate that dinosaurs probably travelled at around 3 ms−1 with a top speed of 8 ms−1. This translates to a speed range of roughly 6–20 mph.

R. McNeill Alexander
CBE FRS





Died
21 March 2016 


Robert McNeill (Neill) Alexander, CBE FRS[1] (7 July 1934 – 21 March 2016) was a British zoologist[2][3][4] and a leading authority in the field of biomechanics. Until 1970, he was mainly concerned with fish, investigating the mechanics of swim bladders, tails and fish jaw mechanisms. Subsequently, he concentrated on the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion, notably walking and running in mammals, particularly on gait selection and its relationship to anatomy and to the structural design of skeletons and muscles.[1]

Education and early life[edit]
Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Alexander was educated at the University of Cambridge (MA, PhD)[5] and the University of Wales (DSc).[4] His PhD research was supervised by James Gray.[2]
Career and research[edit]
After holding a lectureship at University College of North Wales from 1958 to 1969, he was Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds from 1969 until his retirement in 1999, when the title of emeritus professor was conferred upon him.[6]
Alexander was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1992–1999) which included supervising the management of London and Whipsnade Zoos. He was president of the Society for Experimental Biology (1995–1997), President of the International Society of Vertebrate Morphologists (1997–2001) and editor of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B (1998–2004).[7] Alexander specialised in research on animal mechanics and published numerous books and research papers in the field from 1959.
Dinosaur locomotion[edit]
Alexander was particularly interested in the mechanics of dinosaur motion.[8] He developed a formula to calculate the speed of motion of dinosaurs, the so-called 'dinosaur speed calculator,' mathematically derived from the Froude number:



"The key to deriving estimates of dinosaur gait and speed from trackways was provided by the zoologist R. McNeill Alexander (1976). From observations of modern animals he derived a general relationship between an animal's speed of locomotion (v) and its hip height (h) and its stride length (SL), which is























v

=
0.25.


g

−
0.5



.

S

L

1.67



.


h

−
1.17





{\displaystyle {v}=0.25.{g^{-0.5}}.{SL^{1.67}}.{h^{-1.17}}}




















Alexander also pointed out that this formula could be applied to dinosaur trackways since the stride length can be measured directly and the hip height could be estimated from the size of the foot print."[9]



Originally, Alexander stated: "I have now obtained a relationship between speed, stride length and body size from observations of living animals and applied this to dinosaurs to achieve estimates of their speeds. The estimated speeds are rather low—between 1.0 and 3.6 ms−1."[10]
Modifications to the original formula gave rise to revised estimates, and "Alexander (1996) argued that based on the bone dimensions of Tyrannosaurus it is unlikely they could have travelled at more than 8ms−1."[11] Several calculations using variants of the formula indicate that dinosaurs probably travelled at around 3 ms−1 with a top speed of 8 ms−1. This translates to a speed range of roughly 6–20 mph.
