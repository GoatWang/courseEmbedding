Investment Management  


The Portfolio Approach
A portfolio is commonly defined by the Free Dictionary as a “range of investments held by a person or organization”.  More specifically, we believe that range should be a basket of diverse underlying investments providing different sources of risk and return that, when combined, provide the investor an appropriate asset allocation.  Grimes & Company combines traditional long term investment approaches and cutting edge trading strategies to create customized, client-specific investment solutions.
	Our mission is to provide each client with an investment experience designed to meet their unique financial objectives via strong performance, disciplined asset management and unparalleled service. Each client situation is analyzed with respect to risk tolerance, time horizon, cash flow needs, tax sensitivity, and other client-specific parameters. An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) outlining those goals and parameters is created for each client before the investment management process begins.
	The real value added by Grimes & Company is active investment managementand proprietary strategies that are managed in-house and not outsourced to third parties with added opaqueness and multiple layers of expense. Investment management is a combination of analysis and decision making.  Unlike many firms, we do not outsource the money management functions of our business because we feel that the IPS and Investment Management process are intertwined and should not be separated. Research is performed internally using proprietary macroeconomic rankings, valuation models and company rating systems. Portfolios are customized based on the specific needs and goals of the individual client.

Important Disclosure
 


 




Our History  


Our company dates back to 1985 when it was founded by Timothy J. Grimes.
In the early days, there were few truly independent wealth management firms, and most investment advice was given by commission-based representatives of large regional and national firms. Even then, Tim had a vision of providing objective, customized advice and guidance on a fee basis to eliminate the conflict of interest that can sometimes exist with commissionable products.
In many ways, Tim was a pioneer in the industry. He recognized the value in becoming a CFP® Practitioner (Certified Financial Planner), and earned the designation early in his career. He was also an early adaptor of the discretionary, fee based asset management model that has become an industry standard today.
Kevin T. Grimes, CFA, CFP® joined his father in 1998 and soon began building out the firm’s infrastructure, with a heavy emphasis on investment management. Kevin’s primary focus has been leading the Investment Committee and serving as Chief Investment Officer. In this capacity, he and his team created several successful, proprietary investment strategies, and they continue to cultivate new ideas to continuously offer clients a dynamic suite of investment solutions.
In 2015, Kevin stepped into the role of President, and Tim graduated to the title of Founder and Chairman. As President, Kevin’s focus is the strategic vision of the firm, effectively managing the talented teams, and continuing to thoughtfully grow the firm.
The firm originally started as a family business, and there are still four family members involved today. But what started as a sole proprietorship over thirty years ago has evolved into the firm it is today, with discretionary assets under management of over $1.7 billion, over thirty employees, and clients across the country.
The Grimes family is one that identifies with the ocean and has multigenerational roots to Cape Cod. The lighthouse in the Grimes & Company logo is reminiscent of the firm’s early days. Before voicemail, everyone in the office had a lighthouse figurine, and the receptionist would leave messages under the lighthouse. But the image is more than that; it represents the firm’s investment philosophy of trying to minimize risk while serving as a trusted guide to clients through both good and bad times.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
