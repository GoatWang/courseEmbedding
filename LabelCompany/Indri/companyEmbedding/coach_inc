About COACH, INC.


   Coach is riding in style, thanks to the company's leather items and some savvy licensing deals. The company designs and makes (mostly through third parties) high-end leather goods and accessories, including handbags, wallets, and luggage. Founded in 1941, Coach also licenses its name for watches, eyewear, fragrances, scarves, and footwear. The luxury brand sells its wares through more than 1,000 department and outlet stores (in the US and more than 45 other countries), catalogs, and its website. Macy's, Nordstrom, Saks, and others carry Coach items. It also runs more than 1,000 retail and factory outlet stores in North America, Japan, and China. The company acquired luxury shoe maker Stuart Weitzman Holdings in 2015.
  
Operations

   The company operates three segments: North America, International, and Stuart Weitzman.
  

   The North America segment, which represents over 50% of company revenue, includes sales to North American consumers through its retail stores, factory stores, Internet, and wholesale.
  

   Its International segment, which consists primarily of sales to consumers through company-operated stores in Japan and mainland China, also accounts for revenue from Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Korea, and e-commerce sales to those territories. Wholesale customers and distributors in approximately 35 countries also contribute to the segment's sales. The segment represents about 40% of sales.
  

   The Stuart Weitzman segment consists of global sales of the Stuart Weitzman brand, acquired in 2015, and represents the remaining revenue.
  
Geographic Reach

   Coach operates some 250 retail stores and about 195 factory stores in the US; some 40 retail stores and 11 factory stores in Canada; about 195 department store shop-in-shops, retail stores, and factory stores in Japan; and nearly 185 department store shop-in-shops, retail stores, and factory stores in Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Korea. It also sells to wholesale customers and distributors in some 45 countries.
  

   Coach also operates distribution, product development, and quality control locations in the US, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. The handbag maker generates over half its revenue from the US, while China and Japan account for about 15% and 12%.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company's creative marketing, visual merchandising, and public relations teams maintain the Coach New York-style image. Coach leverages its consumer and market research capabilities to assess consumer attitudes and trends. As part of Coach's direct marketing strategy, it taps a growing database of some 28 million active households in North America and 11 million active households in Asia. To spur purchases and build brand awareness, the company communicates with customers through some 1.2 billion emails and millions of catalogs worldwide. It's looking to boost e-commerce sales through its digital strategy, coach.com, global e-commerce sites and programs, third-party flash sites, marketing sites, and social networking. Coach boasts 22 marketing websites in 23 countries.
  

   Coach's advertising costs span direct marketing activities, such as direct mail pieces, media, and production costs. These expenses have increased substantially in each of the past three years. Ad costs reached $202 million in fiscal 2016, up from about $161 million in 2015 and $130 million in 2014.
  

   The company's products are sold through more than 1,000 wholesale locations in the US and Canada. Top US wholesale customers include Macy's (including Bloomingdale's), Dillard's, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor, The Bay, Bon Ton, Belk, and Von Maur.
  

   Coach operates an 850,000 sq. ft. distribution and consumer service facility in Jacksonville, Florida, which uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system. Coach's distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes. This allows them to more accurately process and pack orders, track shipments, and manage inventory. Coach's products are primarily shipped to Coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers, and direct to consumers via express delivery providers.
  

   To support its growth in the Asia/Pacific region, Coach operates distribution centers, through third-parties, in China, Hong Kong, Japan,  Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Taiwan.
  
Financial Performance

   After two difficult years, Coach has seen a return to top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2016. Net sales increased 7.2% to $4.5 billion due to the first full-year inclusion of the acquired Stuart Weitzman brand (it recorded just two months of sales in the previous fiscal year). Growth of $82 million in Coach's international business was entirely offset by declines in its North America and Other segments.
  

   Profitability nosed up 11% to $460 million, with higher net sales countered to an extent by higher SGA costs, particularly pertaining to higher advertising spend. Cash from operating activities was 20% lower than in fiscal 2015, at $758 million.
  
Strategy

   Coach launched what it called a Transformation Plan in the latter part of its 2014 fiscal year. The plan calls for closing a number of stores, opening a number of stores pitched to the higher end, refocusing on higher end products, and scaling back its promotional activities.
  

   The company has closed 70 of its North American stores and opened a few concept stores(12 in North America and eight overseas) in select markets. The company also is banking on growth in China. In 2015 its sales grew about 9% in China, where Coach helps meet the desire for Western designer brands. The company is also thing to take better control of its inventory. The closer its supply meets demand, the less Coach will have to offer discounts to move product.
  

   With the purchase of Stuart Weitzman, Coach hopes to extend its brand from handbags and accessories to include footwear and ready-to-wear.
  

   The plan includes spending $50 million on advertising to raise the consumer perception of the Coach brand.
  

   Coach is facing increased competition from fast-growing rivals, such as Kate Spade and Michael Kors.
  

   The leather goods maker has been looking at global markets to diversify. Coach is pushing to penetrate the European luxury goods market, helped by an exclusive arrangement with Printemps, the French department store chain, and in Spain with El Corte Inglés. It is also eyeing Germany, Italy, Brazil, and India. In Asia, Coach sees China as one of its largest opportunity and is adding new locations in the country. Its Japanese business is where the company counts on its trendy target audience. Coach anticipates an ultimate market penetration of up to 180 stores.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions
In 2017 Coach agreed to acquire luxury apparel and accessories designer Kate Spade & Co. for $2.4 billion. Upon completion, the deal would expand Coach's handbag and accessories portfolio to include a more diverse set of products and brands. 
To boost its efforts to become a lifestyle brand, Coach in 2015 bought women's luxury shoemaker Stuart Weitzman Holdings for about $530 million. The shoe company had annual revenue of about $300 million.

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWCOH » Topics » ManufacturingThis excerpt taken from the COH 10-K filed Aug 19, 2009.Manufacturing 
All of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers. However, we maintain control of the supply chain from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing and product development offices in Hong Kong, China, South Korea and India that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. Over the last several years, we have increased the presence of our senior management at the manufacturers facilities to enhance control over decision
making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized. 
These independent manufacturers support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. During fiscal 2009, approximately 72% of Coachs total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year. As the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations, our production quantities are limited which lowers our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory. 
All product sources, including independent manufacturers and licensing partners, must achieve and maintain Coachs high quality standards, which are an integral part of the Coach identity. One of Coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although Coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities. 
Coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of better brand partners with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. Our manufacturers are located in many countries, including China, Italy, United States, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Philippines, Ecuador, Malaysia, Mauritius, Peru, Spain and Taiwan. Coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. No one vendor currently provides more than approximately 10% of Coachs total units. Before
partnering with a vendor, Coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis. We believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with Coachs integrity standards.

Coach has refined its production capabilities in
coordination with the repositioning of its brand. By shifting
its production from owned domestic facilities to independent
manufacturers in lower-cost markets, it can support a broader
mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new,
more fashion-oriented styles. During fiscal year 2004,
approximately 61% of Coachs total net sales, excluding
Coach Japan, were generated from products introduced within the
fiscal year. At the same time, we help manage total inventory
and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory by
designating a significant number of the new styles as
limited editions that are planned to be offered for
a brief time and then replaced with fresh new products.

Coach has developed a flexible model that meets
shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer
preferences. It uses two main sources to make Coach products:
outsourcing with skilled partners and production by its
licensing partners. All product sources must achieve and
maintain Coachs high quality standards, which are an
integral part of the Coach identity. One of Coachs keys to
success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach
has long-standing relationships with purveyors of fine leathers
and hardware. As it has moved its production to external
sources, Coach still requires that these same raw materials are
used in all of its products, wherever they are made. We monitor
compliance with the quality control standards through on-site
quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities.

     
All of Coachs fiscal year 2004 product
requirements were supplied by independent manufacturers. Coach
buys independently manufactured products from many countries,
including China, Turkey, India, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,
Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Spain,
Taiwan and Thailand. Coach operates sourcing offices in
Hong Kong, China and South Korea that work closely
with our sourced vendors. Coach also operates a European
sourcing and product development organization based in Florence,
Italy that works closely with the New York design team. This
broad-based multi-country manufacturing strategy is designed to
optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction
capabilities. Coach carefully balances its commitments to a

History[edit]
1946-1985[edit]




190 Post St in San Francisco, CA






King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA


Coach was founded in 1941, as a family-run workshop in a loft on 34th Street in Manhattan,[8][9] with six leatherworkers who made wallets and billfolds by hand.[10]
In 1946, Miles Cahn and his wife Lillian joined the company.[11] Miles and Lillian Cahn were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business, and were knowledgeable about leatherworks and business.[10]
By 1950, Cahn had taken over the business. During the early years, Cahn noticed the distinctive properties and qualities of the leather used to make baseball gloves. With wear and use, the leather in a glove became softer and suppler. Attempting to mimic this process, Cahn made a way of processing the leather to make it stronger, softer, and more flexible. Since the leather absorbed dye very well, this process also created a richer, deeper color in the leather.[12] Soon after Cahn developed this new process, Lillian Cahn suggested to Miles that the company supplement the factory's men's accessories business by adding women's leather handbags.[10] The "sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit."[10]
Miles and Lillian Cahn bought the company through a leveraged buyout in 1961.[10]
In 1961, Cahn hired Bonnie Cashin, a sportswear pioneer, to design handbags for Coach.[10] Cashin "revolutionized the product's design," working as creative head for Coach from 1962 through 1974.[10]
Cashin instituted the inclusion of side pockets, coin purses, and brighter colors (as opposed to the usual hues of browns and tans) in the products.[10] Cashin also designed matching shoes, pens, key fobs, and eyewear,[10] and added hardware to both her clothes and accessories–particularly the silver toggle that became the Coach hallmark–declaring that she had been inspired by a memory of quickly fastening the top on her convertible sports car.
In 1979, Lewis Frankfort joined the company as vice-president of business development. During this time, Coach was making $6 million in sales and products were being distributed through the domestic wholesale channel, primarily in the northeastern United States.[11] He was mentored by the then executive VP of sales, Richard Rose. Richard joined Coach in 1965, and he is credited with making Coach a household name after putting the product in department stores across the United States and abroad. He retired from his position in the company in 1995.
In 1981, under Frankfort's leadership, the company opened its first directly operated retail location on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.[13]
1985: Sale to Sara Lee[edit]
In 1985, the Cahns decided to sell Coach Leatherware after determining they wanted to "devote more time to their growing goat farm and cheese production business called Coach Farm in Gallatinville, New York, which they began in 1983".[10] Coach was then sold to Sara Lee Corporation for a reported $30 million.[10] Lew Frankfort succeeded Cahn as president.[10]
Sara Lee structured Coach under its Hanes Group.[10] In early 1986, new boutiques were opened in Macy's stores in New York City and San Francisco. Additional Coach stores were under construction, and similar boutiques were to be opened in other major department stores later that year. By November 1986, the company was operating 12 stores, along with nearly 50 boutiques within larger department stores.
Sara Lee Corporation divested itself of Coach first, by selling 19.5% of their shares of Coach at the Coach IPO in October 2000, followed in April 2001, with the distribution of their remaining shares to Sara Lee’s stockholders through an exchange offer.[14]
1996: Reed Krakoff leads design[edit]
In 1996, Lew Frankfort was named chairman and CEO of Coach. The following year, under Frankfort's leadership, Coach hired Reed Krakoff, whose creative and commercials instincts aimed to make Coach products functional, lightweight, and stylish.[8] Krakoff's design transformed Coach from the relatively small company that it was in 1985 into the worldwide-known brand that it is today.[8][15]
2013–present[edit]
In February 2013, Coach named Victor Luis president and chief commercial officer and announced that he would become chief executive officer in January 2014, with Lew Frankfort continuing as executive chairman.[16] In 2013, Coach generated $5 billion in sales and operated approximately 1,000 directly operated locations globally, including North America, Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Europe.[2]
In 2014, the company announced Stuart Vevers as the new executive creative director, replacing Reed Krakoff.[17]
During 2014, Coach also announced that Lew Frankfort would retire as executive chairman at the expiration of his term in November 2014.[18]
In January 2015, Coach agreed to buy shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for up to $574 million in cash.[19] In the same year, Coach also launched Coach 1941, "a new, higher-priced line centered on ready-to-wear." [20]
Coach marked its 75th anniversary in 2016 with the announcement of its partnership with Selena Gomez.[21][22]
In May 2017 it was announced that Coach was ready to purchase Kate Spade for $2.4 billion.[23] Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. had previously expressed interest in buying Kate Spade.[24]

"Coach's Women's Initiative explores the best opportunities to help women fully realize their potential by supporting programs that encourage personal and economic empowerment.
Coach's Education Initiative focuses on improving educational opportunities for the underserved, to provide everyone with the opportunity to learn, grow and meaningfully contribute to our society."[33]

History[edit]
1946-1985[edit]




190 Post St in San Francisco, CA






King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA


Coach was founded in 1941, as a family-run workshop in a loft on 34th Street in Manhattan,[8][9] with six leatherworkers who made wallets and billfolds by hand.[10]
In 1946, Miles Cahn and his wife Lillian joined the company.[11] Miles and Lillian Cahn were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business, and were knowledgeable about leatherworks and business.[10]
By 1950, Cahn had taken over the business. During the early years, Cahn noticed the distinctive properties and qualities of the leather used to make baseball gloves. With wear and use, the leather in a glove became softer and suppler. Attempting to mimic this process, Cahn made a way of processing the leather to make it stronger, softer, and more flexible. Since the leather absorbed dye very well, this process also created a richer, deeper color in the leather.[12] Soon after Cahn developed this new process, Lillian Cahn suggested to Miles that the company supplement the factory's men's accessories business by adding women's leather handbags.[10] The "sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit."[10]
Miles and Lillian Cahn bought the company through a leveraged buyout in 1961.[10]
In 1961, Cahn hired Bonnie Cashin, a sportswear pioneer, to design handbags for Coach.[10] Cashin "revolutionized the product's design," working as creative head for Coach from 1962 through 1974.[10]
Cashin instituted the inclusion of side pockets, coin purses, and brighter colors (as opposed to the usual hues of browns and tans) in the products.[10] Cashin also designed matching shoes, pens, key fobs, and eyewear,[10] and added hardware to both her clothes and accessories–particularly the silver toggle that became the Coach hallmark–declaring that she had been inspired by a memory of quickly fastening the top on her convertible sports car.
In 1979, Lewis Frankfort joined the company as vice-president of business development. During this time, Coach was making $6 million in sales and products were being distributed through the domestic wholesale channel, primarily in the northeastern United States.[11] He was mentored by the then executive VP of sales, Richard Rose. Richard joined Coach in 1965, and he is credited with making Coach a household name after putting the product in department stores across the United States and abroad. He retired from his position in the company in 1995.
In 1981, under Frankfort's leadership, the company opened its first directly operated retail location on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.[13]
1985: Sale to Sara Lee[edit]
In 1985, the Cahns decided to sell Coach Leatherware after determining they wanted to "devote more time to their growing goat farm and cheese production business called Coach Farm in Gallatinville, New York, which they began in 1983".[10] Coach was then sold to Sara Lee Corporation for a reported $30 million.[10] Lew Frankfort succeeded Cahn as president.[10]
Sara Lee structured Coach under its Hanes Group.[10] In early 1986, new boutiques were opened in Macy's stores in New York City and San Francisco. Additional Coach stores were under construction, and similar boutiques were to be opened in other major department stores later that year. By November 1986, the company was operating 12 stores, along with nearly 50 boutiques within larger department stores.
Sara Lee Corporation divested itself of Coach first, by selling 19.5% of their shares of Coach at the Coach IPO in October 2000, followed in April 2001, with the distribution of their remaining shares to Sara Lee’s stockholders through an exchange offer.[14]
1996: Reed Krakoff leads design[edit]
In 1996, Lew Frankfort was named chairman and CEO of Coach. The following year, under Frankfort's leadership, Coach hired Reed Krakoff, whose creative and commercials instincts aimed to make Coach products functional, lightweight, and stylish.[8] Krakoff's design transformed Coach from the relatively small company that it was in 1985 into the worldwide-known brand that it is today.[8][15]
2013–present[edit]
In February 2013, Coach named Victor Luis president and chief commercial officer and announced that he would become chief executive officer in January 2014, with Lew Frankfort continuing as executive chairman.[16] In 2013, Coach generated $5 billion in sales and operated approximately 1,000 directly operated locations globally, including North America, Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Europe.[2]
In 2014, the company announced Stuart Vevers as the new executive creative director, replacing Reed Krakoff.[17]
During 2014, Coach also announced that Lew Frankfort would retire as executive chairman at the expiration of his term in November 2014.[18]
In January 2015, Coach agreed to buy shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for up to $574 million in cash.[19] In the same year, Coach also launched Coach 1941, "a new, higher-priced line centered on ready-to-wear." [20]
Coach marked its 75th anniversary in 2016 with the announcement of its partnership with Selena Gomez.[21][22]
In May 2017 it was announced that Coach was ready to purchase Kate Spade for $2.4 billion.[23] Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. had previously expressed interest in buying Kate Spade.[24]

History[edit]
1946-1985[edit]




190 Post St in San Francisco, CA






King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA


Coach was founded in 1941, as a family-run workshop in a loft on 34th Street in Manhattan,[8][9] with six leatherworkers who made wallets and billfolds by hand.[10]
In 1946, Miles Cahn and his wife Lillian joined the company.[11] Miles and Lillian Cahn were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business, and were knowledgeable about leatherworks and business.[10]
By 1950, Cahn had taken over the business. During the early years, Cahn noticed the distinctive properties and qualities of the leather used to make baseball gloves. With wear and use, the leather in a glove became softer and suppler. Attempting to mimic this process, Cahn made a way of processing the leather to make it stronger, softer, and more flexible. Since the leather absorbed dye very well, this process also created a richer, deeper color in the leather.[12] Soon after Cahn developed this new process, Lillian Cahn suggested to Miles that the company supplement the factory's men's accessories business by adding women's leather handbags.[10] The "sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit."[10]
Miles and Lillian Cahn bought the company through a leveraged buyout in 1961.[10]
In 1961, Cahn hired Bonnie Cashin, a sportswear pioneer, to design handbags for Coach.[10] Cashin "revolutionized the product's design," working as creative head for Coach from 1962 through 1974.[10]
Cashin instituted the inclusion of side pockets, coin purses, and brighter colors (as opposed to the usual hues of browns and tans) in the products.[10] Cashin also designed matching shoes, pens, key fobs, and eyewear,[10] and added hardware to both her clothes and accessories–particularly the silver toggle that became the Coach hallmark–declaring that she had been inspired by a memory of quickly fastening the top on her convertible sports car.
In 1979, Lewis Frankfort joined the company as vice-president of business development. During this time, Coach was making $6 million in sales and products were being distributed through the domestic wholesale channel, primarily in the northeastern United States.[11] He was mentored by the then executive VP of sales, Richard Rose. Richard joined Coach in 1965, and he is credited with making Coach a household name after putting the product in department stores across the United States and abroad. He retired from his position in the company in 1995.
In 1981, under Frankfort's leadership, the company opened its first directly operated retail location on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.[13]
1985: Sale to Sara Lee[edit]
In 1985, the Cahns decided to sell Coach Leatherware after determining they wanted to "devote more time to their growing goat farm and cheese production business called Coach Farm in Gallatinville, New York, which they began in 1983".[10] Coach was then sold to Sara Lee Corporation for a reported $30 million.[10] Lew Frankfort succeeded Cahn as president.[10]
Sara Lee structured Coach under its Hanes Group.[10] In early 1986, new boutiques were opened in Macy's stores in New York City and San Francisco. Additional Coach stores were under construction, and similar boutiques were to be opened in other major department stores later that year. By November 1986, the company was operating 12 stores, along with nearly 50 boutiques within larger department stores.
Sara Lee Corporation divested itself of Coach first, by selling 19.5% of their shares of Coach at the Coach IPO in October 2000, followed in April 2001, with the distribution of their remaining shares to Sara Lee’s stockholders through an exchange offer.[14]
1996: Reed Krakoff leads design[edit]
In 1996, Lew Frankfort was named chairman and CEO of Coach. The following year, under Frankfort's leadership, Coach hired Reed Krakoff, whose creative and commercials instincts aimed to make Coach products functional, lightweight, and stylish.[8] Krakoff's design transformed Coach from the relatively small company that it was in 1985 into the worldwide-known brand that it is today.[8][15]
2013–present[edit]
In February 2013, Coach named Victor Luis president and chief commercial officer and announced that he would become chief executive officer in January 2014, with Lew Frankfort continuing as executive chairman.[16] In 2013, Coach generated $5 billion in sales and operated approximately 1,000 directly operated locations globally, including North America, Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Europe.[2]
In 2014, the company announced Stuart Vevers as the new executive creative director, replacing Reed Krakoff.[17]
During 2014, Coach also announced that Lew Frankfort would retire as executive chairman at the expiration of his term in November 2014.[18]
In January 2015, Coach agreed to buy shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for up to $574 million in cash.[19] In the same year, Coach also launched Coach 1941, "a new, higher-priced line centered on ready-to-wear." [20]
Coach marked its 75th anniversary in 2016 with the announcement of its partnership with Selena Gomez.[21][22]
In May 2017 it was announced that Coach was ready to purchase Kate Spade for $2.4 billion.[23] Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. had previously expressed interest in buying Kate Spade.[24]

The Coach Foundation[edit]
The Coach Foundation was established in 2008 to support organizations that empower and educate women and children around the world.[33] According to the foundation’s website via Coach.com, the program has two areas of focus:

"Coach's Women's Initiative explores the best opportunities to help women fully realize their potential by supporting programs that encourage personal and economic empowerment.
Coach's Education Initiative focuses on improving educational opportunities for the underserved, to provide everyone with the opportunity to learn, grow and meaningfully contribute to our society."[33]

In 2016, "the Coach Foundation donated $3 million to Step Up, the New York-based nonprofit organization that helps teen girls fulfill their potential."[34] Additionally, Coach, Inc. also funds select projects that enhance the environment in communities where it conducts principal business operations.[35]
Operations[edit]
As of 2013, there were approximately 1,000 Coach stores in North America. Coach has also built a strong presence in the U.S. through Coach boutiques located within select department stores and specialty retailer locations.[14]
Coinciding with its 75th anniversary in 2016, Coach opened Coach House, a 20,000-square-foot Midtown Manhattan retail space.[36]
Today, Coach’s corporate headquarters remain in mid-town Manhattan on 34th Street, in the location of their former factory lofts. In August 2016, the company finalized the sale and leaseback of its office condo portion of 10 Hudson Yards – its headquarters. Coach received $707 million before transaction costs.[37]

History[edit]
1946-1985[edit]




190 Post St in San Francisco, CA






King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA


Coach was founded in 1941, as a family-run workshop in a loft on 34th Street in Manhattan,[8][9] with six leatherworkers who made wallets and billfolds by hand.[10]
In 1946, Miles Cahn and his wife Lillian joined the company.[11] Miles and Lillian Cahn were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business, and were knowledgeable about leatherworks and business.[10]
By 1950, Cahn had taken over the business. During the early years, Cahn noticed the distinctive properties and qualities of the leather used to make baseball gloves.

Since the leather absorbed dye very well, this process also created a richer, deeper color in the leather.[12] Soon after Cahn developed this new process, Lillian Cahn suggested to Miles that the company supplement the factory's men's accessories business by adding women's leather handbags.[10] The "sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit."[10]
Miles and Lillian Cahn bought the company through a leveraged buyout in 1961.[10]
In 1961, Cahn hired Bonnie Cashin, a sportswear pioneer, to design handbags for Coach.[10] Cashin "revolutionized the product's design," working as creative head for Coach from 1962 through 1974.[10]
Cashin instituted the inclusion of side pockets, coin purses, and brighter colors (as opposed to the usual hues of browns and tans) in the products.[10] Cashin also designed matching shoes, pens, key fobs, and eyewear,[10] and added hardware to both her clothes and accessories–particularly the silver toggle that became the Coach hallmark–declaring that she had been inspired by a memory of quickly fastening the top on her convertible sports car.
In 1979, Lewis Frankfort joined the company as vice-president of business development. During this time, Coach was making $6 million in sales and products were being distributed through the domestic wholesale channel, primarily in the northeastern United States.[11] He was mentored by the then executive VP of sales, Richard Rose. Richard joined Coach in 1965, and he is credited with making Coach a household name after putting the product in department stores across the United States and abroad. He retired from his position in the company in 1995.
In 1981, under Frankfort's leadership, the company opened its first directly operated retail location on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.[13]
1985: Sale to Sara Lee[edit]
In 1985, the Cahns decided to sell Coach Leatherware after determining they wanted to "devote more time to their growing goat farm and cheese production business called Coach Farm in Gallatinville, New York, which they began in 1983".[10] Coach was then sold to Sara Lee Corporation for a reported $30 million.[10] Lew Frankfort succeeded Cahn as president.[10]
Sara Lee structured Coach under its Hanes Group.[10] In early 1986, new boutiques were opened in Macy's stores in New York City and San Francisco. Additional Coach stores were under construction, and similar boutiques were to be opened in other major department stores later that year. By November 1986, the company was operating 12 stores, along with nearly 50 boutiques within larger department stores.
Sara Lee Corporation divested itself of Coach first, by selling 19.5% of their shares of Coach at the Coach IPO in October 2000, followed in April 2001, with the distribution of their remaining shares to Sara Lee’s stockholders through an exchange offer.[14]
1996: Reed Krakoff leads design[edit]
In 1996, Lew Frankfort was named chairman and CEO of Coach. The following year, under Frankfort's leadership, Coach hired Reed Krakoff, whose creative and commercials instincts aimed to make Coach products functional, lightweight, and stylish.[8] Krakoff's design transformed Coach from the relatively small company that it was in 1985 into the worldwide-known brand that it is today.[8][15]
2013–present[edit]
In February 2013, Coach named Victor Luis president and chief commercial officer and announced that he would become chief executive officer in January 2014, with Lew Frankfort continuing as executive chairman.[16] In 2013, Coach generated $5 billion in sales and operated approximately 1,000 directly operated locations globally, including North America, Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Europe.[2]
In 2014, the company announced Stuart Vevers as the new executive creative director, replacing Reed Krakoff.[17]
During 2014, Coach also announced that Lew Frankfort would retire as executive chairman at the expiration of his term in November 2014.[18]
In January 2015, Coach agreed to buy shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for up to $574 million in cash.[19] In the same year, Coach also launched Coach 1941, "a new, higher-priced line centered on ready-to-wear." [20]
Coach marked its 75th anniversary in 2016 with the announcement of its partnership with Selena Gomez.[21][22]
In May 2017 it was announced that Coach was ready to purchase Kate Spade for $2.4 billion.[23] Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. had previously expressed interest in buying Kate Spade.[24]

The Coach Foundation was established in 2008 to support organizations that empower and educate women and children around the world.[33] According to the foundation’s website via Coach.com, the program has two areas of focus:

"Coach's Women's Initiative explores the best opportunities to help women fully realize their potential by supporting programs that encourage personal and economic empowerment.
Coach's Education Initiative focuses on improving educational opportunities for the underserved, to provide everyone with the opportunity to learn, grow and meaningfully contribute to our society."[33]

In 2016, "the Coach Foundation donated $3 million to Step Up, the New York-based nonprofit organization that helps teen girls fulfill their potential."[34] Additionally, Coach, Inc. also funds select projects that enhance the environment in communities where it conducts principal business operations.[35]
Operations[edit]
As of 2013, there were approximately 1,000 Coach stores in North America. Coach has also built a strong presence in the U.S. through Coach boutiques located within select department stores and specialty retailer locations.[14]
Coinciding with its 75th anniversary in 2016, Coach opened Coach House, a 20,000-square-foot Midtown Manhattan retail space.[36]
Today, Coach’s corporate headquarters remain in mid-town Manhattan on 34th Street, in the location of their former factory lofts. In August 2016, the company finalized the sale and leaseback of its office condo portion of 10 Hudson Yards – its headquarters. Coach received $707 million before transaction costs.[37]
In 1999, Coach launched its online store at www.coach.com.[38]

History[edit]
1946-1985[edit]




190 Post St in San Francisco, CA






King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA


Coach was founded in 1941, as a family-run workshop in a loft on 34th Street in Manhattan,[8][9] with six leatherworkers who made wallets and billfolds by hand.[10]
In 1946, Miles Cahn and his wife Lillian joined the company.[11] Miles and Lillian Cahn were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business, and were knowledgeable about leatherworks and business.[10]
By 1950, Cahn had taken over the business. During the early years, Cahn noticed the distinctive properties and qualities of the leather used to make baseball gloves. With wear and use, the leather in a glove became softer and suppler. Attempting to mimic this process, Cahn made a way of processing the leather to make it stronger, softer, and more flexible. Since the leather absorbed dye very well, this process also created a richer, deeper color in the leather.[12] Soon after Cahn developed this new process, Lillian Cahn suggested to Miles that the company supplement the factory's men's accessories business by adding women's leather handbags.[10] The "sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit."[10]
Miles and Lillian Cahn bought the company through a leveraged buyout in 1961.[10]
In 1961, Cahn hired Bonnie Cashin, a sportswear pioneer, to design handbags for Coach.[10] Cashin "revolutionized the product's design," working as creative head for Coach from 1962 through 1974.[10]
Cashin instituted the inclusion of side pockets, coin purses, and brighter colors (as opposed to the usual hues of browns and tans) in the products.[10] Cashin also designed matching shoes, pens, key fobs, and eyewear,[10] and added hardware to both her clothes and accessories–particularly the silver toggle that became the Coach hallmark–declaring that she had been inspired by a memory of quickly fastening the top on her convertible sports car.
In 1979, Lewis Frankfort joined the company as vice-president of business development. During this time, Coach was making $6 million in sales and products were being distributed through the domestic wholesale channel, primarily in the northeastern United States.[11] He was mentored by the then executive VP of sales, Richard Rose. Richard joined Coach in 1965, and he is credited with making Coach a household name after putting the product in department stores across the United States and abroad. He retired from his position in the company in 1995.
In 1981, under Frankfort's leadership, the company opened its first directly operated retail location on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.[13]
1985: Sale to Sara Lee[edit]
In 1985, the Cahns decided to sell Coach Leatherware after determining they wanted to "devote more time to their growing goat farm and cheese production business called Coach Farm in Gallatinville, New York, which they began in 1983".[10] Coach was then sold to Sara Lee Corporation for a reported $30 million.[10] Lew Frankfort succeeded Cahn as president.[10]
Sara Lee structured Coach under its Hanes Group.[10] In early 1986, new boutiques were opened in Macy's stores in New York City and San Francisco. Additional Coach stores were under construction, and similar boutiques were to be opened in other major department stores later that year. By November 1986, the company was operating 12 stores, along with nearly 50 boutiques within larger department stores.
Sara Lee Corporation divested itself of Coach first, by selling 19.5% of their shares of Coach at the Coach IPO in October 2000, followed in April 2001, with the distribution of their remaining shares to Sara Lee’s stockholders through an exchange offer.[14]
1996: Reed Krakoff leads design[edit]
In 1996, Lew Frankfort was named chairman and CEO of Coach. The following year, under Frankfort's leadership, Coach hired Reed Krakoff, whose creative and commercials instincts aimed to make Coach products functional, lightweight, and stylish.[8] Krakoff's design transformed Coach from the relatively small company that it was in 1985 into the worldwide-known brand that it is today.[8][15]
2013–present[edit]
In February 2013, Coach named Victor Luis president and chief commercial officer and announced that he would become chief executive officer in January 2014, with Lew Frankfort continuing as executive chairman.[16] In 2013, Coach generated $5 billion in sales and operated approximately 1,000 directly operated locations globally, including North America, Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Europe.[2]
In 2014, the company announced Stuart Vevers as the new executive creative director, replacing Reed Krakoff.[17]
During 2014, Coach also announced that Lew Frankfort would retire as executive chairman at the expiration of his term in November 2014.[18]
In January 2015, Coach agreed to buy shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for up to $574 million in cash.[19] In the same year, Coach also launched Coach 1941, "a new, higher-priced line centered on ready-to-wear." [20]
Coach marked its 75th anniversary in 2016 with the announcement of its partnership with Selena Gomez.[21][22]
In May 2017 it was announced that Coach was ready to purchase Kate Spade for $2.4 billion.[23] Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. had previously expressed interest in buying Kate Spade.[24]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Before joining Coach, from 2002 to 2006, Luis was president and chief executive officer for Baccarat, Inc., leading North American operation of the French luxury brand.[28] Earlier in his career, Luis held marketing and sales positions within the Moët-Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) Group.
Stuart Vevers joined Coach in the fall of 2013 as executive creative director. Vevers joined Coach from Loewe, where he held the role of creative director since 2008.[29] Prior to Loewe, he served as creative director of Mulberry from 2005 to 2008. He began his career at Calvin Klein, and has contributed in creative roles with Bottega Veneta, Givenchy, and Louis Vuitton. In 2006, Vevers won the British Fashion Council’s Accessory Designer of the Year award.

He retired in December 2005, and currently serves Coach Inc. as independent chairman of the board, and the Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. as the director.[30]
Lillian Cahn died, aged 89, March 4, 2013, in Manhattan.[31] Miles Cahn died, aged 95, February 10, 2017, in Manhattan.[32] Richard Rose died, aged 87, May 7, 2017, in Massapequa, New York.[citation needed]
The Coach Foundation[edit]
The Coach Foundation was established in 2008 to support organizations that empower and educate women and children around the world.[33] According to the foundation’s website via Coach.com, the program has two areas of focus:

"Coach's Women's Initiative explores the best opportunities to help women fully realize their potential by supporting programs that encourage personal and economic empowerment.
Coach's Education Initiative focuses on improving educational opportunities for the underserved, to provide everyone with the opportunity to learn, grow and meaningfully contribute to our society."[33]

In 2016, "the Coach Foundation donated $3 million to Step Up, the New York-based nonprofit organization that helps teen girls fulfill their potential."[34] Additionally, Coach, Inc. also funds select projects that enhance the environment in communities where it conducts principal business operations.[35]
Operations[edit]
As of 2013, there were approximately 1,000 Coach stores in North America. Coach has also built a strong presence in the U.S. through Coach boutiques located within select department stores and specialty retailer locations.[14]
Coinciding with its 75th anniversary in 2016, Coach opened Coach House, a 20,000-square-foot Midtown Manhattan retail space.[36]
Today, Coach’s corporate headquarters remain in mid-town Manhattan on 34th Street, in the location of their former factory lofts. In August 2016, the company finalized the sale and leaseback of its office condo portion of 10 Hudson Yards – its headquarters. Coach received $707 million before transaction costs.[37]

Selling Channels: How Coach Products Reach Customers


By Phalguni Soni - Disclosure 


					 |
				

				Jan 16, 2015				8:54 am EDT            










Coach’s selling channels
Coach, Inc. (COH) distributes products through wholesale and direct-to-customer channels. In North America, wholesale channels primarily include shops-within-shops, at major department stores including Macy’s (M), Nordstrom (JWN), and Dillard’s (DDS).
All three of these department stores are part of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) and the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (FXD).

Coach runs its own shops-within-shops. Furnishings and fixtures at these shops-within-shops are owned by Coach. Department stores such as Macy’s also offer Coach’s products through their websites, separately from Coach’s own e-commerce websites. In North America, there are ~1,000 wholesale Coach locations.



International strategy
In international markets, the wholesale channel include sales to other retail customers and distributors in 35 countries.
Coach’s expansion strategy in international markets involves an initial joint venture or distribution arrangement with local partners. Subsequently, the company aims to buyout its business partner’s shares in order to grow market share more aggressively and maintain control over its brand. The company has applied this strategy in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Mainland China, Germany, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among other countries.
Retail stores and factory outlets
These include revenues earned from retail stores owned by Coach (COH) in both North America and overseas. Aside from retail stores, Coach also operates factory outlets in the US and Canada. While retail stores are situated in metropolitan areas and regional malls, factory outlets are located in geographic areas at least 30 miles from major markets.
Coach also owns several flagship stores at highly visible locations in larger cities including New York City, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Toronto, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and London, among others. These stores stock the full assortment of Coach products.
Worldwide, store count stood at 1,019 stores as at the end of 1Q15.1 These consisted of 812 retail stores and 207 factory outlets. Factory outlets are double the size of retail stores, averaging ~5.400 square feet compared to 2,000–2,700 square feet for retail stores.
Square footage
Square footage stood at 2.9 million square feet by the end of fiscal 2014. This included ~1.8 million and ~1.1 million square feet for retail (XRT) stores and factory outlets, respectively. In comparison, worldwide square footage for newer rivals Michael Kors (KORS) and Kate Spade (KATE) stood at 944,000 and 678,000, respectively.
Licensing revenues
As discussed previously in this series, Coach has several licensing deals for watches, shoes, eyewear, and fragrances. These products are available through any of the above-mentioned channels. Licensees may also sell Coach products through other channels, with the company’s permission.
Other locations where Coach products are available include duty-free shops and specialty stores.
E-commerce sales
E-commerce has been an important growth driver for Coach. We’ll discuss the company’s e-commerce sales and initiatives in Part 10 of this series.


 Fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, quarter ending September 27, 2014 ↩
