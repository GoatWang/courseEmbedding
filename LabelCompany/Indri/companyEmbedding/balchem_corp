Industrial Products

Balchem Corporation manufactures and sells choline and certain derivatives  into various industrial applications, predominately as a component for hydraulic fracturing of shale natural gas wells.
Choline Chloride in Clay Stabilization for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Drilling and stimulation in shale and other clay containing formations pose challenges due to clay swelling. This swelling causes a number of issues including:

Wellbore instability
Cuttings disintegration
Bit balling
Fines migration
Reductions in permeability of the formation to hydrocarbons

These issues can result in higher drilling costs and slower production rates.  Clay stabilizers reduce clay swelling and its associated risks leading to lower drilling costs and improved production rates.
Potassium chloride (KCL) is commonly used in preventing the swelling of clay as a temporary clay stabilizer.   However, the use of KCL in drilling carries environmental concerns as clorides do not degrade and can enter surface water carrying heavy metal including cadmium and mercury.
Choline chloride and choline bicarbonate offer an attractive, effective and more environmentally responsible alternative than other clay stabilizers. Balchem's industrial grade Choline Bicarbonate is completely chloride free while our Choline chloride reduces the amount of chlorides released into the environment up to 75% when compared to KCL.  The key features offered by Choline salts as an alternative to traditional clay stabilizers include:

Biodegradability and reduction in the amount of chlorides
Superior performance and use at much lower levels
Compatibility with brine, calcium chloride and KCL solutions
Ability to work well with known fracturing fluids, cross-linkers and breakers
Minimization in chemical handling including pre-mixing and saltwater disposal
Flexibility for use in all environments

To learn more about our industial grade Choline salts and their effectiveness as a clay stabilizer, please download our brochures or contact:

Choline Salts - Clay Stabilizers
Choline Products - Environmentally Responsible





Choline Hydroxide for the Printed Circuit Board Industry
Printed circuit boards used to electrically connect and mechanically support electronic components using conductive pathways are present in virtually all but the simplest commercially produced electronic devices. With the increasing demand for advanced printed circuit boards with smaller and smaller dimensions, chemical strippers and etchants must meet the demanding challenges of manufacturing these smaller and more complex printed circuit boards.  Balchem's choline hydroxide is a cost effective, highly reliable stripping solvent used to strip unwanted photoresists from copper clad printed circuit boards after their initial processing.
Methylamines
Through its European operations, Balchem is a leading producer of Methylamines.  These products, Monomethylamine (MMA), Dimethylamine (DMA), and Trimethyamine (TMA) are important chemical building blocks that are used in a diverse variety of applications.  Among the varied uses, methylamines are critical ingredients in the production of agricultural herbicides, water treatment chemicals, oil and gas treatment, and rubber production.  Balchem produces methylamines in both anhydrous and aqueous solutions.  Please contact Balchem Italia for additional information.

History

Founded in January 1967, Balchem Corporation’s common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "BCPC." Our Corporate headquarters are located in New Hampton, New York, with manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States and in Marano Ticino, Italy.
Balchem provides state-of-the-art solutions and the finest quality products for a range of industries worldwide. Our Company consists of four business segments: Human Nutrition & Health; Animal Nutrition & Health; Specialty Products; and Industrial Products. Balchem employs over 1,000 people worldwide who are engaged in many diverse activities, developing our company into chosen market leadership positions.
Human Nutrition & Health
Our Human Nutrition & Health segment supplies ingredients in the food and beverage industry, providing customized solutions in powder, solid and liquid flavor delivery systems, spray dried emulsified powder systems, and cereal systems. Additionally, we provide microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food, pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification, processing, mixing, and packaging applications and shelflife. We also produce and market human grade choline nutrients and mineral amino acid chelated products through this segment for wellness applications. Choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants, processing dietary fat, reproductive development and neural functions, such as memory and muscle function. Our mineral amino acid chelates, specialized mineral salts, and mineral complexes are used as raw materials for inclusion in premier human nutrition products.
Animal Nutrition & Health
Our Animal Nutrition & Health (“ANH”) segment provides nutritional products derivedfrom our microencapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to basic choline chloride. For ruminant animals, our microencapsulated products boost health and milk production, delivering nutrient supplements that are biologically available, providing required nutritional levels. Our proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals and is marketed for use in animal feed throughout the world. ANH also manufactures and supplies choline chloride, an essential nutrient for monogastric animal health, predominantly to the poultry, pet and swine industries. Choline, which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms, plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat. Choline deficiency can result in reduced growth and perosis in poultry, and fatty liver, kidney necrosis and general poor health condition in swine. 
Specialty Products
Through ARC Specialty Products, Balchem provides packaged specialty chemicals for use in healthcare and other industries. ARC Specialty Products is the major North American supplier of packaged 100% Ethylene Oxide, for use as a medical device sterilant, to contract sterilizers, medical device manufacturers, and  others in the healthcare field. In addition to packaged 100% Ethylene Oxide, ARC Specialty Products supplies Ethylene Oxide blends, Propylene Oxide and Methyl Chloride in two-way, environmentally safe containers. Our micronutrient agricultural nutrition business sells chelated minerals primarily into high value crops. We have a unique and patented two-step approach to solving mineral deficiency in plants to optimize health, yield and shelf-life.
Industrial Products
In our Industrial Products segment, certain derivatives of choline chloride are manufactured and sold into industrial applications predominately as a component for hydraulic fracturing of shale natural gas wells. Our products offer an attractive, effective and more environmentally responsible alternative than other clay stabilizers.
Across all operations, our Company is committed to, and known for, superior customer service and satisfaction.

Health Products Drive Balchem Corporation's Growth
2016 ended with a strong quarter for the company, driven by a large acquisition and strong demand in the health market.











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Mar 1, 2017 at 3:43PM
            
            





Human and animal health businesses are helping drive Balchem Corporation's (NASDAQ:BCPC) top- and bottom-line growth and offsetting any weakness the company may see in industrials.
Fourth-quarter results released after the market closed on Tuesday showed a nice rise in sales and record results for 2016. Here's a look at the quarter's numbers and what investors should take from the results.

Data source: Balchem Corporation Q4 2016 earnings report.
What happened with Balchem Corporation this quarter? 
While the broad numbers are important, a look inside Balchem shows where the real industry trends are playing out. Here are a few highlights:

Human nutrition and health revenue was up 7.9% in the quarter to $75.9 million, helped by the acquisition of Albion. Earnings from operations were up 4% to $10.3 million, although if you pull out the impact of amortizing acquired intangible assets, the adjusted earnings from operations jumped 5.4% to $16.4 million. 
Animal nutrition and health revenue rose 2.6% to $42.5 million, and sales were up 3.9% sequentially. Year-over-year earnings for the segment were up 29% to $8.1 million as higher volumes helped drive operating results. 
Specialty product sales were up 24.3% to $16.2 million, but earnings from operations fell 13.8% to $5.3 million. An unfavorable mix of products and higher raw materials costs were blamed for the decline. 
Industrial product was the one weak spot, with sales down 22.1% to $6.2 million as volumes of choline and choline derivatives for oil and natural gas fracking declined. Despite the decline, earnings from operations rose $0.7 million to $0.09 million as the company focused on more profitable products. 

This completes a year where sales hit a record of $553.2 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 6.3% to $149.3 million. This gives management the freedom to acquire companies or improve the balance sheet with the cash generation going forward. 





What management said
CEO Ted Harris highlighted the company's financial improvement, despite some headwinds in 2016, mainly in energy markets. He sees human and animal health markets as growth drivers in the future through both organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions. 
It's possible that industrial revenue could be at a low point, too, with oil and natural gas drilling starting to pick up again. This will be an area to watch in 2017 because it could turn from a headwind to a slight tailwind. 
Looking forward
This year will build on the strategic moves management made to grow Balchem in 2016. The momentum we're seeing in operations isn't showing any signs of slowing, and with health a big focus for consumers, the growth trends should continue.
