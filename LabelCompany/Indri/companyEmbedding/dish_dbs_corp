                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

CES 2017: Dish Unit Pitches Android TV-Powered AirTV Box for $99
Also bundling in over-the-air TV adapter for $129.99, offering $50 in Sling TV programming credits (Updated)
1/03/2017  10:04 AM Eastern
 

By: Jeff  Baumgartner Follow @thebauminator  









Get complete coverage of CES 2017
 
AirTV, a new Android TV-powered device from a subsidiary of Dish DBS Corp. that targets cord-cutters by integrating over-the-air TV with over-the-top content, starts at $99, according to new details posted on the product web site, which proclaims that the product enables consumers to “Cut the cord. Keep the TV experience.”
 
RELATED: Redesigned ‘AirTV Player’ From EchoStar Surfaces
 
The baseline AirTV Player and remote control costs $99, while the AirTV Adapter, a dongle that tunes the box for local over-the-air channels, sells for $39.99. To prime the pump, AirTV is also offering a Player/Adapter bundle for $129.99 that discounts $10 from the purchase price. Users will also need to buy a digital antenna to capture over-the-air TV signals.
 
AirTV is also optimized for Sling TV, Dish Network’s OTT-TV service and integrates Netflix. Additionally, the device also supports apps and services from Google Play. The AirTV remote control features discrete buttons for direct access to Netflix and Google Play.
 
The site also notes that the AirTV Player supports 4K/Ultra HD video.
 
RELATED: FCC Gives EchoStar’s ‘AirTV’ a Lift
 
The initial price tag for the AirTV Player also includes $50 of Sling TV programming credits.
 
BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield made note of the new web site details Tuesday morning on Twitter.
 
AirTV's new wares are currently being sold via its web site.
 
Per the AirTV FAQ, AirTV recommends downstream speeds of at least 3 Mbps for standard definition streaming, and 5 Mbps for HD streaming. 
 
Update: According to the formal announcement of the product made Tuesday, consumers also have access to AirTV Pro Install, service that offers installation and setup of OTA antennas.  A standard one-room antenna installation, including the antenna, starts at $99.99 for an indoor antenna, or $149.99 for an outdoor antenna. Most appointments can be fulfilled on a next-day basis, and installation is available in 48 markets at launch, Air TV said, noting that its pro install services utilizes Winegard FlatWave Amped indoor antennas and Televes DigiNova BOSS outdoor antennas.
 
“There is an art to identifying the best antenna and positioning to get free HD TV channels in your home,” Mitch Weinraub, director of product development for AirTV, said in a statement. “For those times when it becomes more than a do-it-yourself project, AirTV Pro Install delivers expertise to your door, including a skilled technician armed with a ladder, tools and the know-how to make it simple for you.”
 
YouTube is also among the device’s pre-loaded apps.
 
Per the release, AirTV LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dish DBS Corp. 
 
Update 2: Technicolor confirmed that it was picked to build the AirTV player. Universal Electronics Inc. has been tapped for the AirTV’s Bluetooth-based voice remote, which also features UEI’s QuickSet Cloud device-discovery technology. UEI added that the AirTV remote also includes a new control function called One Touch View that enables users to automatically power on devices and switch inputs in the AV system for instant access to channels delivered on the AirTV Player.
