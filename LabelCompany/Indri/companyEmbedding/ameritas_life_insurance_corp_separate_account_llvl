        This prospectus describes the Policy, especially its Separate Account,
and should be read with the Policy. The Policy is designed to help you, the     
Policy Owner, provide life insurance protection while having flexibility, within
limits, as to the amount and timing of premium payments, the amount of the death
benefit, and how to invest your Policy value. The value of your Policy will go  
up or down based on the investment performance of the investment options you    
choose. The amount of the death benefit can also vary as a result of investment 
performance.                                                                    

      You may allocate all or part of your Policy value among a variety of
variable investment options where you have the investment risk, including       
possible loss of principal. They are listed in the Investment Options section of
this prospectus.                                                                

         You may also allocate all or part of your investment to a Fixed Account
fixed interest rate option where we have the investment risk and guarantee a    
certain return on your investment.                                              

Please Read this  Prospectus  Carefully  and Keep It for Future  Reference.  It 
provides information you should consider before investing in a Policy.          
Prospectuses for the portfolios  underlying the Subaccount  variable  investment
options are available without charge from your sales  representative or from our
Service Center.                                                                 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") does not pass upon the
accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus, and has not approved or disapproved
 the Policy. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

POLICY SUMMARY 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following is intended as a summary.  Please read each section of
this prospectus for additional detail.                                          

      The AMERITAS LOW-LOAD Variable Universal Life Policy is a flexible
premium life insurance policy offered and issued by Ameritas Life Insurance     
Corp. ("Ameritas"), 5900 "O" Street, Lincoln, Nebraska 68510. The Policy will   
usually be unsuitable for short-term savings or short-term life insurance needs.
We are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the Policy. The Policy pays  
death benefit proceeds to the Policy beneficiary upon the insured's death, or   
pays a Cash Surrender Value to you if you surrender the Policy. The insured     
cannot be over age 80 on the insured's birthday nearest the Policy issue date.  
We will only issue the Policy for an initial specified amount of insurance      
coverage of $100,000 or more.                                                   

       You have flexibility under the Policy. Within certain limits, you can
vary the amount and timing of premium payments, change the death benefit, and   
transfer amounts among the investment options. You may allocate Policy premium  
and value among several different variable investment options where you can gain
or lose money on your investment, or to a fixed rate option where we guarantee  
you will earn a fixed rate of interest. You can take out a Policy loan, make a  
partial withdrawal, or surrender your Policy completely, subject to certain     
restrictions. However, unpaid loans, partial withdrawals and surrenders may be  
subject to income tax and penalty tax, and unpaid loans and withdrawals will    
decrease death benefit protection and may cause the need for additional premium 
to keep the Policy in force.                                                    

       Your Policy value and death benefit will go up or down as a result of
the investment experience of your Policy. The fund prospectuses accompanying    
this Policy prospectus provide comprehensive discussion of the risks of each    
portfolio. Even if you pay Planned Periodic Premiums, your Policy could lapse if
the Policy value is not enough to pay the Policy's charges. Your Policy's death 
benefit will never be less than the then current Specified Amount of insurance  
coverage less any outstanding loans and loan interest, and less any due but     
unpaid Policy charges. The Policy remains in force until surrendered for its    
Cash Surrender Value, or all proceeds have been paid as a death benefit, or     
until it lapses because the Cash Surrender Value is insufficient to keep the    
Policy in force.                                                                

Buying a Policy might not be advisable if it is just replacing
existing life insurance. You may wish to consult with your
 financial or insurance adviser.

     reduced by any Policy loan balance,  unpaid loan interest,  and any monthly
deductions due but unpaid at death.

   We currently do not assess a separate charge against our Separate
Account or Fixed Account for any income taxes. We may, however, make such a     
charge in the future if income or gains within the Separate Account will incur  
any income tax liability, or if tax treatment of our Company changes.

CHARGES EXPLAINED 

       For Policies issued on a unisex basis in certain states or in certain
cases, sex-distinct rates do not apply. Certain charges expressly permit you to 
designate the investment options from which the charge is to be deducted. If    
there are insufficient funds in such a designated investment option, and for all
other charges deducted from total Policy value, charges are deducted pro-rata   
from your selected Subaccount and Fixed Account investment options.             

TRANSACTION FEES                                              

o        Percent of Premium Charge                                              
    We currently deduct a percentage of each Policy premium payment we
receive as a percent of premium charge. This charge partially offsets premium   
taxes imposed by some States and local governments and federal taxes on certain 
capitalized acquisition expenses. We do not expect to profit from this charge.  

o        Surrender Charge and Sales Load Charge                                 
The Policy has no surrender charge and no sales load charge.  

o        Partial Withdrawal Charge                                              
      Upon a partial withdrawal from your Policy, we will deduct a partial
withdrawal charge. This fee will be deducted from the investment options and in 
the same allocation as your partial withdrawal allocation instruction; if that  
is not possible (due to insufficient value in one of the investment options you 
elect) or you have not given such instructions, we will deduct this fee on a    
pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account. Taxes and
tax penalties may apply.                                                        

o        Transfer Fee                                                           
       Currently, we do not impose a transfer fee. We may, however, charge a
transfer fee for any transfer in excess of 15 transfers per Policy Year. This   
fee may be deducted from only Policy investment options you designate; if that  
is not possible (due to insufficient value in an investment option you elect) or
you have not provided such instructions, we will deduct this fee on a pro-rata  
basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account.                   

PERIODIC CHARGES:  MONTHLY DEDUCTIONS FROM POLICY VALUE       

     The following charges are deducted from Policy value on each Policy
Month date.                                                                     

o        Cost of Insurance Charge                                               
    The cost of insurance rate per $1,000 of net amount at risk cannot
exceed the guaranteed cost of insurance rate that is set forth in the Policy.   
The maximum cost of insurance each month can be determined by using the         
guaranteed cost of insurance rate in the formula below for cost of insurance.   

    The cost of insurance charge is for providing insurance protection
under the Policy. Because the cost of insurance charge depends upon several     
variables, the cost for each Policy Month can vary from month to month. The cost
of insurance rate for the initial specified amount of insurance coverage varies 
by the insured's sex, issue age, risk class and the length of time the Policy   
has been in force. The cost of insurance rate for an increase in specified      
amount varies by the insured's sex, age and risk class at the time of the       
increase, and the length of time the Policy has been in force since the         
increase. We may use current cost of insurance rates less than those shown in   
the Policy, and reserve the right to change them so long as they do not exceed  
the rates shown in the Policy. Changes will equally apply to similarly situated 
Policy owners and be based on changes in future expectations of factors such as 
investment earnings, mortality, persistency, and expenses. We expect a profit   
from this charge. Ask for a Policy illustration or see your Policy for these    
charges applicable to you.                                                      

The Cost of Insurance each month equals:                                        
-    The "Net Amount at Risk" for the month;                                    
multiplied by                                                         
-    The cost of insurance rate per $1,000 of net amount at risk; divided by    
-    $1,000.                                                                    

The Net Amount at Risk in any month equals:                                     

-    The death benefit on the Policy Month date, discounted at the guaranteed   
rate of interest for the Fixed Account for one month; minus           
-    The Policy value on the Policy Month date after deducting the charge for   
   any optional features selected and the administrative charges but not the
cost of insurance charge.

o        Administrative Charge                                                  
     The administrative charge partially compensates us for our costs in
issuing and administering the Policy and operating the Separate Account. We do  
not anticipate making a profit from this charge.                                

o        Cost of Optional Features                                              
        The cost for any optional features you select (sometimes called Policy
"Riders") is also deducted monthly from Policy value. See the CHARGES section   
for information about the costs of these features, and refer to APPENDIX A for  
descriptions of these features. Optional features may not be available in all   
states.                                                                         

PERIODIC CHARGES: DAILY DEDUCTION FROM SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS

       The following charges are applied daily to Separate Account assets in
determining the daily Accumulation Unit value of each Subaccount.               

o        Risk Charge                                                            
      The risk charge is for the mortality risks we assume - that insureds
may live for shorter periods of time than we estimate, and also compensates us  
for the Policy expense risks we assume. If this charge exceeds our actual costs 
to cover these risks, the excess goes to our general account. Conversely, if    
this charge is not enough, we bear the additional expense, not you. We expect a 
profit from this charge.                                                        

o        Portfolio Charges                                                      
Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio has investment advisory
expenses. These expenses, as of the end of each portfolio's last fiscal year,   
are stated in this prospectus' CHARGES section and described in more detail in  
each fund's prospectus. A portfolio's charges and expenses are not deducted from
your Policy value. Instead, they are reflected in the daily value of portfolio  
shares which, in turn, will affect the daily Accumulation Unit value of the     
Subaccounts. These charges and expenses help to pay the portfolio's investment  
adviser and operating expenses.                                                 

INVESTMENT OPTIONS 

         The Policy allows you to choose from a wide array of investment options
- each chosen for its potential to meet specific investment objectives.         

 You may allocate all or a part of your premiums among the Ameritas Life
Insurance Corp. Separate Account LLVL (the "Separate Account") variable         
investment options or the Fixed Account fixed interest rate option. Allocations 
must be in whole percentages and total 100%. The variable investment options,   
which invest in underlying portfolios, are listed and described in this section 
of this prospectus.                                                             

The  value  of your  Policy  will go up () or down ()  based  on the  investment
performance  of the  variable  investment  options  you choose.  The  investment
results of each variable  investment option are likely to differ  significantly,
and vary over time.  They do not earn a fixed  interest  rate.  Please  consider
carefully,  and on a continuing basis,  which investment  options best suit your
long-term investment objectives and risk tolerance.                             

SEPARATE ACCOUNT VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS                  

       The Separate Account provides you with variable investment options in
the form of underlying portfolio investments. Each underlying portfolio is an   
open-end investment management company. When you allocate investments to an     
underlying portfolio, those investments are placed in a Subaccount of the       
Separate Account corresponding to that portfolio, and the Subaccount in turn    
invests in the portfolio. The Policy value of your Policy depends directly on   
the investment performance of the portfolios that you select.                   

       The SEC does not supervise the management or the investment practices
or policies of the Separate Account or us. Under Nebraska law, we own the       
Separate Account assets, but they are held separately from our other assets and 
are not charged with any liability or credited with any gain of business        
unrelated to the Separate Account. Any and all distributions made by the        
underlying portfolios, with respect to the shares held by the Separate Account, 
will be reinvested in additional shares at net asset value. We are responsible  
to you for meeting the obligations of the Policy, but we do not guarantee the   
investment performance of any of the variable investment option's underlying    
portfolios. We do not make any representations about their future performance.

 You bear the risk that the variable investment options you select
may fail to meet their objectives, that they could decrease in
 value, and that you could lose principal.

Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio operates as a separate 
investmentoption, and the income or losses of one generally has no effect on the
investment performance of any other. Complete descriptions of each variable     
investment option's investment objectives and restrictions and other material   
information related to an investment in the variable investment option are      
contained in the prospectuses for each of the underlying portfolios which       
accompany this prospectus. The Separate Account Subaccount underlying portfolios
listed below are designed primarily as investments for variable annuity and     
variable life insurance policies issued by insurance companies. They are not    
publicly traded mutual funds available for direct purchase by you. There is no  
assurance the investment objectives will be met.                                

      The underlying  portfolios in the Separate  Account are NOT publicly
traded mutual funds,  and are NOT the same as publicly  traded mutual funds with
very similar  names.  The  portfolios  are only  available  as separate  account
investment  options in life  insurance or variable  annuity  policies  issued by
insurance  companies,  or through  participation in certain qualified pension or
retirement plans.                                                               
Even if the investment options and policies of some underlying
portfolios  available  under the  Policy may be very  similar to the  investment
objectives  and policies of publicly  traded mutual funds that may be managed by
the same  investment  adviser,  the  investment  performance  and results of the
portfolios available under the Policy may vary significantly from the investment
results of such other publicly traded mutual funds.                             
         You should read the prospectuses for the underlying portfolios together
with this prospectus for more information.                                      

        This information is just a summary for each underlying  portfolio. You
should read the series fund prospectus for an underlying portfolio for more     
information about that portfolio, including detailed information about the      
portfolio's fees and expenses, investment strategy and investment objective,    
restrictions, and potential risks such as those related to mixed and shared     
funding for portfolios that are also offered through variable life insurance    
policies and qualified pension and retirement plans. To get a copy of any

o        Adding, Deleting, or Substituting Variable Investment Options          
        We do not control the Subaccounts' underlying portfolios, so we cannot
guarantee that any of the portfolios will always be available. We retain the    
right to change the investments of the Separate Account, and to eliminate the   
shares of any Subaccount's underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another
series fund portfolio. If the

shares of the underlying portfolio are no longer available for investment or if,
in our judgment,  investment in the portfolio would be  inappropriate in view of
the purposes of the Separate  Account,  we will first notify you and receive any
necessary SEC and state approval before making such a change.                   

      New Separate Account underlying portfolios may be added, or existing
funds eliminated, when, in our sole discretion, conditions warrant a change. If 
a portfolio is eliminated, we will ask you to reallocate any amount in the      
liminated portfolio. If you do not reallocate these amounts, we will            
automatically reinvest them in the Vanguard VIF Money Market Subaccount. If we  
make a portfolio substitution or change, we may change the Policy to reflect the
substitution or change. Our Separate Account may be (i) operated as an          
investment management company or any other form permitted by law, (ii)          
deregistered with the SEC if registration is no longer required, or (iii)       
combined with one or more other separate accounts. To the extent permitted by   
law, we also may transfer assets of the Separate Account to other accounts.

Voting Rights                                                                   
       As a Policy Owner, you may have voting rights in the portfolios whose
shares underlie the Subaccounts in which you invest. You will receive proxy     
material, reports, and other materials relating to each underlying portfolio in 
which you have voting rights. If you send us written voting instructions, we    
will follow your instructions in voting the portfolio shares attributable to    
your Policy. If you do not send us written instructions, we will vote those     
shares in the same proportions as we vote the shares for which we have received 
instructions from other Policy owners. We will vote shares that we hold in the  
same proportions as we vote the shares for which we receive instructions from   
other Policy owners. It is possible that a small number of Policy owners can    
determine the outcome of a voting proposal. The underlying portfolios may not   
hold routine annual shareholder meetings.                                       

FIXED ACCOUNT FIXED INTEREST RATE OPTION                      

     There is one fixed interest rate option ("Fixed Account"), where we
bear the investment risk. We guarantee that you will earn a minimum interest    
rate that will yield at least 3.5% per year, compounded annually. We may declare
a higher current interest rate. However, you bear the risk that we will not     
credit more interest than will yield the minimum guaranteed rate per year for   
the life of the Policy. We have sole discretion over how assets allocated to the
Fixed Account are invested, and we bear the risk that those assets will perform 
better or worse than the amount of interest we have declared. The focus of this 
prospectus is to disclose the Separate Account aspects of the Policy. Refer to  
the Policy for additional details regarding the Fixed Account.                  

All amounts allocated to the Fixed Account become assets of our general account.
Interest in the general  account has not been registered with the SEC and is not
subject to SEC  regulation.  Therefore,  SEC staff have not  reviewed  the Fixed
Account disclosures in this prospectus.                                         

TRANSFERS                                                     

   The Policy is designed for long-term investment, not for use with
professional "market timing" services or use with programmed, large or frequent 
transfers. Excessive transfers could harm other policy owners, annuitants and   
beneficiaries by having a detrimental effect on investment portfolio management.
In addition to the right of the portfolios to impose redemption fees on         
short-term trading, we reserve the right to reject any specific premium         
allocation or transfer request, if in the judgment of a Subaccount portfolio    
fund advisor, a Subaccount portfolio would be unable to invest effectively in   
accordance with its investment objectives and policies, or if Policy owners     
would otherwise potentially be adversely affected.                              

         Transferring money out of a Subaccount within 60 days of a purchase may
be considered market timing. However, any portfolio fund advisor may establish  
their own standards, and each transaction may be evaluated on its own.          
Ultimately the portfolio fund advisor has the authority to make this            
determination.                                                                  

        Subject to restrictions during the "right to examine period" and prior
to the Annuity Date, you may transfer Policy value from one Subaccount to       
another, from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account, or from the Fixed      
Account to any Subaccount, subject to these rules:                              

Transfer Rules:                                               
        o    A transfer is considered any single request to move assets from
            one or more Subaccounts or the Fixed Account to one or more of
the other Subaccounts or the Fixed Account.       
        o    We must receive notice of the transfer - either Written Notice,
      an authorized telephone transaction, or by Internet when
               available. Transfer requests by facsimile, telephone, or Internet
         must be sent to us by 3:00 p.m. Central Time (2:30 p.m. for
         Rydex) for same day processing. Requests received later are
             processed on the next trading day. Fax requests must be sent to
          us at 402-467-7923. If requests are faxed elsewhere, we will
               process them as of the day they are received by our trading unit.
    o    The transferred amount must be at least $250, or the entire
            Subaccount or Fixed Account value if it is less. (If the value
               remaining after a transfer will be less than $250 in a Subaccount
               or $100 in the Fixed Account, we will include that amount as part
of the transfer.)                                 
              -    If the Dollar Cost Averaging systematic transfer program is
                  used, then the minimum transfer amount out of a Subaccount
                    or the Fixed Account is the lesser of $100 or the balance in
                the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program, the
             maximum amount that may be transferred from the Fixed
              Account each month is 1/36th of the value of the Fixed
                Account at the time the Dollar Cost Averaging program is
                established. While a Dollar Cost Averaging program is in
               effect, elective transfers out of the Fixed Account are
prohibited.                             
          -    The Portfolio Rebalancing and Earnings Sweep systematic
          transfer programs have no minimum transfer limits.
      o    The first 15 transfers each Policy Year are free. Thereafter,
              transfers may result in a $10 charge for each transfer. This fee
              is deducted on a pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts
and the Fixed

            Account; it is not subtracted from the amount of the transfer.
             Transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward
the 15 free transfer limit.                       
     o    A transfer from the Fixed Account (except made pursuant to a
systematic transfer program):                     
-    may be made only once each Policy Year;      
-    may be delayed up to six months;             
       -    is limited during any Policy Year to the greater of:
                    -    25% of the  Fixed  account  value  on the  date  of the
    initial transfer during that year;
                    -    the greatest amount of any similar  transfer out of the
                 Fixed Account during the previous 13 months; or
-    $1,000.                            
       o    If the Policy value in any Subaccount falls below $250, we may
             transfer the remaining balance, without charge, to the Vanguard
VIF Money Market Subaccount.                      
         o    Rydex Subaccount transfers received later than 2:30 p.m. Central
Time are processed the next Business Day.         
       o    We reserve the right to limit transfers, or to modify transfer
               privileges, and we reserve the right to change the transfer rules
           at any time. We, and most of our portfolio managers, consider
               market timing strategies, programmed transfers, or transfers that
        are large in relation to the total assets of an investment
         option's underlying portfolio as disruptive. For those fund
            managers who deem such activities disruptive, we may react by,
          among other things, restricting the availability of personal
              telephone requests, facsimile transmissions, automated telephone
             services, Internet services or any electronic transfer service.
            We may also refuse to act on transfer instructions of an agent
            acting under a power of attorney or otherwise who is acting on
              behalf of one or more Owners. In making these determinations, we
              may consider the combined transfer activity of annuity contracts
          and life insurance policies that we believe are under common
             ownership, control or direction. Certain fund managers, such as
              Rydex, may permit short-term trading within their portfolios and
      will have disclosed this practice in their prospectuses.
       o    In the event you authorize telephone or Internet transfers, we
              are not liable for telephone or Internet instructions that we in
          good faith believe you authorized. We will employ reasonable
  procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine.

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES                                          

    Where permitted and subject to our rules (including those Transfer
Rules above regarding rejection of a transfer request), we may accept your      
authorization to have a third party (such as your sales representative or       
someone else you name) exercise transfers or investment allocations on your     
behalf. Third-party transfers and allocations are subject to the same rules as  
all other transfers and allocations. You can make this election on the          
application or by sending us Written Notice on a form provided by us. Please    
note that any person or entity you authorize to make transfers or allocations on
your behalf, including any investment advisory, asset allocation, money         
management or timing service, does so independently from any agency relationship
they may have with us for the sale of the Policies. They are accountable to you 
alone for such transfers or allocations. We are not responsible for such        
transfers or allocations on your behalf, or recommendations to you, by such     
third-party services. You should be aware that charges assessed by such third   
parties for their service are separate from and in addition to charges paid     
under the Policy.                                                               

DISRUPTIVE TRADING PRACTICES                                  

       The Policy is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading
in response to short-term fluctuations in the market. Such frequent trading,    
programmed transfers, or transfers that are large in relation to the total      
assets of a Subaccount's underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a       
Subaccount's underlying portfolio and raise expenses. This in turn can hurt     
performance of an affected Subaccount and therefore hurt your Policy's          
performance.                                                                    

Organizations or individuals that use market timing investment strategies and   
make frequent or other disruptive transfers should not purchase the Policy,     
unless such transfers are limited to Subaccounts whose underlying portfolio     
prospectuses specifically permit such transfers.                                

      Policy Owners should be aware that we are contractually obligated to
provide Policy Owner transaction data relating to trading activities to the     
underlying funds on written request and, on receipt of written instructions from
a fund, to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by Policy Owners 
identified by an underlying fund as having engaged in transactions that violate 
the trading policies of the fund.                                               

     We reserve the right to reject or restrict, in our sole discretion,
transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party
authorized to give transfer instructions. We further reserve the right to impose
restrictions on transfers that we determine, in our sole discretion, will       
disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other Policy owners.
Restrictions may include changing, suspending or terminating telephone, on-line 
and facsimile transfer privileges. We will enforce any Subaccount underlying    
portfolio manager's                                                             

-13-

P-->485APOS15th�Page�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
restrictions imposed upon transfers considered by the manager to be disruptive. 
Our disruptive trading procedures may vary from Subaccount to Subaccount, and   
may also vary due to differences in operational systems and contract provisions.
However, any Subaccount restrictions will be uniformly applied.                 

      There is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective in
preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity. Our ability to   
detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptive    
trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological      
limitations. The discretionary nature of our disruptive trading procedures may  
result in some Policy owners being able to market time, while other Policy      
owners bear the harm associated with timing. Also, because other insurance      
companies and retirement plans may invest in Subaccount underlying portfolios,  
we cannot guarantee that Subaccount underlying portfolios will not suffer harm  
from disruptive trading within contracts issued by them. Certain Subaccount     
underlying portfolios, such as the Rydex Subaccounts, may permit short-term     
trading and will have disclosed this practice in their portfolio's prospectus.  

Excessive Transfers                                           
    We reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are
         engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy owners.
     In making this determination, we will consider, among other things:
o    the total dollar amount being transferred;             
o    the number of transfers you make over a period of time;
 o    whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take
              advantage of short term market fluctuations, particularly within
certain Subaccount underlying portfolios;         
          o    whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a
             third party on behalf of individual Policy owners in the group;
and                                               
o    the investment objectives and/or size of the Subaccount
underlying portfolio.                             

Third Party Traders                                           
     We reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other
    third party authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple
        Policy owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging in a
     pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy owners. In making
this determination, we may, among other things:               
     o    reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a
           power of attorney on behalf of more than one Policy owner, or
          o    reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual Policy
            owners who have executed transfer forms which are submitted by
               market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than
one Policy owner.                                 

  We will notify affected Policy owners before we limit transfers,
modify  transfer  procedures  or refuse to complete a transfer.  Transfers  made
pursuant to  participation  in a Dollar Cost Averaging,  Portfolio  Rebalancing,
Earnings Sweep or asset  allocation  program are not subject to these rules. See
the sections of the Prospectus  describing  those programs for the rules of each
program.                                                                        

SYSTEMATIC TRANSFER PROGRAMS                                  

        Transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward the 15
free transfer limit. We reserve the right to alter or terminate any systematic  
transfer program upon thirty days advance written notice. Only one systematic   
transfer program may be utilized at a time.                                     

o        Dollar Cost Averaging                                                  
         The Dollar Cost Averaging program allows you to automatically transfer,
on a periodic basis, a set dollar amount or percentage from the Vanguard Money  
Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account to any other Subaccount(s) or the Fixed  
Account. Requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount. You can begin  
Dollar Cost Averaging when you purchase the Policy or later. You can increase or
decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue the program at any
time. Dollar Cost Averaging is intended to limit loss by resulting in the       
purchase of more Accumulation Units when a portfolio's value is low, and fewer  
units when its value is high. However, there is no guarantee that such a program
will result in a higher Policy value, protect against a loss, or otherwise      
achieve your investment goals.                                                  

Dollar Cost Averaging Rules:                                  
    o    There is no additional charge for the Dollar Cost Averaging
program.                                          

o    We must receive notice of your election and any changed
            instruction either by Written Notice, by telephone transaction
instruction, or by Internet when available.       

o    Transfers can only occur monthly.                      
     o    The minimum transfer amount out of the Vanguard Money Market
          Subaccount or the Fixed Account is the lesser of $250 or the
             balance in the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program,
               the maximum amount that may be transferred from the Fixed Account
each month is 1/36th of the Fixed

             Account value at the time Dollar Cost Averaging is established.
          While a Dollar Cost Averaging program is in effect, elective
            transfers out of the Fixed Account are prohibited. There is no
         maximum transfer amount limitation applicable to any of the
Subaccounts.                                      
        o    Dollar Cost Averaging program transfers cannot begin before the
end of a Policy's "right to examine" period.      

      o    You may specify that transfers be made on the 1st through the
           28th day of the month. Transfers will be made on the date you
         specify (or if that is not a Business Day, then on the next
          Business Day). If you do not select a date, the program will
        begin on the next Policy Month date following the date the
Policy's "right to examine" period ends.          

        o    You can limit the number of transfers to be made, in which case
             the program will end when that number has been made. Otherwise,
         the program will terminate when the amount remaining in the
           Vanguard Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account is less
than $100.                                        
  o    Dollar Cost Averaging is not available when the Portfolio
Rebalancing program is elected.                   

o        Portfolio Rebalancing                                                  
       The Portfolio Rebalancing program allows you to rebalance your Policy
value among designated Subaccounts only as you instruct. You may change your    
rebalancing allocation instructions at any time. Any change will be effective   
when the next rebalancing occurs.                                               

Portfolio Rebalancing Program Rules:                          
    o    There is no additional charge for the Portfolio Rebalancing
program.                                          
o    The Fixed Account is excluded from this program.       
o    You must request the rebalancing program, give us your 
             rebalancing instructions, or request to end this program either
            by Written Notice, by telephone transaction instruction, or by
Internet when available.                          
   o    You may have rebalancing occur quarterly, semi-annually or
annually.                                         
    o    Portfolio Rebalancing is not available when the Dollar Cost
Averaging program is elected.                     

o        Earnings Sweep                                                         
         The Earnings Sweep program allows you to rebalance your Policy value by
automatically allocating earnings from your Subaccounts among designated        
investment options (Subaccounts or the Fixed Account), either based on your     
original Policy allocation of premiums or pursuant to new allocation            
instructions. You may change your Earnings Sweep program instructions at any    
time. Any change will be effective when the next sweep occurs.                  

Earnings Sweep Program Rules:                                 
      o    There is no additional charge for the Earnings Sweep program.
o    The Fixed Account is included in this program.         
  o    You must request the Earnings Sweep program, give us your
               allocation instructions, or request to end this program either by
         Written Notice, by telephone transaction instruction, or by
Internet when available.                          
     o    You may have your Earnings Sweep quarterly, semi-annually or
annually.                                         

MODEL ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM                                

         We may offer a model asset allocation program. However, you always have
the ability to construct your own asset allocation plan from among the          
investment options available in your Policy. Model asset allocation programs are
intended to match model risk tolerance and investment objectives with the       
investment options available in your Policy.                                    

         To assist you in your selection of an asset allocation model, our Model
Asset Allocation program uses the Morningstar Asset Allocator. This tool was    
developed by Morningstar Associates, LLC ("Morningstar") and is offered to you  
through a license agreement between Morningstar and our affiliate Ameritas      
Investment Corp. ("AIC"). The Model Asset Allocation program consists of five   
models, ranging from aggressive to conservative. Morningstar provides AIC with  
ongoing recommendations and monitoring of the portfolios that comprise the      
models.                                                                         

To participate in the asset allocation program:               
    o    AIC will serve as your investment adviser fiduciary for the
          program solely for purposes of development of the models and
            periodic updates to the models. You must give AIC your written
    consent and discretionary authority for AIC to give us
         instructions to allocate your premiums (or, for an existing
            Policy, Policy value) pursuant to the allocations of the model
               you select. AIC will also periodically instruct us to change your
              allocations consistent with any changes to the model made by AIC
               as recommended by Morningstar. AIC has no discretionary authority
to execute any other transfers for your Policy.   
o    You must complete the Asset Allocator Questionnaire.   
o    You must allocate all of your Policy value to one asset
               allocation model. We must receive notice of your asset allocation
       model election either by Written Notice or Internet (when
            available) before we can begin a program for you. Only you can
     select which model is best for you. The Asset Allocator
           Questionnaire can be an aid, but neither it nor AIC will make
this decision for you. You may wish to

               consult with your own financial professional to determine whether
            participation in the program is best for you, and if so, which
model is most suitable.                           
  o    Each calendar quarter we will automatically rebalance the
    Subaccount values to be consistent with the allocation
      percentages for the program model that you elected. Such
           rebalancing will be disclosed in quarterly statements to you.
              Performance of each model is updated daily on our website and is
available upon request.                           

    o    Annually, AIC will re-evaluate and may make changes to each
              investment level model based upon Morningstar's recommendations.
             When AIC updates the models, we will send you written notice of
            the updated models at least 30 days in advance of the date the
           updated models are to be effective. If you wish to accept the
           changes in your selected model, you will not need to take any
             action, as your Policy value and any subsequent premium will be
             reallocated automatically pursuant to the updated model. If you
               do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model, you can
          change to a different model or withdraw from the Model Asset
Allocation program.                               
       o    If you are currently participating in a Model Asset Allocation
             asset allocation model and you make changes to your allocations
             outside the model, you will not receive future notifications of
            model changes. You will then be considered as having withdrawn
             from the Model Asset Allocation program and as having cancelled
         your relationship with AIC for purposes of implementing the
program with your Policy.                         
  o    AIC is compensated by us as principal underwriter for the
               Policies. We and AIC may receive fees for administrative services
             from portfolios in the models. This additional compensation and
              related responsibilities may create conflicts of interest as AIC
               determines what portfolios should be in the models. Also, Calvert
            Variable Series, Inc. and Summit Mutual Funds, Inc., which are
        part of the UNIFI Mutual Holding Company and therefore are
            affiliated with us, have portfolios offered through the Policy
             (these portfolios may or may not be included in the models). We
           believe any potential risk of a conflict of interest in these
       arrangements is reduced or eliminated by contracting with
     Morningstar to independently evaluate and recommend the
             selection, allocation weighting, and periodic updates regarding
portfolios in the models.                         

        There is no additional charge for selecting the Model Asset Allocation
program. Although asset allocation programs are intended to mitigate investment 
risk, there is a risk that investing pursuant to a model will still lose value. 
For information about risks of participating in the Model Asset Allocation      
program and more detail about the program, including more information about     
conflicts of interest, ask for a copy of this prospectus' Statement of          
Additional Information. More information about AIC's role as investment advisor 
for the program is available on AIC's Form ADV Part II which is delivered to you
at the time you subscribe to the program. We may modify or discontinue the Model
Asset Allocation program at any time.                                           

OTHER IMPORTANT POLICY INFORMATION                                              
POLICY APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE                               

     The insured must not be older than age 80 on the insured's birthday
nearest to the Policy Date. To purchase a Policy, you must submit an            
application, at least the Initial Premium (see below), and provide evidence of  
the proposed insured's insurability satisfactory to us. Before accepting an     
application, we conduct underwriting to determine insurability. We reserve the  
right to reject any application or premium. If we issue a Policy, insurance     
coverage will be effective as of the Policy Date.                               

Replacing an existing life insurance policy is not always your best choice.     
Evaluate any replacement carefully.                                             

o        Application in Good Order                                              

         All application questions must be answered, but particularly note these
requirements:                                                                   
         o    The Owner's and insured's full name, Social Security number (tax
           identification number for a business or trust Owner), date of
             birth, and certain other required information must be included.
o    Your premium allocations must be complete, be in whole 
percentages, and total 100%.                      
o    Initial premium requirements must be met (see below).  
 o    Your signature and your agent's signature must be on the
application.                                      
o    City, state and date the application was signed must be
completed.                                        
       o    You must provide all information required for us to underwrite
              your application (including health and medical information about
       the insured, and other information we consider relevant).
          o    If you have one, please give us your e-mail address to facilitate
          receiving updated Policy information by electronic delivery.
          o    There may be forms in addition to the application required by law
               or regulation, especially when a replacement of other coverage is
involved.                                         
         o    Your agent must be both properly licensed and appointed with us.

Premium Requirements                                                            
        Your premium checks should be made payable to "Ameritas Life Insurance
Corp." We may postpone crediting any payment made by check until the check has  
been honored by your bank. Payment by certified check, banker's draft, or       
cashier's check will be promptly applied. Under our electronic fund transfer    
program, you may select a monthly payment schedule for us to automatically      
deduct premiums from your bank account or other sources.                        

Initial Premium                                               

o    At least 25% of the total first year guaranteed monthly
               deductions including charges for riders, and any substandard risk
            adjustments for the specified amount of insurance coverage you
apply for.                                        

Additional Premiums                                           
          o    Payment of additional premiums is flexible, but must be enough to
cover Policy charges.                             
       o    If a premium increases the net amount of insurance coverage at
        risk, it is subject to evidence of the insured's continued
             insurability and our underwriting requirements as to the amount
of the increase.                                  
       o    Planned Periodic Premiums may be paid annually, semi-annually,
         quarterly, or monthly. You may change your Planned Periodic
        Premium, subject to our approval. Because Policy value can
       fluctuate depending upon the performance of your selected
           variable investment options, payment of your Planned Periodic
         Premiums does not guarantee that your Policy will remain in
               force. Your Policy can lapse even if you pay all Planned Periodic
Premiums on time.                                 
   o    If there is a Policy loan, you should identify any payment
              intended to reduce a loan as a loan repayment; otherwise it will
be treated as a premium and added to Policy value.
 o    Additional premiums are applied pursuant to your current
   allocation instructions, unless you give us different
    instructions by Written Notice or authorized telephone
transaction when you make the payment.            
       o    We reserve the right to limit premiums or refund any values so
               the Policy qualifies as life insurance under the federal Internal
Revenue Code.                                     

o        Crediting and Allocating Premium                                       
    Once your application is in good order, we will credit initial net
premium to the Policy on the date the Policy is issued. All premiums are        
allocated to the Vanguard VIF Money Market Subaccount until 13 days after the   
date the Policy is issued to accommodate state "Right to Examine" rights under  
the Policy. Then, we allocate your Policy value to the investment options       
according to your allocation instructions. However, where allowed, if you have  
allocated 100% to the Fixed Account, the initial net premium is allocated to the
Fixed Account. In this instance, no further allocation will occur. If a Policy  
is not issued, we will return your premium.                                     

       Until your Policy is issued, premium payments received by us are held
in our general account and are credited with interest at a rate we determine.   

POLICY VALUE                                                  

      On your Policy's date of issue, Policy value equals your initial net
premium (premium less the percent of premium charge) less the Policy's first    
monthly deductions. On any Business Day thereafter, your total Policy value     
equals the sum of Policy value in the Separate Account variable investment      
options, the Fixed Account, and the Loan Account, minus any monthly deduction   
due and not paid.                                                               

o        Separate Account Value                                                 
     Premiums or transfers allocated to Subaccounts are accounted for in
Accumulation Units. The Policy value held in the Separate Account Subaccounts on
any Business Day is determined by multiplying each Subaccount's Accumulation    
Unit value by the number of Subaccount units allocated to the Policy. Each      
Subaccount's Accumulation Unit value is calculated at the end of each Business  
Day as follows:                                                                 

     (a)  the per share net asset value of the Subaccount's underlying
          portfolio as of the end of the current Business Day plus any
              dividend or capital gain distribution declared and unpaid by the
             underlying portfolio during that Business Day, times the number
      of shares held by the Subaccount, before the purchase or
redemption of any shares on that date; minus      
     (b)  the daily mortality and expense risk charge; and this result
divided by                                        
         (c)  the total number of Accumulation Units held in the Subaccount on
       the Business Day before the purchase or redemption of any
Accumulation Units on that day.                   

       When transactions are made to or from a Subaccount, the actual dollar
amounts are converted to Accumulation Units. The number of Accumulation Units   
for a transaction is equal to the dollar amount of the transaction divided by   
the Accumulation Unit value on the Business Day the transaction is made.        

       An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed
by the U.S. Government. There can be no assurance that the funds will be able to
maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share.

o        Fixed Account Value                                                    
   The Policy value of the Fixed Account on any Business Day equals:
          (a)  the Policy value of the Fixed Account at the end of the preceding
Policy Month; plus                                
        (b)  any net premiums credited to the Fixed Account since the end of
the previous Policy Month; plus                   
          (c)  any transfers from the Subaccounts to the Fixed Account since the
end of the previous Policy Month; plus            
       (d)  any transfers from the Loan Account to the Fixed Account since
the end of the previous Policy Month, minus       
       (e)  any transfers from the Fixed Account to the Loan Account since
the end of the previous Policy Month; minus       
     (f)  any transfers and transfer fee from the Fixed Account to the
           Subaccounts since the end of the previous Policy Month; minus
        (g)  any partial withdrawal and partial withdrawal charge taken from
           the Fixed Account since the end of the previous Policy Month;
minus                                             
        (h)  the Fixed Account's share of any monthly deductions from Policy
value; minus                                      
        (i)  the Fixed Account's share of charges for any optional features;
plus                                              
        (j)  interest credited on the Fixed Account balance since the end of
the previous Policy Month.                        

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX                                    

       If the age or sex of the insured or any person insured by a Policy or
rider has been misstated on the application, the Policy death benefit and any   
additional benefits provided will be those which would be purchased by the most 
recent cost of insurance charge and the cost of such additional benefits at the 
insured person's correct age or sex.                                            

SUICIDE                                                       

        We will pay the greater of the premiums received or Policy value, less
any partial withdrawals and indebtedness, if the insured, while sane or insane, 
commits suicide within two years (one year in Colorado and North Dakota) after  
the date the Policy was issued (and in Missouri, the insured intended suicide at
the time coverage was applied for). We will pay the greater of the monthly      
deductions for an increase in specified amount of insurance coverage or Policy  
value attributable to such an increase if the insured, while sane or insane,    
commits suicide within two years (one year in Colorado and North Dakota) after  
the effective date of any increase (and in Missouri, the insured intended       
suicide at the time the increase was applied for). Optional feature riders to   
the Policy may have separate suicide provisions.                                

INCONTESTABILITY                                              

     We will not contest the validity of the Policy after it has been in
force during the insured's lifetime for two years from the date the Policy was  
issued or for two years from the date of any reinstatement. We will not contest 
the validity of an increase in the specified amount of insurance coverage after 
the Policy has been in force during the insured's lifetime for two years from   
the effective date of any increase. Any contest of an increase in the specified 
amount of insurance coverage will be based on the application for that increase.
Optional benefit riders to the Policy may have separate incontestability        
provisions.                                                                     

TELEPHONE TRANSACTIONS                                        

Telephone Transactions Permitted                                                
o    Transfers among investment options.                                        
o    Establish systematic transfer programs.                                    
o    Change premium allocations.                                                

How to Authorize Telephone Transactions                                         
o    Upon your authorization on the Policy application or in Written Notice to  
    us, you, your registered representative or a third person named by you may
     do telephone transactions on your behalf. You bear the risk of the accuracy
of any designated person's instructions to us.                        

Telephone Transaction Rules                                                     
o    Must be received by close of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (usually 
    3 p.m. Central Time); if later, the transaction will be processed the next
 day the NYSE is open. Rydex Subaccount transactions must be received by
2:30 p.m. Central Time for same day processing.                       
o    Calls will be recorded for your protection.                                
o    For security, you or your authorized designee must provide your Social     
Security number and/or other identification information.              
o    May be discontinued at any time as to some or all Owners.                  

We are not liable for following telephone transaction instructions we reasonably
believe to be genuine.

LAPSE AND GRACE PERIOD                                                          

o        Lapse                                                                  

      Because Policy value can fluctuate depending upon the performance of
your selected variable investment options, your Policy can lapse, even if you   
pay all Planned Periodic Premiums on time.                                      

         This Policy will lapse with no value when Policy's Cash Surrender Value
is not enough to cover any due but unpaid charges. However, this Policy will not
terminate during a grace period as long as sufficient premium is paid by the end
of the grace period to prevent lapse.                                           

 Lapse of the Policy may result in adverse tax consequences.

o        Guaranteed Death Benefit                                               

      We guarantee the Policy will not lapse during its first three Policy
Years so long as the Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium, adjusted for partial     
withdrawals and outstanding loan and loan interest, is paid, even if the Cash   
Surrender Value is not enough to pay Policy charges due. This feature may be    
modified or not available in all states.                                        
        o    If the Policy does lapse, the Guaranteed Death Benefit ends and
           is not reinstated even if the underlying Policy is reinstated
after a grace period;                             
        o    Increases in specified amount of insurance will be reflected in
       the Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium requirement from the
effective date of the change; and                 
          o    Policy premiums paid to date, minus partial withdrawals since the
               Policy Date, and minus outstanding Policy loans and loan interest
          charged, must meet or exceed the cumulative Guaranteed Death
Benefit Premium required to date.                 

o        Grace Period                                                           

     If your Policy lapses, we allow you a 61-day grace period to make a
premium payment in order to continue the Policy. The grace period begins on the 
date we mail a notice of the premium necessary to keep this Policy in force. We 
will mail this notice to you at your current address on record with us and to   
any assignee on record. Insurance coverage continues during the grace period,   
but the Policy has no value for purposes of Policy loans, surrenders or         
transfers. If sufficient premium is not paid by the end of the grace period, the
Policy will terminate without value as of the first day of the grace period. If 
the insured dies during the grace period, we will deduct outstanding Policy debt
and Policy charges due but not paid from the death benefit proceeds payable.    

REINSTATEMENT                                                 

        If the Policy lapses because a grace period ended without a sufficient
payment being made, you may reinstate it within three years of the date of      
lapse. To reinstate, we must receive:                                           

o    Written application signed by you and the insured;     
       o    Evidence of the insured's insurability satisfactory to us, and
               the insurability of any insured covered under an optional benefit
rider;                                            
o    Premium at least equal to the greater of:              
               (1)  An amount sufficient to bring the Cash Surrender Value after
                   the first monthly deduction to an amount greater than zero;
or                                      
            (2)  Three times the current Policy Month's monthly deduction.

         If any outstanding Policy loan is reinstated, that debt will be held in
our Fixed Account.                                                              

         The effective date of reinstatement will be the Policy Month date on or
next following the date the reinstatement is approved.                          

  The specified amount of the reinstated Policy may not exceed the
specified amount at the time of lapse. The Policy value on the effective date of
reinstatement will equal the Policy value as of the date of lapse. The surrender
charge at reinstatement, if any, will be based on the current Policy Year as if 
the Policy had never terminated. Any Guaranteed Death Benefit cannot be         
reinstated.                                                                     

     The Policy cannot be reinstated once it has been fully surrendered.

DELAY OF PAYMENTS OR TRANSFERS                                

        We will usually pay any amounts from the Separate Account requested as
a partial withdrawal or cash surrender within seven days after we receive your  
Written Notice. We can postpone such payments or any transfers out of a         
Subaccount if: (i) the NYSE is closed for other than customary weekend and      
holiday closings; (ii) trading on the NYSE is restricted; (iii) an emergency    
exists as determined by the SEC, as a result of which it is not reasonably      
practical to dispose of securities, or not reasonably practical to determine the
value of the net assets of the Separate Account; or (iv) the SEC permits delay  
for the protection of security holders. The applicable rules of the SEC will    
govern as to whether the conditions in (iii) or (iv) exist.                     

     We may defer payments of a full or partial surrender from the Fixed
Account for up to six months from the date we receive your Written Notice       
requesting the surrender.                                                       

BENEFICIARY                                                   

         You may change your beneficiary by sending Written Notice to us, unless
the named beneficiary is irrevocable. Once we record and acknowledge the change,
it is effective as of the date you signed the Written Notice. The change will   
not apply to any payments made or other action taken by us before recording. If 
the named beneficiary is irrevocable, you may change the named beneficiary only 
by Written Notice signed by both you and the beneficiary. If more than one named
beneficiary is designated, and you fail to specify their interest, they will    
share equally.                                                                  

   If the named beneficiary dies before you, then your estate is the
beneficiary until you name a new beneficiary.                                   

     The interest of any beneficiary is subject to that of any assignee.

MINOR OWNER OR BENEFICIARY                                    

       Generally (and except as provided for in some states) a minor may not
own the Policy solely in the minor's name and cannot receive payments directly  
as a Policy beneficiary. Contrary to common belief, in most states parental     
status does not automatically give parents the power to provide an adequate     
release to us to make beneficiary payments to the parent for the minor's        
benefit. A minor can "own" a Policy through the trustee of a trust established  
for the minor's benefit, or through the minor's named and court appointed       
guardian, who owns the Policy in his or her capacity as trustee or guardian.    
Where a minor is a named beneficiary, we are able to pay the minor's beneficiary
payments to the minor's trustee or guardian. Some states allow us to make such  
payments up to a limited amount directly to parents. Parents seeking to have a  
minor's interest made payable to them for the minor's benefit are encouraged to 
check with their local court to determine the process to be appointed as the    
minor's guardian; it is often a very simple process that can be accomplished    
without the assistance of an attorney. If there is no adult representative able 
to give us an adequate release for payment of the minor's beneficiary interest, 
we will retain the minor's interest on deposit until the minor attains the age  
of majority.                                                                    

POLICY CHANGES                                                

        Any change to your Policy is only effective if on a form acceptable to
us, and then only once it is received at our Service Center and recorded on our 
records. Information on how to contact us to determine what information is      
needed and where you can get various forms for Policy changes is shown on this  
prospectus' first and last pages.                                               

"FREE LOOK" RIGHTS                                            

    Most states give you a limited period of time within which you can
cancel your Policy, usually called a "right to examine" or "free look" period.  
The amount we will refund if you cancel during this period varies, but will     
always be at least the amount required by the state whose law governs your      
Policy. The specific terms of your state's "free look" requirements are on the  
front page of your Policy.                                                      

OPTIONAL FEATURES                                             

        Subject to certain requirements, one or more of the optional insurance
benefits described in APPENDIX A - OPTIONAL FEATURES may be added to your Policy
by rider. The cost of any optional insurance benefit will be deducted monthly   
from Policy value as stated in this prospectus' CHARGES section.

POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS 

        The principle purpose of the Policy is to provide a death benefit upon
the insured's death, but before then you may also borrow against the Policy's   
Cash Surrender Value, take a partial withdrawal, or fully surrender it for its  
Cash Surrender Value. Tax penalties and surrender charges may apply to amounts  
taken out of your Policy.                                                       

DEATH BENEFIT                                                 

  Upon the insured's death, we will pay to the Policy beneficiary:
          (a)  the death benefit on the insured's life,  determined as described
below; plus                                       
          (b)  any additional life insurance  proceeds  provided by any optional
benefit or rider; minus                           
(c)  any outstanding Policy debt; minus                     
          (d)  any due and unpaid Policy charges,  including  deductions for the
month of death.                                   

A death benefit is payable upon:                                                
-  Your Policy being in force;                                      
-  Our receipt of Due Proof of Death of the Insured;                
     -  Our receipt of sufficient beneficiary information to make the payment;
and                                                           
-  Your election of a payment option.                               
"Due Proof of Death" is generally a certified copy of a death certificate, a    
certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the       
finding of death, or any other proof satisfactory to us.                        

      We will pay the death benefit after we receive Due Proof of Death of
the insured's death and as soon thereafter as we have sufficient information    
about the beneficiary to make the payment. Death benefits may be paid pursuant  
to a payment option to the extent allowed by applicable law and any settlement  
agreement in effect at the insured's death. If neither you nor the beneficiary  
makes a payment option election within 60 days of our receipt of Due Proof of   
Death, we will issue a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary.                     

o        Death Benefit Options                                                  
        You may choose one of two death benefit options. Option A is in effect
unless you elect Option B.                                                      

Death Benefit Option A                                                          
   If you prefer to have favorable investment performance, if any, reflected
in higher Policy value rather than increased insurance coverage, you should     
generally select Option A.                                                      

Under Option A, the death benefit is the greater of:                            
     (a)  the specified  amount of insurance  coverage on the insured's  date of
death; or                                                   
     (b)  the Policy  value on the date of death  multiplied  times the corridor
percentage (see below).                                     

Death Benefit Option B                                                          

If you prefer to have favorable investment performance, if any, reflected in    
increased insurance coverage rather than higher Policy value, you should        
generally select Option B.                                                      

Under Option B, the death benefit is the greater of:                            
     (a)  the specified  amount of insurance  coverage on the date of death plus
the Policy value; or                                        
     (b)  the Policy  value on the date of death  multiplied  times the corridor
percentage (see below).

o        Changes in Death Benefit Option                                        
         After the first Policy Year, you may change your Policy's death benefit
option.                                                       

Changes in Death Benefit Option Rules                                           

o    Your request for a change must be by Written Notice.                       

o    You can only change your Policy death benefit option once each Policy Year.
     The change will be effective on the Policy Month date after we receive (or,
   if evidence of insurability is necessary, after we approve) your request.

o    There is no fee to change your Policy death benefit option.                
o    Changing from Option A to Option B: A change from Option A to Option B will
     require satisfactory evidence of insurability.  The death benefit after the
     change  will  equal  the  specified  amount  prior to the  change  plus the
accumulation value as of the date of the change.                      
o    Changing from Option B to Option A: The specified  amount of insurance will
equal the death benefit on the date of the change.                    

     The change is allowed only if the new specified amount of insurance
meets the requirements set forth in the Change in Specified Amount of Insurance 
Coverage section, below.                                                        

o        Change in Specified Amount of Insurance Coverage                       

      You may change the current specified amount of insurance coverage by
Written Notice on a form provided by us, and subject to our approval. A change  
could have federal tax consequences (see this prospectus' TAX MATTERS section). 
Any change will take effect on the Policy Month date on or after the date we    
receive your Written Notice.                                                    

INCREASE () in Coverage Rules                                                   

o    No increase is allowed in the first Policy Year.                           

o    The insured's age nearest birthday must be 80 or younger.                  

o    A new application, evidence of insurability, and additional premium for the
amount of the increase may be required.                               

o    Minimum amount of an increase in specified amount of insurance coverage is 
$25,000.                                                              

o    Cost of insurance charges for the increase will be based upon the insured's
attained age and underwriting class at the time of the increase.      

o    The administrative charge will increase to $9 per month for the 12 months  
following the increase. See this Prospectus' CHARGES section.         

o    Ongoing additional premium may be required to maintain your Policy's       
    Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium requirements. (See this prospectus' OTHER
IMPORTANT POLICY INFORMATION: Lapse and Grace Period provision.)      

o    Additional premium may be required if Policy value at the time of the      
     increase, minus outstanding Policy debt, is less than an amount equal to 12
times what the current monthly deductions from Policy value will be   
reflecting the increase in specified amount of insurance coverage.    

DECREASE () in Coverage Rules                                                   

o    No decrease is allowed in the first Policy Year nor during the first 12    
Policy Months following an increase in specified amount of insurance  
     coverage except for a decrease which is the result of a partial withdrawal.
o    The specified amount of coverage after the decrease must be at least:      
-    $100,000 in the first three Policy Years, and                    
-    $75,000 in the 4th and subsequent Policy Years.                  
o    We may limit any requested decrease to the amount necessary to keep the    
 Policy in compliance with maximum premium limits under federal tax law.
o    A decrease will not lower the Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium in effect at
the time of the decrease.

MATURITY DATE                                                 

         The Policy's normal maturity date is the Policy anniversary nearest the
insured's 100th birthday. On the maturity date, we will pay you the Policy      
value, less any loan and unpaid loan interest, if the insured is then living, if
this Policy is in force, and you have not elected to extend the Policy's        
maturity date. The Policy may terminate prior to the maturity date as described 
under the Lapse and Grace Period provision. If the Policy does continue in force
to the maturity date, it is possible there will be little or no Policy value at 
that time.                                                                      

o        Coverage Beyond Maturity                                               

    At least 90 days before the Policy's normal maturity date, you may
elect to continue the Policy in force beyond the normal maturity date for as    
long as the Policy value is greater than zero. The election must be made by     
Written Notice, upon which we will issue you, at no additional cost, an Extended
Maturity Rider; this rider is not available in all states. The following will   
apply:                                                                          

o    The death benefit will be the Policy value.                      

o    You cannot pay any more premiums.                                

   o    The insured's date of death will be considered the Policy's maturity
      date, except that this rider does not extend the maturity date for
purposes of determining benefits under any other riders.    

  o    We will maintain your allocation of Policy value to the Subaccounts
and the Fixed Account according to your instructions.       

o    No monthly charges will be made for cost of insurance or riders. 

The tax consequences of extending the maturity date are unclear. Please consult 
a tax adviser.                                                                  

      Some States may require that your Policy mature as of a certain date
(usually the Policy Anniversary nearest your 100th birthday), or limit your     
benefits and the charges we may collect for your coverage after such date. See  
your Policy language for detailed information about benefits at age 100 and     
beyond.                                                                         

POLICY LOANS                                                  

        If you ask, your sales representative or we may be able to provide you

Surrender Value and death benefit. Any loan transaction will permanently affect 
Policy values. Surrender or lapse of a Policy while a loan is outstanding could 
result in significant tax consequences.

          elect) or you have not provided such instructions, we will deduct loan

balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account.          
   o    If Policy debt exceeds Policy value minus the surrender charge minus
        accrued expenses and charges, you must pay the excess or your Policy

     o    All or part of a loan may be repaid at any time while the Policy is in
        force. We will deduct the amount of the loan repayment from the Loan
        Account and allocate that amount among the Subaccounts and the Fixed
      Account in the same percentages as net premium is allocated on the
        date of repayment. We will treat any amounts you pay us as a premium
unless you specify that it is a loan repayment.             
o    The death benefit will be reduced by the amount of any loan      
     outstanding and unpaid loan interest on the date of the insured's

FULL SURRENDER                                                

       While the insured is alive, you may terminate the Policy for its Cash
Surrender Value. Following a full surrender, all your rights in the Policy end, 
and the Policy may not be reinstated.                                           

Full Surrender Rules                                          
          o    We will accept a full surrender request signed by you on our form
               of Written Notice by mail or facsimile. However, when accepting a
               request by a method not requiring an original signature, there is
            a greater possibility that unauthorized persons can manipulate
       your signature and make changes on your Policy (including
withdrawals) without your knowledge.              
          o    Surrenders may be taxable, and a 10% federal tax penalty on gains
           may apply prior to age 59 1/2. See the TAX MATTERS section of
this prospectus for more information.             
         o    We may defer surrender payments from the Fixed Account for up to
six months from the date we receive your request. 

PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL                                            

        While the insured is alive, you may withdraw part of the Policy value.
The amount requested and any partial withdrawal charge will usually be deducted 
from the Policy value on the date we receive your request if received before 3  
p.m. Central Time. The Policy value will be reduced by the amount of the partial
withdrawal, but the specified amount of insurance coverage will not change.     

    If Death Benefit Option A (described above) is in effect, then the
current specified amount of insurance coverage as well as Policy value will be  
reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal.                                

      If Death Benefit Option B (described above) is in effect, the Policy
value will be reduced by the amount of the partial surrender, but the specified 
amount of insurance coverage will not change.                                   

Partial Withdrawal Rules                                                        
o    We will accept a partial withdrawal request signed by you on our form of   
     Written Notice by mail or facsimile. However, when accepting a request by a
    method not requiring an original signature, there is a greater possibility
     that unauthorized persons can manipulate your signature and make changes on
your Policy (including withdrawals) without your knowledge.           
o    The applicable Partial Withdrawal Charge is described in your Policy and   
the CHARGES section of this prospectus.                               
o    The minimum partial withdrawal amount is $500; the maximum is an amount    
  such that remaining Cash Surrender Value is at least $1,000 or an amount
    sufficient to maintain the Policy in force for the next 12 months, and the
specified amount of insurance coverage after the withdrawal must be at
least:                                                                
-    $100,000 in the first three Policy Years, and                    
-    $75,000 in the 4th and subsequent Policy Years.                  
o    A partial withdrawal is irrevocable.                                       
o    For tax purposes, partial withdrawals are treated as made first from       
premiums paid and then from earnings, beginning with the most recent  
premium payment, unless the Policy is a modified endowment contract.  
o    Partial withdrawals will be deducted from your Policy investment options on
a pro rata basis, unless you instruct us otherwise. If the value of an
    investment option after a withdrawal pursuant to your instructions is less
than $100, the amounts will be deducted on a pro rata basis.          
o    Partial withdrawals result in cancellation of Accumulation Units from each 
applicable Subaccount.                                                
o    We reserve the right to defer withdrawal payments from the Fixed Account   
for up to six months from the date we receive your request.           
o    Partial withdrawals may change the Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium        
   requirements. You may request a new illustration of policy values from us
to demonstrate these changes.                                         
o    Depending upon the circumstances, a partial withdrawal may have tax        
consequences.

PAYMENT OF POLICY PROCEEDS                                    

     A primary function of a life insurance policy is to provide payment
options for payment of Policy proceeds in a way that best benefits the payee.   
Policy proceeds are payable upon the insured's death, a full surrender or       
partial withdrawal of Policy value, or upon any other benefit where certain     
proceeds are payable. You may elect to have Policy proceeds paid under one of   
several payment options or as a lump sum. If another option is not chosen within
60 days of the date we receive satisfactory proof of the insured's death, we    
will make payment in a lump sum to the beneficiary.                             

Rules for Payment of Policy Proceeds                          
          o    You, or your beneficiary after your death if you are the insured,
            may elect a payment option by completing an election form that
can be requested from us at any time.             
     o    Payees must be individuals who receive payments in their own
behalf unless otherwise agreed to by us.          
       o    An association, corporation, partnership or fiduciary can only
          receive a lump sum payment or a payment under a fixed period
payment option (Death Benefit Option C).          
        o    Any payment option chosen will be effective when we acknowledge
it.                                               
   o    We may require proof of your age or survival or the age or
survival of the payee.                            
          o    We reserve the right to pay the proceeds in one lump sum when the
           amount is less than $5,000, or when the payment option chosen
         would result in periodic payments of less than $100. If any
          payment would be or becomes less than $100, we also have the
           right to change the frequency of payments to an interval that
           will result in payments of at least $100. In no event will we
       make payments under a payment option less frequently than
annually.                                         
      o    No payee may commute, encumber or alienate any proceeds under
         this Policy before they are due. No proceeds are subject to
 attachment for any debt or obligation of any payee.
          o    When the last payee dies, we will pay to the estate of that payee
               any amount on deposit, or the then present value of any remaining
guaranteed payments under a fixed payment option. 

        Payments under the payment options are fixed payments based on a fixed
rate of interest at or higher than the minimum effective annual rate which is   
guaranteed to yield 3% on an annual basis. Proceeds to fund payments are        
transferred to our general account and are no longer a part of the Separate     
Account. We have sole discretion whether or not to pay a higher interest rate   
for payment options A, B, C, D or E (see below). Current single premium         
immediate annuity rates for options D or E are used if higher than the          
guaranteed amounts (guaranteed amounts are based upon the tables contained in   
the Policy). Current interest rates, and further information, may be obtained   
from us. The amount of each fixed annuity payment is set and begins on the date 
payment of Policy proceeds is to begin, and does not change.                    

o        Selecting a Payment Option                                             

  Once fixed payments under a payment option begin, they cannot be
changed. (We may allow the beneficiary to transfer amounts applied under options
A to C to options D to F after the date payment of Policy proceeds begins.      
However, we reserve the right to discontinue this practice.)                    

The longer the guaranteed or projected payment option period, the lower the     
amount of each payment.                                                         

       Note: If you elect payment options D or E and select a non-guaranteed
period, it is possible that only one annuity payment would be made under the    
payment option if the person whose life the payment is based upon (the          
"measuring life") dies before the due date of the second payment, only two      
payments would be made if the "measuring life" died before the due date of the  
third payment, etc.                                                             

The payment options for receiving Policy proceeds are:        

A.   Interest Payment. We will pay interest each month at a rate determined by  
us on the amount retained.                                            

B.   Payments for a Fixed Amount. Proceeds are paid in equal monthly            
     installments until proceeds, with interest, have been fully paid. The total
annual payment must be at least 5% of the amount retained.            

C.   Payments for a Fixed Period. Proceeds are paid in equal monthly            
installments for the specified period chosen not to exceed 20 years.  
  Monthly incomes for each $1,000 of proceeds, which include interest, are
illustrated by a table in the Policy.                                 

D.   Lifetime Income. Proceeds are paid as equal monthly installments based on  
   the life of a named person, and continue for the lifetime of that person.
   Variations provide for guaranteed payments for a period of time or a lump
sum refund.                                                           

E.   Joint and Last Survivor Lifetime Income. Proceeds are paid as equal monthly
   installments during the joint lives of two individuals and until the last
     of them dies. Variations provide for a reduced amount of payment during the
lifetime of the surviving person.                                     

F.   Lump Sum. Proceeds are paid in one sum.

       In most cases, when death benefit proceeds are paid in a lump sum, we
will pay the death benefit proceeds by establishing an interest bearing account 
for the beneficiary, in the amount of the death benefit proceeds payable. The   
same interest rate schedule and other account terms will apply to all           
beneficiary accounts in place at any given time. We will send the beneficiary a 
checkbook within 7 days after we receive all the required documents, and the    
beneficiary will have immediate access to the account simply by writing a check 
for all or any part of the amount of the death benefit proceeds payable. The    
account is part of our general account. It is not a bank account and it is not  
insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As part of our general      
account, it is subject to the claims of our creditors. We receive a benefit from
all amounts left in the general account.                                        

TAX MATTERS                                                                     

        The following is only general information about federal tax law and is
not intended as tax advice to any individual. Tax laws affecting the Policy are 
complex, may change and are affected by your facts and circumstances. We cannot 
guarantee the tax treatment of the Policy or any transaction involving the      
Policy. You should consult your own tax adviser as to how these general rules   
and any applicable taxes will apply to you if you purchase a Policy.            

LIFE INSURANCE QUALIFICATION; TAX TREATMENT OF DEATH BENEFIT  

   The Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code") defines a life
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes. This definition can be met  
if an insurance contract satisfies either one of two tests. The Code and related
regulations do not directly address the manner in which these tests should be   
applied to certain features of the Policy. Thus, there is some uncertainty about
how those tests apply to the Policy.                                            

   Nevertheless, we believe the Policy qualifies as a life insurance
contract for federal tax purposes, so that:                                     

o    The death benefit should be fully excludable from the  
beneficiary's gross income; and                   
         o    You should not be considered in constructive receipt of the Cash
               Surrender Value, including any increases in Cash Surrender Value,
          unless and until it is distributed from the Policy. However,
             Congress has recently enacted new statutory provisions relating
         to employer owned life insurance. The death benefit of life
               insurance owned by an employer is taxable unless the insured is a
         certain class of employee and has been given notice and has
   consented to coverage on his life. Specific statutory
              requirements must be satisfied for the death benefit of employer
          owned life insurance to be excluded from taxable income. Any
              employer contemplating the purchase of a life insurance contract
should consult a tax advisor.                     

    We reserve the right to make such changes in the Policy as we deem
necessary to assure it qualifies as a life insurance contract under the Code and
continues to provide the tax benefits of such qualification.                    

    Modified Endowment Contracts. The Code establishes a class of life
insurance contracts designated as modified endowment contracts. Distributions   
from a modified endowment contract are taxed under different rules most notably 
distributions are treated as from income first (to the extent of any gain in the
contract) then from cost basis. There are other differences related modified    
endowment contracts, such as loans being treated as a distribution (see Tax     
Treatment of Loans and Other Distributions below). The Code rules governing     
whether a Policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract are extremely 
complex. In general, a Policy is a modified endowment contract if the           
accumulated premium payments made at any time during the first seven Policy     
Years exceed the sum of the net level premium payments which would have been    
paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paid-up future benefits  
after the payment of seven level annual premiums. A Policy may also become a    
modified endowment contract because of a material change. The determination of  
whether a Policy is a modified endowment contract after a material change       
generally depends upon the relationship of the Policy's death benefit and Policy
value at the time of such change and the additional premium payments made       
in the seven years following the material change. A Policy may also become a    
modified endowment contract if the death benefit is reduced.                    

This Policy's flexibility and how you tailor it to meet your needs could cause  
it to be a modified endowment contract. We recommend you consult with a tax     
adviser to determine if desired Policy transactions may cause such treatment.   
When a premium payment is credited which we believe causes the Policy to become 
a modified endowment contract, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity 
to request a refund of that premium in order to avoid such treatment. You have  
30 days after receiving such a notice to request the refund.

P-->485APOS28th�Page�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
       A Policy issued in exchange for a modified endowment contract is also
treated as a modified endowment contract. However, we believe that a Policy     
issued in exchange for a life insurance policy that is not a modified endowment 
contract will generally not be treated as a modified endowment contract if the  
death benefit of the Policy is greater than or equal to the death benefit of the
Policy being exchanged. The payment of any premiums at the time of or after the 
exchange may, however, cause the Policy to become a modified endowment contract.
You may, of course, choose to not make additional payments in order to prevent a
Policy from being treated as a modified endowment contract.                     

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CORPORATIONS AND EMPLOYERS         

Premium paid by a business for a life insurance Policy is not 
deductible as a business expense or otherwise if the business is directly or    
indirectly a beneficiary of the Policy. For purposes of the alternative minimum 
tax ("AMT") that may be imposed on corporations, the death benefit from the     
Policy, even though excluded from gross income for normal tax purposes, is      
included in "adjusted current earnings" for AMT purposes. In addition, although 
increases to the Policy's cash surrender value are generally excluded from gross
income for normal income tax purposes, such increases are included in adjusted  
current earnings for income tax purposes.                                       

     In 2006, Congress adopted new rules relating to Employer Owned Life
Insurance. Any employer contemplating the purchase of a new life insurance      
contract or a change in an existing contract should consult a tax adviser       
regarding the Employee Notice and Consent requirements to avoid the income      
taxation of the life insurance death benefits.                                  

TAX TREATMENT OF LOANS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS                

      Upon a surrender or lapse of the Policy, if the amount received plus
any outstanding Policy debt exceeds the total cost basis in the Policy, the     
excess will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax, regardless  
of whether a Policy is or is not a modified endowment contract. However, the tax
consequences of distributions from, and loans taken from or secured by, a Policy
depend on whether the Policy is classified as a modified endowment contract.    

"Cost Basis in the Policy" means:                                               
      -  the total of any premium payments or other consideration paid for the
Policy, minus                                               
-  any withdrawals previously recovered that were not taxable.    

Distributions from Policies Classified as Modified Endowment Contracts are      
subject to the following tax rules:                                             
1)   All distributions, including surrenders and partial withdrawals, are       
 treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the
 excess (if any) of the Policy value immediately before the distribution
over the cost basis in the Policy at such time.                       
2)   Loans from or secured by the Policy are treated as distributions and taxed 
     accordingly. If you do not repay loan interest, the loan interest itself is
treated as a distribution.                                            
3)   A 10% additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution  
from, or loan taken from or secured by, the Policy that is included in
    income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the Owner
     attains age 59 1/2, is attributable to the Owner's becoming disabled, or is
    part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life (or
life expectancy) of the Owner or the joint lives (or joint life       
expectancies) of the Owner and the Owner's beneficiary.               

Distributions from Policies Not Classified as Modified Endowment Contracts are  
generally treated as first recovering the cost basis in the Policy and then,    
only after the return of all such cost basis in the Policy, as distributing     
taxable income. An exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a       
decrease in the Policy's death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits
under the Policy in the first 15 years after the Policy is issued and that      
results in a cash distribution to the Owner in order for the Policy to continue 
complying with the Code's definition of life insurance. Such a cash distribution
will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income (to the extent of any gain 
in the Policy).                                                                 

      Loans from, or secured by, a Policy that is not a modified endowment
contract are not treated as distributions. However, it is possible that reduced 
rate loans could be treated as distributions rather than loans.                 

         Distributions (including upon surrender) and loans from, or secured by,
a Policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not subject to the 10%   
additional income tax rule. If a Policy which is not now but later becomes a    
modified endowment contract because of a reduction in benefits, then any        
distributions made from the Policy within two years prior to the change will    
become taxable pursuant to modified endowment contract rules.

OTHER POLICY OWNER TAX MATTERS                                                  

    Depending on the circumstances, the exchange of a Policy, a Policy
loan, a partial or full surrender, a lapse, a change in ownership, or an        
assignment of the Policy may have federal income tax consequences. In addition, 
federal, state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or    
receipt of distributions from a Policy depend on the circumstances of each      
Owner or beneficiary.                                                           

Interest paid on Policy loans generally is not tax deductible.

      Aggregation of modified endowment contracts. Pre-death distributions
(including a loan, partial surrender, collateral assignment or full surrender)  
from a Policy that is treated as a modified endowment contract may require a    
special aggregation to determine the amount of income recognized on the Policy. 
If we or any of our affiliates issue more than one modified endowment contract  
to the same Policy Owner within any 12-month period, then for purposes of       
measuring the income on the Policy with respect to a distribution from any of   
those Policies, the income for all those Policies will be aggregated and        
attributed to that distribution.                                                

     Federal and state estate, inheritance and other tax consequences of
ownership or receipt of proceeds under the Policy depend upon your or the       
beneficiary's individual circumstance.                                          

        Diversification requirements. Investments of the Separate Account must
be "adequately diversified" for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance       
contract under the Code. Any failure to comply with diversification requirements
could subject you to immediate taxation on the incremental increases in Policy  
value plus the cost of insurance protection for the year. However, we believe   
the Policy complies fully with such requirements.                               

       Owner control. The Treasury Department stated that it anticipates the
issuance of regulations or rulings prescribing the circumstances in which your  
control of the investments of the Separate Account may cause you, rather than   
us, to be treated as the owner of the assets in the Separate Account. To date,  
no such regulations or guidance has been issued. If you are considered the Owner
of the assets of the Separate Account, income and gains from the Separate       
Account would be included in your gross income.                                 

        The ownership rights under the Policy are similar to, but different in
certain respects from, those described by the IRS in rulings in which it        
determined that owners were not owners of separate account assets. For example, 
you have additional flexibility in allocating Policy premium and Policy values. 
These differences could result in you being treated as the owner of a pro rata  
share of the assets of the Separate Account. In addition, we do not know what   
standards will be set forth in the regulations or rulings which the Treasury may
issue. We therefore reserve the right to modify the Policy as necessary to      
attempt to prevent you from being considered the Owner of the assets of the     
Separate Account.                                                               

Tax-advantaged arrangements. The Policy may be used in various
arrangements, including non-qualified deferred compensation or salary           
continuance plans, split dollar insurance plans, executive bonus plans, tax     
exempt and nonexempt welfare benefit plans, retiree medical benefit plans and   
others. The tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular 
facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement. If you are contemplating
the use of the Policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on  
its tax consequences, you should be sure to consult a qualified tax adviser     
regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement and the suitability  
of this Policy for the arrangement.

DEFINED TERMS 

Accumulation Units are an accounting unit of measure used to calculate the      
Policy value allocated to Subaccounts of the Separate Account. It is similar to 
a share of a mutual fund. The Policy describes how Accumulation Units are       
calculated.                                                                     

Business Day is each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.  

Cash Surrender Value is the total Policy value less outstanding loans and loan  
interest, less any applicable surrender charge, and less any due but unpaid     
Policy charges.                                                                 

Fixed Account is an account that credits a fixed rate of interest guaranteed by 
us and is not affected by the experience of the variable investment options of  
the Separate Account. The Fixed Account is part of our general account.         

Guaranteed Death Benefit is the initial specified amount of insurance guaranteed
for the first three Policy Years so long as minimum premium is paid, and any    
other longer period provided by an optional guaranteed death benefit rider.     

Loan Account is an account we maintain for your Policy if you have a Policy loan
outstanding. The Loan Account is credited with interest and is not affected by  
the experience of the variable investment options of the Separate Account. The  
Loan Account is part of our general account.                                    

Owner, You, Your is you -- the person(s) or legal entity who may exercise all   
rights and privileges under the Policy. If there are joint Owners, the          
signatures of both Owners are needed to exercise rights under the Policy.       

Policy Date is the effective date for Policy coverage. It is usually, but need  
not be, the same as the date the Policy is issued.                              

Policy Year/Month/Anniversary is measured from respective anniversary dates of  
the Policy Date of your Policy.                                                 

Premium                                                                         

 Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium is the amount of premium which, if paid in
advance, will keep your Policy in force during any guaranteed death benefit     
period so long as other Policy provisions are met, even if the Cash Surrender   
Value is zero or less.                                                          
  Minimum Initial Premium is equal to 25% of the first year monthly deductions
including charges for riders, and any substandard risk adjustments for the level
of initial specified amount of life insurance coverage you select.              
Planned Periodic Premium is a schedule of equal premiums payable at fixed 
intervals chosen by you, the Owner. You need not follow this schedule, nor will 
following it ensure that the Policy will remain in force unless the payments    
meet the requirements of the minimum premium or Guaranteed Death Benefit        
Premium.                                                                        

Subaccount is a variable investment option division within the Separate Account 
for which Accumulation Units are separately maintained. Each Subaccount         
corresponds to a single, underlying, non-publicly traded portfolio issued       
through a series fund.                                                          

Valuation Period is the period commencing at the close of business of the New   
York Stock Exchange on each Business Day and ending at the close of business on 
the next succeeding Business Day.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICY                                    

         Our underwriter, AIC, enters into contracts with various broker-dealers
("Distributors") to distribute Policies. These Distributors are registered with 
the SEC and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. All     
persons selling the Policy must be registered representatives of the            
Distributors, and must also be licensed as insurance agents to sell variable    
insurance products. There is no premium load to cover sales and distribution    
expenses. All compensation or expense reimbursement received by AIC for serving 
as principal underwriter of the Policies will be paid by us from our other      
assets or surplus in our general account, which may include profits derived from
other charges made under the Policies. Policies can be purchased directly from  
us through our direct consumer services, with salaried employees who are        
registered representatives of AIC and who will not receive compensation related 
to the purchase.                                                                

     o    Low-Load Survivorship Variable Universal Life: During the first Policy
         Year, compensation may equal an amount up to 15% of first year target
        premium paid plus the first year cost of any riders and 2% of excess
first year premium.                                         

     o    Low-Load Variable Life: During the first Policy Year, compensation may
       equal an amount up to 9% of first year target premium paid plus the
         first year cost of any riders and 2% of excess first year premium. In
years thereafter, we may pay the broker-dealer asset-based  
         compensation at an annualized rate of 0.1% per Policy Year of the net
Cash Surrender Value.                                       

      Compensation arrangements may vary among broker-dealers. We may also
pay other distribution expenses such as production incentive bonuses. These     
distribution expenses do not result in any additional charges under the Policy  
other than those described in the prospectus' CHARGES section.                  

MORE INFORMATION ON CHARGES                                   

o        Waiver of Certain Charges                                              
         When the Policy is sold in a manner that results in savings of sales or
administrative expenses, we reserve the right to waive all or part of any fee we
charge under the Policy (excluding charges charged by the portfolios). Factors  
we consider include one or more of the following: size and type of group to whom
the Policy is issued; amount of expected premiums; relationship with us         
(employee of us or an affiliated company, receiving distributions or making     
transfers from other policies we or one of our affiliates issue, or transferring
amounts held under qualified retirement plans we or one of our affiliates       
sponsor); type and frequency of administrative and sales services provided; or  
level of annual maintenance fee and withdrawal charges. Any fee waiver will not 
discriminate unfairly against protected classes of individuals and will be done 
according to our rules in effect at the time the Policy is issued. We reserve   
the right to change these rules. The right to waive any charges may be subject  
to State approval.

o        Underwriting Procedure                                                 
      The Policy's cost of insurance depends upon the insured's sex, issue
age, risk class, and length of time the Policy has been in force. The rates will
vary depending upon tobacco use and other risk factors. Guaranteed cost of      
insurance rates are based on the insured's attained age and are equal to the    
1980 Insurance Commissioners Standard Ordinary Male and Female Mortality Tables 
without smoker distinction. The maximum rates for the table-rated substandard   
insureds are based on a multiple (shown in the schedule pages of the Policy) of 
the above rates. We may add flat extra ratings to reflect higher mortality risk.
Any change in the cost of insurance rates will apply to all insureds of the same
age, gender, risk class and whose Policies have been in effect for the same     
length of time.                                                                 

      The cost of insurance rates, Policy charges, and payment options for
Policies issued in Montana, and perhaps other states or in connection with      
certain employee benefit arrangements, are issued on a gender-neutral (unisex)  
basis. The unisex rates will be higher than those applicable to females and     
lower than those applicable to males.                                           

 If the rating class for any increase in the specified amount of
insurance coverage is not the same as the rating class at issue, the cost of    
insurance rate used after such increase will be a composite rate based upon a   
weighted average of the rates of the different rating classes. Decreases may be 
reflected in the cost of insurance rate, as discussed earlier.                  

     The actual charges made during the Policy year will be shown in the
annual report delivered to Policy owners.                                       

DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS                                     

     We will distribute proxy statements, updated prospectuses and other
materials to you from time to time. In order to achieve cost savings, we may    
send consolidated mailings to several owners with the same last name who share a
common address or post office box.                                              

ADVERTISING                                                   

     From time to time, we may advertise performance information for the
Subaccounts and their underlying portfolios. We may also advertise ratings,     
rankings or other information related to us, the Subaccounts or the underlying  
portfolios.                                                                     

 We may provide hypothetical illustrations of Policy value, Cash
Surrender Value and death benefit based on historical investment returns of the 
underlying portfolios for a sample Policy based on assumptions as to age, sex   
and risk class of the insured, and other Policy-specific assumptions.           

We may also provide individualized hypothetical illustrations 
calculated in the same manner as stated above but based upon factors particular 
to your Policy.                                                                 

PERFORMANCE DATA                                              

    From time to time, we may advertise performance for the Subaccount
variable investment options. Performance data is available on our website and is
authorized for use with prospective investors only when accompanied or preceded 
by current product and fund prospectuses containing detailed information about  
the Policy, investment, limitations and risks.                                  

   Performance returns reflect fees and charges assessed by the fund
companies and current mortality and expenses and administrative risk charges    
deducted from separate account assets. Some portfolio advisors have agreed to   
limit their expenses; without these limits, performance would have been lower.  
The returns shown on our website do not reflect the Policy's transaction fees   
and periodic charges. If these fees and charges were deducted, the performance  
quoted would be lower. Yields shown are typically "annualized" yields. This     
means the income generated during the measured seven days is assumed to be      
generated each week over a 52-week period, and not reinvested, and is shown as a
percentage of the investment.

       We encourage you to obtain a personalized illustration which reflects
all charges of the Policy and the impact of those charges upon performance;     
contact your registered representative or us to obtain an illustration, without 
charge, based upon your specific situation. See the Policy prospectus for       
detailed information about Policy charges and portfolio prospectuses for each   
portfolio's expenses.                                                           

      For periods prior to the date the Policy Subaccount began operation,
performance data will be calculated based on the performance of the underlying  
portfolio and the assumption that the Subaccounts were in existence for the same
periods as those indicated for the underlying portfolio with the level of Policy
charges that were in effect at the inception of the Subaccount.                 

    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The return and
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that investor's shares, when 
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.                   

MORNINGSTAR(R) ASSET ALLOCATOR
MODEL ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM
 offered through AMERITAS INVESTMENT CORP. ("AIC")

The Service                                                                     
Ameritas Investment Corp. ("AIC"), an affiliate of ours, has developed several  
asset allocation models, each based on different profiles of an investor's      
willingness to accept investment risk, and marketed exclusively through our     
Policies as the "Morningstar Asset Allocator" program. AIC periodically         
(typically annually) evaluates and updates the models. In developing and        
periodically updating the models, AIC currently relies on the recommendations of
Morningstar Associates, LLC. AIC may change the firm it uses, or, may use no    
independent firm at all.                                                        

If you choose to subscribe to the Morningstar Asset Allocator program, AIC will 
serve as your investment adviser for the service solely for purposes of         
development of the program models and periodic updates of the models.           

If you choose to subscribe to the Morningstar Asset Allocator program, AIC      
instructs us to allocate your initial premium (in the case of a new application)
or accumulated value, as applicable, to the investment options according to the 
model you select, to similarly allocate subsequent premium, and to periodically 
automatically reallocate your accumulated value or premium payments. Your Policy
value will be rebalanced quarterly consistent with your selected model.         

The Morningstar Asset Allocator Models                                          
Development of the Morningstar Asset Allocator models is a two-step process.    
First, an optimization analysis is performed to determine the breakdown of asset
classes. Next, after the asset class exposures are known, a determination is    
made of how available investment options can be used to implement the asset     
class level allocations. The investment options are selected by evaluating the  
asset classes represented by the underlying portfolios and combining investment 
options to arrive at the desired asset class exposure. Investment options are   
selected in a way intended to optimize potential returns for each model, given a
particular level of risk tolerance. This process could, in some cases, result in
the inclusion of an investment option in a model based on its specific asset    
class exposure or other specific optimization factors, even where another       
investment option may have better historical performance.                       

Periodic Updates of the Models and Notices of Updates                           
Each model is evaluated periodically (generally, annually) to assess whether the
combination of investment options within each model should be changed to better 
seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance intended  
for the model. As a result, each model may change, and the investment options   
used within a model may change.                                                 

When your selected model is updated, AIC instructs us to automatically          
reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in        
accordance with any changes to the model you have selected. This means the      
allocation of your accumulated value, and potentially the investment options in 
which you are invested, will automatically change and your accumulated value and
any subsequent premium payments will be automatically reallocated among the     
investment options in your updated model (independently of the automatic        
quarterly rebalancing). AIC requires that you give it discretionary investment  
authority to periodically instruct us to reallocate your accumulated value and  
any subsequent premium payments in accordance with the updated version of the   
model you have selected, if you wish to participate in the Morningstar Asset    
Allocation program.                                                             

ALIC Separate Account LLVL        SAI: 4     Statement of Additional Information

P-->485APOS37th�Page�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
When AIC update the models, we will send you written notice of the updated      
models at least 30 days in advance of the date the updated models are to be     
effective. If you wish to accept the changes in your selected model, you will   
not need to take any action, as your Policy value and any subsequent premium    
will be automatically reallocated pursuant to the updated model. If you do not  
wish to accept the changes to your selected model, you can change to a different
model or withdraw from the Morningstar Asset Allocator program.                 

Risks                                                                           
Although asset allocation models are designed to optimize returns given the     
various levels of risk, there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not   
lose money or that investment results will not experience volatility. Investment
performance of your accumulated value could be better or worse by participating 
in a Morningstar Asset Allocator model than if you had not participated. A model
may perform better or worse than any single investment option or asset class or 
other combinations of investment options or asset classes. Model performance is 
dependent upon the performance of the component investment options (and their   
underlying portfolios). The timing of your investment and the automatic         
quarterly rebalancing may affect performance. Your accumulated value will       
fluctuate, and when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. 

Periodic updating of the models can cause the underlying portfolios to incur    
transaction expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of the portfolios or to
buy securities with money flowing into the portfolios. These expenses can       
adversely affect performance of the pertinent portfolios and the models.        

AIC, an affiliate of ours, may be subject to competing interests that have the  
potential to influence its decision making with regard to the models. In        
addition to its limited role as investment advisor under the Morningstar Asset  
Allocator program, AIC is also compensated by us as principal underwriter for   
the Policies. In addition, AIC receives fees as distributor for the Summit      
Mutual Funds, Inc., Summit Pinnacle Series. We and AIC may receive revenue      
sharing from other portfolios that are available as investment options. AIC may 
have an incentive to use certain portfolios in the models that provide higher   
revenue sharing or distribution fees. AIC may believe that certain portfolios   
may benefit from additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions. All our   
model investment options and their underlying portfolios are analyzed by        
Morningstar Associates, LLC, an independent analytical firm. Neither AIC nor we 
dictate to Morningstar the number of portfolios in a model, the percent that any
portfolio represents in a model, or which portfolios may be selected (other than
to require exclusion of any portfolio that is expected to be liquidated, merged 
into another portfolio, or otherwise closed). AIC and we believe reliance on    
recommendations of Morningstar to develop and update the models reduces or      
eliminates the potential for AIC and us to be influenced by these competing     
interests, but there can be no assurance of this.                               

AIC and we are under no obligation to continue the  Morningstar  Asset Allocator
program,  or any asset  allocation  program,  and have the right to terminate or
change such services at any time.

Item 29.      Indemnification                                                   

Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.'s By-laws provide as follows:                     

The Company shall indemnify any person who was, or is a party, or is threatened 
to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or     
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason  
of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Company or
is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other     
enterprise, against expenses, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines and   
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with  
such action, suit or proceeding to the full extent authorized by the laws of    
Nebraska.                                                                       

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the    
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant   
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission  
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,   
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred 
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the   
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such       
director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate     
jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against      
public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final         
adjudication of such issue.

Policy -- A Survivorship Flexible Premium Variable Universal Life 5900 "O"Street
Insurance Policy issued by Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.                        
                                               P.O. Box 81889/Lincoln, NE 68501
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This prospectus  describes a survivorship  flexible premium  variable  universal
life  insurance  Policy  ("Policy"),  issued by Ameritas  Life  Insurance  Corp.
("Ameritas"),  that pays a death benefit upon the Second Death. Like traditional
life insurance  policies,  a Policy provides Death Benefits to Beneficiaries and
gives you, the Policy  Owner,  the  opportunity  to increase  the Policy's  cash
value. Unlike traditional  policies,  the Policy lets you vary the frequency and
amount of premium payments, rather than follow a fixed premium payment schedule.
It also lets you change the level of Death Benefits as often as once each year. 

A Policy is  different  from  traditional  life  insurance  policies  in another
important  way: you select how Policy  premiums will be invested.  Although each
Policy  Owner is  guaranteed  a minimum  Death  Benefit,  the cash  value of the
Policy,  as well as the actual Death Benefit,  will vary with the performance of
investments you select.                                                         

The  investment   options  available  through  the  Policy  include   investment
portfolios from Neuberger Berman Advisers  Management Trust  ("Neuberger  Berman
AMT"),  Berger  Institutional  Products  Trust ("Berger IPT") and Rydex Variable
Trust ("Rydex") (collectively the "Funds"). Each of these portfolios has its own
investment  objective and policies.  These are described in the prospectuses for
each  investment  portfolio which must accompany this  prospectus.  You may also
choose to allocate premium payments to the Fixed Account managed by Ameritas.   

A Policy will be issued after  Ameritas  accepts a  prospective  Policy  Owner's
application. Generally, an application must specify a Death Benefit no less than
$100,000.  These Policies are available to cover individuals between the ages of
20 and 90 at the time of purchase, although at least one of the individuals must
be no older than 85. A Policy, once purchased,  may generally be canceled within
10 days after you receive it.                                                   

This prospectus is designed to assist you in  understanding  the opportunity and
risks  associated with the purchase of a Policy.  Prospective  Policy Owners are
urged to read the prospectus carefully and retain it for future reference.      

This prospectus includes a summary of the most important features of the Policy,
information  about Ameritas , a list of the  investment  portfolios to which you
may allocate premium  payments,  and a detailed  description of the Policy.  The
appendix to the  prospectus  includes  tables  designed to  illustrate  how cash
values and Death  Benefits  may change  with the  investment  experience  of the
Investment Options.                                                             

This  prospectus  must be accompanied by a prospectus for each of the investment
portfolios available through the Policy.                                        

Although  the  Policy  is  designed  to  provide  life  insurance,  a Policy  is
considered to be a security.  It is not a deposit  with,  an  obligation  of, or
guaranteed  or  endorsed  by any  banking  institution  through  which it may be
purchased,  nor is it insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  the
Federal  Reserve Board,  or any other agency.  The purchase of a Policy involves
investment risk, including the possible loss of principal. For this reason, this
Policy may not be suitable for all  individuals.  It may not be  advantageous to
purchase a Policy as a  replacement  for another type of life  insurance or as a
way to obtain  additional  insurance  protection if the  purchaser  already owns
another survivorship flexible premium variable universal life insurance policy. 

The  Securities   and  Exchange   Commission   ("SEC")   maintains  a  web  site
(http://www.sec.gov)  that contains other information regarding registrants that
file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.                

NEITHER  THE  SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE  COMMISSION  NOR  ANY  STATE  SECURITIES
REGULATORY  AUTHORITY HAS APPROVED  THESE  SECURITIES,  OR DETERMINED  THAT THIS
PROSPECTUS  IS ACCURATE OR  COMPLETE.  ANY  REPRESENTATION  TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

SUMMARY 

The following  summary is intended to highlight the most  important  features of
the Policy that you, as a prospective  Policy Owner,  should consider.  You will
find  more  detailed   information  in  the  main  portion  of  the  prospectus;
cross-references  are  provided  for your  convenience.  Capitalized  terms  are
defined in the glossary that begins on page 3 of this  prospectus.  This summary
and all other parts of this  prospectus  are qualified in their  entirety by the
terms of the Policy, which is available upon request from Ameritas.             

WHO IS THE ISSUER OF A POLICY?                                                  
Ameritas  issues the Policy.  The Policy is available  for  individuals  and for
corporations  and other  institutions  who wish to provide coverage and benefits
for key employees.  A separate  account of Ameritas,  Separate  Account LLVL has
been established to hold the assets supporting the Policy. Separate Account LLVL
has 13 Subaccounts  which  correspond to, and are invested in, the portfolios of
the Funds discussed herein.  (See the section on Ameritas,  the Separate Account
and The Funds.) The financial  statements for Ameritas can be found beginning on
page F-II-1.                                                                    

WHY SHOULD I CONSIDER PURCHASING A POLICY?                                      
The primary  purpose of a Policy is to provide life insurance  protection on the
two Insureds  named in the Policy.  This means that, so long as the Policy is in
force, it will provide for:                                                     
|X| payment of a Death Benefit, which will never be less than the Specified     
Amount the Policy Owner selects (page 22)                               
|X| Policy loan, Surrender and withdrawal features (pages 26-27)                

A Policy also includes an investment component.  This means that, so long as the
Policy is in force,  you will be  responsible  for selecting the manner in which
Net  Premiums  will be invested.  Thus,  the value of a Policy will reflect your
investment choices over the life of the Policy.                                 

HOW DOES THE INVESTMENT COMPONENT OF MY POLICY WORK?                            
Ameritas has established Separate Account LLVL, which is separate from all other
assets of Ameritas,  as a vehicle to receive and invest  premiums  received from
Policy Owners. Separate Account LLVL is divided into separate Subaccounts.  Each
Subaccount  invests  exclusively in shares of one of the  investment  portfolios
available  through  the Policy.  You may  allocate  Net  Premiums to one or more
Subaccounts,  or to Ameritas' Fixed Account in your initial  application.  These
allocations  may be changed by notifying  Ameritas'  Home  Office.  We will only
allow  allocations to Rydex according to  administrative  rules We have set. The
aggregate  value of your interests in the Subaccounts and the Fixed Account will
represent the Accumulation Value of your Policy (See the section on Accumulation
Value.) . Each Policyowner may allocate Net Premiums to one or more Subaccounts,
or to AVLIC's Fixed Account in the initial application. These allocations may be
changed,  without charge, by notifying AVLIC's Home Office.  The aggregate value
of your interests in the  Subaccounts,  the Fixed Account and any amount held in
the General Account to secure Policy debt will represent the Accumulation  Value
of your BRAVO! Policy (page 20).                                                

You may make transfers among the Investment  Options.  All transfers are subject
to the  limits  We set.  We will  only  allow  transfers  with  regard  to Rydex
according to administrative  rules We have set. The Policy's  Accumulation Value
in  Separate  Account  LLVL will  reflect  the amount and  frequency  of premium
payments, the investment experience of

the  chosen  Subaccounts  and the  Fixed  Account,  Policy  loans,  any  partial
withdrawals,  and any charges imposed in connection with the Policy.  The entire
investment risk of Separate Account LLVL is borne by the Policy Owner.  Ameritas
does not guarantee a minimum  Accumulation  Value in Separate Account LLVL. (See
the section on Accumulation Value.) Ameritas does guarantee the Fixed Account.  

What Investment Options are available through the Policy?                       
The  Investment  Options  available  through  the Policy  include 13  investment
portfolios,  each of which is a separate  series of a mutual fund from Neuberger
Berman AMT, Berger IPT and Rydex. These portfolios are:

Details about the  investment  objectives  and policies of each of the available
investment  portfolios,  including  management fees and expenses,  appear in the
section on The Funds.  There is no assurance that these  objectives will be met.
Participation  in Rydex is  subject  to  administrative  rules We have set.  The
Policy  Owner  bears the entire  investment  risk for amounts  allocated  to the
Subaccounts.  In  addition  to the  listed  portfolios,  you may  also  elect to
allocate  Net  Premiums to Ameritas'  Fixed  Account.  (See the section on Fixed
Account.)

HOW DOES THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPONENT OF A POLICY WORK?                         
A Policy  provides  for the payment of a minimum  Death  Benefit upon the Second
Death.  The amount of the minimum Death Benefit -- sometimes  referred to as the
Specified  Amount of your  Policy -- is chosen by you at the time your Policy is
established.  However,  Death Benefit Proceeds -- the actual amount that will be
paid after Ameritas  receives  Satisfactory  Proof of Death -- may vary over the
life of your Policy,  depending on which of the two available  coverage  options
you select.                                                                     

If you choose Option A, the Death Benefit  payable under your Policy will be the
Specified Amount of your Policy or the applicable percentage of its Accumulation
Value,  whichever is greater.  If you choose Option B, the Death Benefit payable
under  your  Policy  will be the  Specified  Amount  of  your  Policy  plus  the
Accumulation Value of your Policy, or if it is higher, the applicable percentage
of the  Accumulation  Value on the Second Death.  In either case, the applicable
percentage  is  established  based on the Attained Age at the Second Death (page
22).                                                                            

ARE THERE ANY RISKS INVOLVED IN OWNING A POLICY?                                
Yes. Over the life of your Policy,  the  Subaccounts  to which you allocate your
premiums will  fluctuate  with changes in the stock market and overall  economic
factors.  These fluctuations will be reflected in the Accumulation Value of your
Policy and may result in loss of principal.  For this reason,  the purchase of a
Policy may not be suitable for all  individuals.  It may not be  advantageous to
purchase a Policy to replace or augment your  existing  insurance  arrangements.
Appendix A includes  tables  illustrating  the impact that  hypothetical  market
returns would have on Accumulation Values under a Policy (page A-1).            

WHAT IS THE PREMIUM THAT MUST BE PAID TO KEEP A POLICY IN FORCE?                
Like  traditional  life  insurance  policies,  a Policy  requires the payment of
periodic  premiums  in order to keep the  Policy in force.  You will be asked to
establish a payment schedule before your Policy becomes effective.              

The distinction  between traditional life policies and a Policy is that a Policy
will not lapse simply  because  premium  payments are not made according to that
payment  schedule.  However,  a Policy will  lapse,  even if  scheduled  premium
payments are made,  if the Net Cash  Surrender  Value of your Policy falls below
zero or premiums paid do not, in the aggregate,  equal the premium  necessary to
satisfy  the  Minimum  Benefit  (page  30)  or  the  Guaranteed   Death  Benefit
requirements (page 30).                                                         

HOW ARE PREMIUMS PAID, PROCESSED AND CREDITED TO ME?                            
Your Policy will be issued after a completed  application  is accepted,  and the
initial premium payment is received,  by Ameritas at its Home Office.  Ameritas'
Home Office is located at 5900 "O" Street,  P.O. Box 81889,  Lincoln,  NE 68501.
Your initial Net Premium will be  allocated  to the Liquid Asset  Portfolio  for
thirteen days after the Issue Date. Then, the  Accumulation  Value of the Policy
will be allocated  among the Subaccounts  and/or the Fixed Account  according to
the instructions in your application.  Where allowed, if you have allocated 100%
to the Fixed  Account,  the Net Premium of the Policy is  allocated to the Fixed
Account on the Issue Date. In this instance,  no further  allocation will occur.
You have the right to  examine  your  Policy  and  return it for a refund  for a
limited time, even after the Issue Date (page 29).                              

You may make  subsequent  premium  payments  according to your Planned  Periodic
Premium  schedule,  although you are not required to do so.  Ameritas  will send
premium payment  notices to you according to any schedule you select,  except if
you pay by automatic bank draft.  When Ameritas receives your premium payment at
its Home  Office,  any  applicable  Percent of Premium  Charge for Taxes will be
deducted and the Net Premium will be  allocated  to the  Subaccounts  and/or the
Fixed Account according to your selections (page 30).                           

As already noted,  provides you  considerable  flexibility  in  determining  the
frequency and amount of premium  payments.  This  flexibility  is not,  however,
unlimited.  You should keep certain  factors in mind in determining  the payment
schedule  that is best  suited to your  needs.  These  include the amount of the
Minimum  Premium,  Guaranteed  Death Benefit  Premium  and/or Net Policy Funding
requirement  needed to keep your  Policy in force  (page  30);  maximum  premium
limitations  established  under the Federal  tax laws (page 30);  and the impact
that reduced

premium  payments may have on the Net Cash Surrender  Value of your Policy (page
30).                                                                            

IS THE ACCUMULATION VALUE OF MY POLICY AVAILABLE WITHOUT SURRENDER?             
Yes. You may access the value of your Policy in one of two ways.  First, you may
obtain a loan,  secured by the  Accumulation  Value of your Policy.  The maximum
interest  rate  on any  such  loan  is 6%  annually;  the  current  rate is 5.5%
annually.  After the tenth Policy Anniversary,  you may borrow against a limited
amount  of the Net Cash  Surrender  Value of your  Policy  at a  maximum  annual
interest rate of 4%; the current rate for such loans is 3.5% annually (page 26).

You may also access the value of your Policy by making a partial  withdrawal.  A
partial  withdrawal  is subject to a maximum  charge not to exceed the lesser of
$50 or 2% of the amount withdrawn  (currently,  the partial withdrawal charge is
the lesser of $25 or 2%) (page 27).                                             

ARE THERE ANY OTHER CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF A POLICY?              
Certain  states  impose  premium and other taxes in  connection  with  insurance
policies  such as the Policy.  Ameritas may deduct up to 5% of each premium as a
Percent of Premium Charge for Taxes. Currently, 3% is deducted for this purpose.

Charges  are  deducted  against  the  Accumulation  Value to  cover  the Cost of
Insurance  under the Policy and to compensate  Ameritas for  administering  each
individual Policy. These charges,  which are part of the Monthly Deduction,  are
calculated  and paid on each  Monthly  Activity  Date.  The Cost of Insurance is
calculated  based on risk  factors  relating  to the  Insureds as  reflected  in
relevant actuarial tables.  The  Administrative  Expense Charges may be based on
your Specified  Amount and the Policy duration.  However,  they may be increased
during  the life of your  Policy,  up to a maximum of $9 per month plus a charge
per month per $1000 of Specified  Amount that  depends on the younger  Insured's
Issue Age. For Issue Ages 20 - 44, the rate is $.10, for Issue Ages 45 - 54, the
rate is $.08, for Issue Ages 55 - 64, the rate is $.05 and for Issue Ages 65 and
over it is $.00.  At the current  time We  anticipate  the charge will reduce to
$.00 in year 6. The  Administrative  Expense Charge may be levied throughout the
life of the Policy and is  guaranteed  not to  increase  above $9 per month plus
$.10 per month per $1000 of  Specified  Amount  for Issue Ages  20-44,  $.08 for
Issue Ages 45-64 and $.05 for Issue Ages 65 and over.  Ameritas  does not expect
to make any profit from the Administrative Expense Charge.                      

For its services in  administering  Separate Account LLVL and Subaccounts and as
compensation for bearing certain  mortality and expense  risks,Ameritas  is also
entitled to receive fees.  These fees are  calculated  daily during the first 15
years of each Policy, at a combined annual rate of 0.60% of the value of the net
assets of Separate  Account LLVL.  After the 15th Policy  Anniversary  Date, the
combined  annual rate will  decrease to .30% of the daily net assets of Separate
Account LLVL.  The charge is  guaranteed  never to exceed .60%. No Mortality and
Expense  Risk  Charge will be  deducted  from the amounts in the Fixed  Account.
(page 34).                                                                      

Policy  Owners  who  choose  to  allocate  Net  Premiums  to one or  more of the
Subaccounts  will also bear a pro rata share of the management fees and expenses
paid by each of the  investment  portfolios  in which  the  various  Subaccounts
invest.  No such management fees are assessed against Net Premiums  allocated to
the Fixed Account (page 34).                                                    

WHEN DOES MY POLICY TERMINATE?                                                  
You may  terminate  your Policy by  Surrendering  the Policy  while at least one
Insured is alive for its Net Cash  Surrender  Value (page 22).  As noted  above,
your  Policy will  terminate  if you fail to pay  required  premiums or maintain
sufficient Net Cash Surrender Value to cover Policy charges (page 24).          

YEAR 2000 

Like  other  insurance  companies  and their  separate  accounts,  Ameritas  and
Separate  Account LLVL could be adversely  affected if the computer systems they
rely upon do not properly  process  date-related  information and data involving
the years 2000 and after.  This issue arose because both  mainframe and PC-based
computer  hardware and software have  traditionally  used two digits to identify
the year.  For example,  the year 1998 is input,  stored and calculated as "98."
Similarly,  the year 2000  would be input,  stored  and  calculated  as "00." If
computers  assume  this  means  1900,  it could  cause  errors in  calculations,
comparisons, and other computing functions.                                     

Like all insurance  companies,  Ameritas  makes  extensive use of dates and date
calculations. We began a corporate-wide Year 2000 (Y2K) project in mid-1996. Our
goal is to ensure that our computer systems continue to operate smoothly with no
service disruptions before, during or after the year 2000.

As of December 31, 1998, all of our computer  application and operating  systems
had been updated for the year 2000. Continuous testing and monitoring throughout
1999 will help Ameritas continue to meet our contractual and service obligations
to our  customers.  In addition  to our  internal  efforts,  Ameritas is working
closely  with vendors and other  business  partners to confirm that they too are
addressing Y2K issues on a timely basis. We believe that we are Y2K - compliant;
however,  in  the  event  we  or  our  service  providers,   vendors,  financial
institutions  or  others  with  which  we  conduct  business,  fail  to be Y2K -
compliant, there would be a materially adverse effect on us.

AMERITAS LIFE INSURANCE CORP. SEPARATE ACCOUNT LLVL 
Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.  Separate  Account LLVL ("Separate  Account LLVL")
was  established  under  Nebraska law on August 24, 1994. The assets of Separate
Account LLVL are held by Ameritas and are segregated from all of Ameritas' other
assets.  These assets are not  chargeable  with  liabilities  arising out of any
other  business  which  Ameritas may conduct,  including any income,  gains,  or
losses of Ameritas. Although the assets maintained in Separate Account LLVL will
not be charged with any liabilities arising out of Ameritas' other business, all
obligations  arising  under the  Policies are  liabilities  of Ameritas who will
maintain assets in Separate  Account LLVL of a total market value at least equal
to the  reserve  and  other  contract  liabilities  of  Separate  Account  LLVL.
Nevertheless,  to the extent  assets in Separate  Account LLVL exceed  Ameritas'
liabilities  in Separate  Account  LLVL,  the assets are  available to cover the
liabilities  of Ameritas'  General  Account.  Ameritas  may,  from time to time,
withdraw  assets  available to cover the General Account  obligations.  Separate
Account LLVL is registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")
under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940  ("1940  Act") as a unit  investment
trust,  which is a type of  investment  company.  This does not  involve any SEC
supervision  of the  management or investment  policies or practices of Separate
Account  LLVL.  For state law  purposes,  Separate  Account LLVL is treated as a
Division of Ameritas.                                                           

Performance Information                                                         

Performance  information  for the  Subaccounts of Separate  Account LLVL and the
Funds  available  for  investment  by  Separate   Account  LLVL  may  appear  in
advertisements,  sales  literature,  or reports to Policy Owners or  prospective
purchasers.   Ameritas  may  also  provide  a   hypothetical   illustration   of
Accumulation  Value,  Net  Cash  Surrender  Value  and  Death  Benefit  based on
historical  investment  returns  of the  Funds  for a  sample  Policy  based  on
assumptions  as to age,  sex, and risk class of each  Insured,  and other Policy
specific assumptions.                                                           

Ameritas  may  also  provide   individualized   hypothetical   illustrations  of
Accumulation  Value,  Net  Cash  Surrender  Value  and  Death  Benefit  based on
historical  investment  returns of the Funds.  These  illustrations will reflect
deductions  for Fund  expenses  and Policy and Separate  Account  LLVL  charges,
including the Monthly Deduction,  and Percent of Premium Charge for Taxes. These
hypothetical  illustrations will be based on the actual historical experience of
the Funds as if the  Subaccounts  had been in existence  and a Policy issued for
the same periods as those indicated for the Funds.

THE FUNDS 

There are currently 13  Subaccounts  within  Separate  Account LLVL available to
Policy Owners for new allocations. Each Subaccount of Separate Account LLVL will
invest only in the shares of a corresponding  portfolio of Neuberger Berman AMT,
Berger IPT or Rydex (collectively the "Funds"). Each Fund is registered with the
SEC under the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company.

The assets of each  portfolio of the Funds are held  separate from the assets of
the other  portfolios.  Thus, each portfolio  operates as a separate  investment
portfolio, and the income or losses of one portfolio generally have no effect on
the investment performance of any other portfolio.                              

Rydex  involves  strategic  or  tactical  asset  allocation,   and  may  involve
aggressive   investing   strategies.   For  that  reason,  We  have  established
administrative  rules under which We will allow  allocations,  premium  payments
and/or transfers to be made to Rydex. (See Rydex Administrative Rules, below.)  

The investment  objectives and policies of each portfolio are summarized  below.
There is no  assurance  that any of the  portfolios  will  achieve  their stated
objectives.  More detailed  information,  including a description  of investment
objectives, policies,  restrictions,  expenses and risks, is in the prospectuses
for each of the Funds,  which must accompany or precede this  Prospectus.  These
Prospectuses  should  be  read  carefully  together  with  this  Prospectus  and
retained. All underlying Fund information, including Fund prospectuses, has been
provided to Ameritas by the  underlying  Funds.  Ameritas has not  independently
verified this information.                                                      

The investments in the Funds may be managed by Fund managers which manage one or
more other mutual  funds that have similar  names,  investment  objectives,  and
investment styles as the Funds. You should be aware that the Funds are likely to
differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern,  and tax matters.
Thus,  the  holdings and  performance  of the Funds can be expected to vary from
those of the other mutual funds.                                                

Each  Policy  Owner  should  periodically  consider  the  allocation  among  the
Subaccounts  in light of current  market  conditions  and the  investment  risks
attendant to investing in the Funds' various portfolios.                        

Separate Account LLVL will purchase and redeem shares from the Portfolios at the
net asset value. Shares will be redeemed to the extent necessary for Ameritas to
collect charges, pay the surrender values, partial withdrawals,  and make Policy
loans or to transfer  assets  from one  Subaccount  to another,  or to the Fixed
Account,   as  requested  by  Policy  Owners.   Any  dividend  or  capital  gain
distribution   received  is  automatically   reinvested  in  the   corresponding
Subaccount.                                                                     

Since  Neuberger  Berman AMT,  Berger IPT and Rydex are each designed to provide
investment vehicles for variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts of
various  insurance  companies  and will be sold to  separate  accounts  of other
insurance  companies as  investment  vehicles for various types of variable life
insurance policies or variable annuity contracts,  there is a possibility that a
material  conflict may arise between the interests of Separate  Account LLVL and
one or more of the separate accounts of another participating insurance company.
In the event of a material conflict,  the affected insurance  companies agree to
take any  necessary  steps,  including  removing its separate  accounts from the
Funds,  to resolve  the matter.  The risks of such mixed and shared  funding are
described further in the prospectuses of the Funds.

directions  to Us;

or  from Rydex Subaccounts;

         but you may transfer out of a  Rydex  Subaccount  to  other  Subaccount

ADDITION, DELETION OR SUBSTITUTION OF INVESTMENTS 

Ameritas  reserves the right,  subject to  applicable  law, to add,  delete,  or
substitute  investments in Separate  Account LLVL.  Ameritas will notify the SEC
and/or state insurance  authorities and will obtain  required  approvals  before
making additions, deletions, or substitutions. Separate Account LLVL may, to the
extent permitted by law,  purchase other securities for other policies or permit
a conversion between policies upon your request.                                

Ameritas may, in its sole discretion,  also establish additional  Subaccounts of
Separate  Account LLVL, each of which would invest in shares  corresponding to a
new portfolio of the Funds or in shares of another  investment  company having a
specified investment objective. Ameritas may, in its sole discretion,  establish
new  Subaccounts or eliminate one or more  Subaccounts if marketing  needs,  tax
considerations or investment conditions warrant. Any new Subaccounts may be made
available to existing Policy Owners on a basis to be determined by Ameritas.    

If  Ameritas  considers  it to be in the best  interest  of Policy  Owners,  and
subject to any approvals that may be required  under  applicable  law,  Separate
Account LLVL may be operated as a management  company under the 1940 Act, it may
be deregistered under that Act if registration is no longer required,  or it may
be combined with other Ameritas  separate  accounts.  To the extent permitted by
applicable law,  Ameritas may also transfer the assets of Separate  Account LLVL
associated with the Policies to another separate account. In addition,  Ameritas
may,  when  permitted by law,  restrict or eliminate any voting rights of Policy
Owners or other persons who have voting rights as to Separate Account LLVL.     

If any of these  substitutions or changes are made, Ameritas may, by appropriate
endorsement,  change the Policy to reflect the substitution or change.  You will
be notified of any material change in the investment  policy of any portfolio in
which you have an interest.                                                     

FIXED ACCOUNT 

You may elect to allocate  all or a portion of your Net Premium  payments to the
Fixed Account,  and you may also transfer monies between  Separate  Account LLVL
and the Fixed Account. (See the section on Transfers.)                          

Payments  allocated to the Fixed Account and transferred  from Separate  Account
LLVL to the Fixed Account are placed in Ameritas'  General Account.  The General
Account  includes all of Ameritas'  assets,  except those assets  segregated  in
Ameritas'  separate  accounts.  Ameritas has the sole  discretion  to invest the
assets of the General  Account,  subject to applicable  law.  Ameritas  bears an
investment  risk for all amounts  allocated or transferred to the Fixed Account,
plus interest credits,  less any deduction for charges and expenses.  The Policy
Owner bears the investment risk that the declared rate,  described  below,  will
fall to a lower rate after the expiration of a declared rate period.  Because of
exemptions and  exclusionary  provisions,  interests in the General Account have
not been  registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"),  nor is
the General  Account  registered as an investment  company under the  Investment
Company Act of 1940.  Accordingly,  neither the General Account nor any interest
in it is  generally  subject  to the  provisions  of the  1933 or 1940  Act.  We
understand  that the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the  disclosures  in this
prospectus relating to the Fixed Account portion of the Policy;  however,  these
disclosures  may be subject to generally  applicable  provisions  of the Federal
Securities  Laws regarding the accuracy and  completeness  of statements made in
prospectuses.                                                                   

Ameritas  guarantees that it will credit interest at a Declared Rate of at least
3.5%. Ameritas may, at its discretion, set a higher Declared Rate(s). Each month
Ameritas will establish the Declared Rate for the Policies with a Policy Date or
Policy  Anniversary  Date in that month.  Each month is assumed to have 30 days,
and each year to have 360 days for purposes of  crediting  interest on the Fixed
Account. The Policy Owner will earn interest                                    

LLSVUL
21

P-->S-625th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
on the amounts  transferred  or allocated  to the Fixed  Account at the Declared
Rate  effective  for the month in which the  Policy  was  issued,  which rate is
guaranteed  for the  remainder  of the first  Policy  Year.  During later Policy
Years,  all amounts in the Fixed Account will earn interest at the Declared Rate
in effect in the month of the last Policy  Anniversary.  Declared interest rates
may increase or decrease  from previous  periods,  but will not fall below 3.5%.
Ameritas reserves the right to change the declaration  practice,  and the period
for which a Declared Rate will apply.                                           

POLICY BENEFITS 

The rights and  benefits  under the Policy are  summarized  in this  prospectus;
however prospectus  disclosure regarding the Policy is qualified in its entirety
by the Policy itself, a copy of which is available upon request from Ameritas . 

PURPOSES OF THE POLICY 

The Policy is designed to provide the Policy Owner with both lifetime  insurance
protection and  flexibility in the amount and frequency of premium  payments and
with the level of life insurance proceeds payable under the Policy.             

You are not required to pay scheduled  premiums to keep the Policy in force, but
you may,  subject  to  certain  limitations,  vary the  frequency  and amount of
premium payments.  You also may adjust the level of Death Benefits payable under
the Policy without having to purchase a new Policy by increasing  (with evidence
of  insurability)  or  decreasing  the  Specified  Amount.  An  increase  in the
Specified Amount will increase both the Minimum Premium and the Guaranteed Death
Benefit Premium  required.  If the Specified Amount is decreased,  however,  the
Minimum Premium and Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium will not decrease. Thus, as
insurance  needs or financial  conditions  change,  you have the  flexibility to
adjust life insurance benefits and vary premium payments.                       

The Death Benefit may, and the Accumulation Value will, vary with the investment
experience of the chosen  Subaccounts of Separate  Account LLVL. Thus the Policy
Owner  benefits from any  appreciation  in value of the underlying  assets,  but
bears the investment risk of any depreciation in value. As a result,  whether or
not a  Policy  continues  in  force  may  depend  in part  upon  the  investment
experience  of the chosen  Subaccounts.  The  failure to pay a Planned  Periodic
Premium  will not  necessarily  cause the Policy to lapse,  but the Policy could
lapse even if Planned  Periodic  Premiums  have been  paid,  depending  upon the
investment  experience  of Separate  Account  LLVL.  If the  Minimum  Premium or
Guaranteed  Death Benefit Premium is satisfied by Net Policy  Funding,  Ameritas
will keep the Policy in force during the appropriate  period and provide a Death
Benefit.  In certain  instances,  this Net Policy  Funding  will not,  after the
payment of Monthly Deductions, generate positive Net Cash Surrender Values.     

DEATH BENEFIT PROCEEDS 

As long as the Policy  remains  in force,  Ameritas  will pay the Death  Benefit
Proceeds of the Policy upon Satisfactory Proof of Death,  according to the Death
Benefit  option in effect at the time of the  Second  Death.  The  amount of the
Death  Benefits  payable will be determined  at the end of the Valuation  Period
during which the Second Death occurs.  The Death Benefit Proceeds may be paid in
a lump sum or under one or more of the payment  options set forth in the Policy.
(See the section on Payment Options.)                                           

Death  Benefit   Proceeds  will  be  paid  to  the  surviving   Beneficiary   or
Beneficiaries  you specified in the application or as subsequently  changed.  If
you do not  choose  a  Beneficiary,  the  proceeds  will be paid to you,  as the
Policyowner, or to your estate.                                                 

DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS 

The Policy provides two Death Benefit  options.  The Policyowner  selects one of
the options in the application. The Death Benefit under either option will never
be less than the  current  Specified  Amount of the Policy as long as the Policy
remains in force.  (See the  section  on Policy  Lapse and  Reinstatement.)  The
minimum initial  Specified Amount is $100,000.  The following graphs  illustrate
the differences in the two Death Benefit options.                               

[Omitted graph illustrates  payout under Death Benefit Option A, specifically by
showing  the  relationship  over  time,  between  the  specified  Amount and the
Accumulation Value.]                                                            

OPTION A.

     Death Benefit Option A.  Pays a Death Benefit equal to the Specified Amount
     or  the Accumulation Value  multiplied by  the Death Benefit percentage (as
illustrated at Point A) whichever is greater.                         

Under Option A, the Death Benefit is the current  Specified Amount of the Policy
or, if greater,  the applicable  percentage of Accumulation  Value at the Second
Death. The applicable  percentage is 250% for Attained Ages 40 or younger on the
Policy  Anniversary Date prior to the Second Death. For Attained Ages over 40 on
that  Policy  Anniversary  Date,  the  percentage  declines.  For  example,  the
percentage  at Attained Age 40 is 250%,  at Attained Age 50 is 185%, at Attained
Age 60 is 130%, at Attained Age 70 is 115%,  at Attained Age 80 is 105%,  and at
Attained Age 90 is 105%. The applicable percentage will never be less than 101%.
Accordingly, under Option A the Death Benefit will remain level at the Specified
Amount  unless the  applicable  percentage  of  Accumulation  Value  exceeds the
current  Specified  Amount,  in which case the amount of the Death  Benefit will
vary as the Accumulation Value varies. Policyowners who prefer to have favorable
investment  performance,  if any, reflected in higher Accumulation Value, rather
than increased insurance coverage, generally should select Option A.            

[Omitted graph illustrates payout under Death Benefit B, specifically by showing
the  relationship  over time,  between the specified Amount and the Accumulation
Value.]                                                                         

OPTION B.                                                                       

     Death Benefit Option B. Pays a Death Benefit equal to the Specified  Amount
     plus the Policy's  Accumulation  Value or the Accumulation Value multiplied
by the Death Benefit percentage, whichever is greater.                

Under Option B, the Death Benefit is equal to the current  Specified Amount plus
the Accumulation Value of the Policy or, if greater,  the applicable  percentage
of the Accumulation Value at the Second Death. The applicable  percentage is the
same as under  Option A: 250% for  Attained  Ages 40 or  younger  on the  Policy
Anniversary  Date prior to the Second  Death.  For Attained Ages over 40 on that
Policy Anniversary Date the percentage declines. Accordingly, under Option B the
amount of the Death  Benefit will always vary as the  Accumulation  Value varies
(but will never be less than the Specified Amount).  Policy Owners who prefer to
have favorable investment performance,  if any, reflected in increased insurance
coverage, rather than higher Accumulation Values, generally should select Option
B.                                                                              

CHANGE IN DEATH BENEFIT OPTION. The Death Benefit option may be changed once per
year after the first  Policy  Year by sending  Ameritas a written  request.  The
effective  date  of  such a  change  will  be the  Monthly  Activity  Date on or
following the date the change is approved by Ameritas. A change may have federal
tax consequences.                                                               

If the Death Benefit  option is changed from Option A to Option B, the Specified
Amount after the change will equal the  Specified  Amount before the change less
the Accumulation Value as of the date of the change. If the Death Benefit option
is changed from Option B to Option A, the Specified  Amount under Option A after
the change will equal the Death Benefit under Option B on the effective  date of
change.                                                                         

No charges will be imposed upon a change in Death Benefit option,  nor will such
a change  in and of  itself  result in an  immediate  change in the  amount of a
Policy's  Accumulation Value.  However, a change in the Death Benefit option may
affect the Cost of  Insurance  because this charge  varies  depending on the Net
Amount at Risk.  Changing from Option B to Option A generally  will decrease the
Net  Amount  at Risk in the  future,  and will  therefore  decrease  the Cost of
Insurance.  Changing  from  Option A to  Option B  generally  will  result in an
increase in the Cost of Insurance  over time because the Cost of Insurance  rate
will increase with the ages of the Insureds,  even though the Net Amount at Risk
will  generally  remain level.  (See the sections on Charges and  Deductions and
Federal Tax Matters.)                                                           

CHANGE IN  SPECIFIED  AMOUNT.  Subject to certain  limitations,  after the first
Policy Year, a Policy Owner may increase or decrease the  Specified  Amount of a
Policy.  A change in  Specified  Amount  affects  the Net Amount at Risk,  which
affects the Cost of Insurance  and may have federal tax  consequences.  (See the
sections on Charges and Deductions

and Federal Tax Matters.)                                                       

Any increase or decrease in the  Specified  Amount will become  effective on the
Monthly  Activity Date on or following the date a written request is approved by
Ameritas. The Specified Amount of a Policy may be changed only once per year and
Ameritas may limit the size of a change in a Policy Year.  The Specified  Amount
remaining in force after any requested  decrease may not be less than  $100,000.
In addition,  if a decrease in the Specified  Amount makes the Policy not comply
with the maximum premium limits required by federal tax law, the decrease may be
limited or the Accumulation  Value may be returned to you, at your election,  to
the extent necessary to meet the requirements. (See the section on Premiums.)   

Increases in the  Specified  Amount will be allowed after the first Policy Year.
For an increase in the Specified Amount, you must submit a written  supplemental
application.  Ameritas may also  require  additional  evidence of  insurability.
Although  an increase  need not  necessarily  be  accompanied  by an  additional
premium,  in certain  cases an  additional  premium  will be required to put the
requested  increase in effect.  (See the section on Premiums  upon  Increases in
Specified  Amount.)  The  minimum  amount of any  increase  is  $50,000,  and an
increase cannot be made if either Insured was over age 85 on the previous Policy
Anniversary Date. An increase in the Specified Amount during the time either the
Minimum  Benefit or the  Guaranteed  Death  Benefit  provision is in effect will
increase the respective  premium  requirements.  (See the section on Charges and
Deductions.)                                                                    

METHODS OF AFFECTING INSURANCE PROTECTION 

You may increase or decrease the pure insurance  protection provided by a Policy
- the  difference  between  the Death  Benefit and the  Accumulation  Value - in
several ways as your insurance  needs change.  These ways include  increasing or
decreasing  the  Specified  Amount of  insurance,  changing the level of premium
payments,  and making a partial withdrawal of the Policy's  Accumulation  Value.
Certain of these changes may have federal tax consequences.  The consequences of
each of these methods will depend upon the individual circumstances.            

DURATION OF THE POLICY 

The duration of the Policy generally  depends upon the  Accumulation  Value. The
Policy  will  remain  in  force  so long  as the Net  Cash  Surrender  Value  is
sufficient to pay the Monthly  Deduction or if the Minimum Benefit or Guaranteed
Death  Benefit  provision  is in  effect.  (See  the  section  on  Charges  from
Accumulation Value.) However,  when the Net Cash Surrender Value is insufficient
to pay the Monthly  Deduction and the Grace Period  expires  without an adequate
payment by the Policy Owner, the Policy will lapse and terminate  without value.
(See the section on Policy Lapse and Reinstatement.)                            

ACCUMULATION VALUE 

The  Accumulation  Value will reflect the  investment  performance of the chosen
Investment  Options,  the Net Premiums  paid, any partial  withdrawals,  and the
charges assessed in connection with the Policy. A Policy Owner may Surrender the
Policy at any time and receive the Policy's Net Cash Surrender  Value.  (See the
section on Surrenders.) There is no guaranteed minimum Accumulation Value.      

Accumulation  Value is determined on each Valuation Date. On the Issue Date, the
Accumulation  Value will equal the portion of any Net Premium  allocated  to the
Investment  Options,  reduced  by the  portion  of the first  Monthly  Deduction
allocated to the Investment Options.  (See the section on Allocation of Premiums
and Accumulation  Value.)  Thereafter,  on each Valuation Date, the Accumulation
Value of the Policy will equal:                                                 
     (1) The aggregate values belonging to the Policy in each of the Subaccounts
         on the Valuation Date, determined by multiplying each Subaccount's unit
       value by the number of Subaccount units allocated to the Policy; plus
(2) The value of allocations to the Fixed Account; plus               
     (3) Any Accumulation  Value impaired by Outstanding Policy Debt held in the
General Account; plus                                         
(4) Any Net Premiums received on that Valuation Date; less            
     (5) Any  partial  withdrawal, and its charge, made on  that Valuation Date;
less                                                          
(6) Any Monthly  Deduction to be made on that Valuation Date; less    

LLSVUL
24

P-->S-628th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
     (7) Any  federal or  state income  taxes charged  against the  Accumulation
Value.                                                        

In computing the Policy's  Accumulation  Value on the Valuation Date, the number
of Subaccount  units  allocated to the Policy is determined  after any transfers
among  Investment  Options (and deduction of transfer  charges),  but before any
other  Policy  transactions,  such  as  receipt  of  Net  Premiums  and  partial
withdrawals.  Because the Accumulation Value depends on a number of variables, a
Policy's Accumulation Value cannot be predetermined.                            

THE UNIT  VALUE.  The unit  value of each  Subaccount  reflects  the  investment
performance of that Subaccount.  The unit value of each Subaccount is calculated
by:                                                                             
     (1) Multiplying he net asset value per share of each Fund portfolio  on the
         Valuation  Date times  the  number of  shares  held by that Subaccount,
         before the purchase or redemption of any shares on that Valuation Date;
minus                                                         
     (2) A charge for  mortality and expense risk at an annual rate  of .40%  in
Policy Years 1-15, decreasing to .10% thereafter; minus       
     (3) A charge for administrative service expenses at an annual rate of .20%;
and                                                           
     (4) Dividing the result by the total number of units held in the Subaccount
         on  the  Valuation  Date,  before  the  purchase  or redemption of  any
         units on that Valuation Date. (See the section on Daily Charges Against
the Separate Account.)                                        

VALUATION DATE AND VALUATION  PERIOD.  A Valuation Date is each day on which the
New York Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE") is open for trading.  The net asset value for
each Fund  portfolio  is  determined  as of the close of regular  trading on the
NYSE. The net investment  return for each  Subaccount and all  transactions  and
calculations  with  respect  to  the  Policies  as of  any  Valuation  Date  are
determined as of that time.  The  transaction  cut-off time for receipt by Us of
Premium Payments and all transactions with respect to Rydex is 1:30 p.m. Central
time,  or one hour  before  market  close,  for days on which the market  closes
early. A Valuation Period is the period between two successive  Valuation Dates,
commencing  at the close of the NYSE on each  Valuation  Date and  ending at the
close of the NYSE on the next succeeding Valuation Date.                        

PAYMENT OF POLICY BENEFITS 

Death Benefit  Proceeds  under the Policy will usually be paid within seven days
after Ameritas receives  Satisfactory Proof of Death.  Payments may be postponed
in certain  circumstances.  (See the section on  Postponement  of Payments.) The
Policy Owner may decide the form in which Death  Benefit  Proceeds will be paid.
While at least one Insured is alive,  the Policy Owner may arrange for the Death
Benefit  Proceeds to be paid in a lump sum or under one or more of the  optional
methods of payment  described below.  Changes must be in writing and will revoke
all prior  elections.  If no election is made,  Ameritas  will pay Death Benefit
Proceeds  or  Accumulation  Value  Benefits  in a lump sum.  When Death  Benefit
Proceeds  are  payable in a lump sum and no election  for an optional  method of
payment is in force at the Second Death the  Beneficiary  may select one or more
of the optional  methods of payment.  Further,  if the Policy is  assigned,  any
amounts due to the assignee will first be paid in one sum. The balance,  if any,
may be applied under any payment option.  Once payments have begun,  the payment
option may not be changed.                                                      

PAYMENT OPTIONS FOR DEATH BENEFIT  PROCEEDS.  The minimum amount of each payment
is $100.  If a payment  would be less than $100,  Ameritas has the right to make
payments less often so that the amount of each payment is at least $100.  Once a
payment  option is in effect,  Death  Benefit  Proceeds will be  transferred  to
Ameritas' General Account.  Ameritas may make other payment options available in
the future. For additional  information concerning these options, see the Policy
itself. The following payment options are currently available:                  

OPTION AI--INTEREST PAYMENT OPTION.  Ameritas will hold any amount applied under
this option.  Interest on the unpaid balance will be paid or credited each month
at a rate determined by Ameritas.                                               

OPTION  AII--FIXED  AMOUNT  PAYABLE  OPTION.  Each payment will be for an agreed
fixed amount. Payments continue until the amount Ameritas holds runs out.       

OPTION  B--FIXED  PERIOD  PAYMENT  OPTION.  Equal  payments will be made for any
period selected up to 20 years.                                                 

OPTION C--LIFETIME PAYMENT OPTION.  Equal monthly payments are based on the life
of a named  person.  Payments  will  continue  for the  lifetime of that person.
Variations provide for guaranteed payments for a period of time.                

LLSVUL
25

P-->S-629th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
OPTION D--JOINT LIFETIME PAYMENT OPTION. Equal monthly payments are based on the
lives of two named persons. While both are living, one payment will be made each
month.  When one dies,  the same payment  will  continue for the lifetime of the
other.                                                                          

As an alternative to the above payment options,  Death Benefits  Proceeds may be
paid in any  other  manner  approved  by  Ameritas.  Further,  one of  Ameritas'
affiliates  may make payments under the above payment  options.  If an affiliate
makes the payment,  it will do so according to the request of the Policy  Owner,
using the rules set out above.                                                  

POLICY RIGHTS 

LOAN BENEFITS 

LOAN  PRIVILEGES.  The Policy  Owner may borrow an amount up to the  current Net
Cash  Surrender  Value less twelve times the most recent Monthly  Deduction,  at
regular or reduced loan rates (described below). Loans usually are funded within
seven days after  receipt  of a written  request.  The loan may be repaid at any
time while at least one Insured is living.  Policy Owners in certain  states may
borrow 100% of the Net Cash Surrender Value after deducting  Monthly  Deductions
and any  interest  on policy  loans  that will be due for the  remainder  of the
Policy Year.  Loans may have tax  consequences.  (See the section on Federal Tax
Matters.)                                                                       

LOAN INTEREST. Ameritas charges interest to Policy Owners at regular and reduced
rates. Regular loans will accrue interest on a daily basis at a rate of up to 6%
per year; currently the interest rate on regular Policy loans is 5.5%. Each year
after the tenth Policy  Anniversary  Date, the Policy Owner may borrow a limited
amount of the Net Cash  Surrender  Value at a reduced  interest  rate. For those
loans, interest will accrue on a daily basis at a rate of up to 4% per year; the
current reduced loan rate is 3.5%. The amount available at the reduced loan rate
is (1) the Accumulation  Value,  minus (2) total premiums paid minus any partial
withdrawals  previously taken, and minus (3) any Outstanding Policy Debt held at
a reduced loan rate. However, this amount may not exceed the maximum loan amount
described  above.  (See the  section on Loan  Privileges.)  If unpaid  when due,
interest  will be added to the amount of the loan and bear  interest at the same
rate.  The Policy Owner earns 3.5% interest on the  Accumulation  Values held in
the General Account securing the loans.                                         

EFFECT OF POLICY  LOANS.  When a loan is made,  Accumulation  Value equal to the
amount  of the loan  will be  transferred  from the  Investment  Options  to the
General  Account as security for the loan. The  Accumulation  Value  transferred
will be allocated from the Investment  Options according to the instructions you
give when you  request  the  loan.  The  minimum  amount  which can  remain in a
Subaccount  or  the  Fixed  Account  as a  result  of a  loan  is  $100.  If  no
instructions  are given,  the amounts  will be withdrawn  in  proportion  to the
various  Accumulation  Values in the Investment Options. In any Policy Year that
loan  interest is not paid when due,  Ameritas  will add the interest due to the
principal  amount of the Policy loan on the next Policy  Anniversary.  This loan
interest due will be transferred  from the Investment  Options as set out above.
No  charge  will be made for these  transfers.  A Policy  loan will  permanently
affect the Accumulation Value and may permanently affect the amount of the Death
Benefits,  even if the loan is repaid.  Policy loans will also affect Net Policy
Funding for determining whether the Minimum Benefit and Guaranteed Death Benefit
provisions are met.                                                             

Interest  earned on amounts held in the General Account will be allocated to the
Investment  Options on each Policy  Anniversary in the same  proportion that Net
Premiums  are being  allocated  to those  Investment  Options at the time.  Upon
repayment of loan amounts,  the portion of the repayment allocated in accordance
with the repayment of loan provision (see below) will be transferred to increase
the Accumulation Value in that Investment Option.                               

OUTSTANDING  POLICY DEBT.  The  Outstanding  Policy Debt equals the total of all
Policy loans and accrued  interest on Policy loans.  If the  Outstanding  Policy
Debt exceeds the Accumulation Value less any Accrued Expense Charges, the Policy
Owner must pay the excess.  Ameritas will send a notice of the amount which must
be paid.  If you do not make  the  required  payment  within  the 61 days  after
Ameritas sends the notice,  the Policy will terminate  without value  ("lapse").
Should the Policy lapse while Policy loans are  outstanding,  the portion of the
loans attributable to earnings will become taxable.  You may lower the risk of a
Policy  lapsing  while loans are  outstanding  as a result of a reduction in the
market value of  investments  in the  Subaccounts  by investing in a diversified
group of lower risk investment  portfolios and/or  transferring the funds to the
Fixed Account and receiving a guaranteed rate of return. Should you experience a
substantial reduction,  you may need to lower anticipated withdrawals and loans,
repay loans,  make additional  premium  payments,  or take other action to avoid
Policy  lapse.  A lapsed  Policy may later be  reinstated.  (See the  section on
Policy Lapse and Reinstatement.)                                                

LLSVUL
26

P-->S-630th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
REPAYMENT OF LOAN.  Unscheduled premiums paid while a Policy loan is outstanding
are treated as repayment of the debt only if the Policy Owner so requests.  As a
loan is repaid,  the  Accumulation  Value in the General  Account  securing  the
repaid loan will be allocated among the Subaccounts and the Fixed Account in the
same proportion that Net Premiums are being allocated at the time of repayment. 

SURRENDERS 

At any time while at least one Insured is alive, the Policy Owner may withdraw a
portion of the  Accumulation  Value or Surrender the Policy by sending a written
request  to  Ameritas.  The  amount  available  for  Surrender  is the Net  Cash
Surrender Value at the end of the Valuation Period when the Surrender request is
received at Ameritas' Home Office.  There are no surrender  charges.  Surrenders
will generally be paid within seven days of receipt of the written request. (See
the section on Postponement of Payments.)  Surrenders may have tax consequences.
Once a Policy is Surrendered,  it may not be reinstated. (See the section on Tax
Treatment of Policy Proceeds.)                                                  

If the Policy is being  Surrendered  in its entirety,  the Policy itself must be
returned  to Ameritas  along with the  request.  Ameritas  will pay the Net Cash
Surrender  Value.  Coverage  under the Policy will terminate as of the date of a
total Surrender.  A Policy Owner may elect to have the amount paid in a lump sum
or under a payment option.  (See the section on Payment Options.)               

PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS 

Partial withdrawals are irrevocable.  The amount of a partial withdrawal may not
be less than $500. The Net Cash Surrender Value after a partial  withdrawal must
be at least $1,000 or an amount  sufficient  to maintain the Policy in force for
the remainder of the Policy Year.                                               

The amount paid will be deducted from the Investment  Options  according to your
instructions  when you  request the  withdrawal.  However,  the  minimum  amount
remaining  in a  Subaccount  as a  result  of  the  allocation  is  $100.  If no
instructions  are given,  the amounts  will be withdrawn  in  proportion  to the
various Accumulation Values in the Investment Options.                          

The Death  Benefit will be reduced by the amount of any partial  withdrawal  and
may affect the way the Cost of  Insurance is  calculated  and the amount of pure
insurance  protection under the Policy. (See the sections on Monthly Deduction -
Cost of Insurance  and Death  Benefit  Options - Methods of Affecting  Insurance
Protection.) If Death Benefit option B is in effect,  the Specified  Amount will
not change, but the Accumulation Value will be reduced.                         

A fee which does not exceed the lesser of $50 or 2% of the amount  withdrawn  is
deducted from the Accumulation Value. Currently, the charge is the lesser of $25
or 2% of the amount withdrawn.  (See the section on Partial Withdrawal  Charge.)
Partial  withdrawals will also affect Net Policy Funding for determining whether
the Minimum Benefit and Guaranteed Death Benefit provisions are met.            

TRANSFERS 

Accumulation  Value may be transferred among the Subaccounts of Separate Account
LLVL and to the Fixed  Account as often as desired.  However,  you may make only
one transfer out of the Fixed Account per Policy Year. We may limit the transfer
period to the 30 days following the Policy  Anniversary  Date. The transfers may
be ordered in person, by mail or by telephone. The total amount transferred each
time must be at least  $250,  or the  balance of the  Subaccount,  if less.  The
minimum  amount that may remain in a  Subaccount  or the Fixed  Account  after a
transfer is $100.  The first 15 transfers per Policy Year will be permitted free
of charge.  After that, a transfer  charge of $10 may be imposed each additional
time  amounts are  transferred.  Currently  no charge is imposed for  additional
transfers.  This charge will be deducted pro rata from each Subaccount  (and, if
applicable,  the Fixed Account) in which the Policy Owner is invested.  (See the
section on Transfer Charge.) Additional restrictions on transfers may be imposed
at the fund level.  Transfers  resulting  from  Policy  loans or exercise of the
exchange  privilege  will not be subject  to a  transfer  charge and will not be
counted  towards the guaranteed 15 free transfers per Policy Year.  Ameritas may
at any time  revoke or modify the  transfer  privilege,  including  the  minimum
amount transferable.

We will only allow  transfers with regard to Rydex  according to  administrative
rules We have set.                                                              

Transfers  out of the Fixed  Account,  unless part of the dollar cost  averaging
systematic  program  described  below,  are  limited  to one  per  Policy  Year.
Transfers  out of the Fixed Account are limited to the greater of (1) 25% of the
Fixed Account  attributable to the Policy;  (2) the largest transfer made by the
Policy Owner out of the Fixed Account during the last 13 months;  or (3) $1,000.
This  provision  is not  available  while dollar cost  averaging  from the Fixed
Account.                                                                        

The privilege to initiate  transactions  by telephone  will be made available to
Policy  Owners  automatically.  Ameritas  will employ  reasonable  procedures to
confirm that instructions  communicated by telephone are genuine, and if it does
not,  Ameritas may be liable for any losses due to  unauthorized  or  fraudulent
instructions.  The procedures  Ameritas  follows for  transactions  initiated by
telephone include, but are not limited to, requiring the Policy Owner to provide
the Policy number at the time of giving  transfer  instructions;  Ameritas' tape
recording of all telephone transfer instructions; and Ameritas providing written
confirmation of telephone transactions.                                         

SYSTEMATIC PROGRAMS 

Ameritas may offer systematic  programs as discussed below.  These programs will
be subject to  administrative  guidelines  Ameritas may  establish  from time to
time.  Transfers of  Accumulation  Value made pursuant to these programs will be
counted in determining whether any transfer fee may apply. Lower minimum amounts
may be allowed to transfer as part of a systematic  program.  No other  separate
fee is assessed when one of these options is chosen.  All other normal  transfer
restrictions, as described above, also apply.                                   

You can request  participation  in the available  programs when  purchasing  the
Policy  or at a  later  date.  You  can  change  the  allocation  percentage  or
discontinue  any program by sending  written  notice or calling the Home Office.
Other scheduled  programs may be made available.  Ameritas reserves the right to
modify,  suspend or  terminate  such  programs  at any time.  Use of  systematic
programs may not be advantageous, and does not guarantee success.               

PORTFOLIO REBALANCING. Under the Portfolio Rebalancing program, you can instruct
Ameritas to reallocate the Accumulation Value among the Subaccounts (but not the
Fixed  Account) on a systematic  basis  according to your  specified  allocation
instructions.                                                                   

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING. Under the Dollar Cost Averaging program, you can instruct
Ameritas to  automatically  transfer,  on a systematic  basis,  a  predetermined
amount or  specified  percentage  from the Fixed  Account  or the  Liquid  Asset
Subaccount to any other  Subaccount(s).  Dollar cost averaging is permitted from
the Fixed  Account if each monthly  transfer is no more than 1/36th of the value
of the Fixed Account at the time dollar cost averaging is established.          

EARNINGS SWEEP. This program permits systematic redistribution of earnings among
Investment Options.                                                             

FREE-LOOK PRIVILEGE 

You may cancel the Policy  within 10 days after you receive  it,  within 10 days
after  Ameritas  delivers a notice of your right of  cancellation,  or within 45
days of completing Part I of the application,  whichever is later.  When allowed
by state  law,  the amount of the refund is the net  premiums  allocated  to the
Investment Options, adjusted by investment gains and losses, plus the sum of all
charges  deducted from premiums paid.  Otherwise,  the amount of the refund will
equal the gross premiums paid. To cancel the Policy,  you should mail or deliver
it to the selling agent, or to Ameritas at the Home Office. A refund of premiums
paid by check may be delayed  until the check has  cleared  your bank.  (See the
section on Postponement of Payments.)                                           

PAYMENT AND ALLOCATION OF PREMIUMS 

ISSUANCE OF A POLICY 

Individuals wishing to purchase a Policy must complete an application and submit
it to Ameritas' Home Office (5900 "O" Street, P.O. Box 81889, Lincoln,  Nebraska
68501).  A Policy will generally be issued only to individuals  between the ages
of 20 and 90 at the time of purchase,  although at least one of the  individuals
must be no older  than 85,  and both of whom  supply  satisfactory  evidence  of
insurability to Ameritas AVLIC.  Acceptance is subject to Ameritas' underwriting
rules,  and Ameritas AVLIC  reserves the right to reject an application  for any
reason.

P-->S-632nd�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
The  Policy  Date  is the  effective  date  for  all  coverage  in the  original
application.  The Policy Date is used to  determine  Policy  Anniversary  Dates,
Policy Years and Policy  Months.  The Issue Date is the date that all financial,
contractual and administrative  requirements have been met and processed for the
Policy.  The  Policy  Date and the Issue  Date will be the same  unless:  (1) an
earlier Policy Date is  specifically  requested,  or (2) additional  premiums or
application amendments are needed. When there are additional requirements before
issue  (see  below)  the  Policy  Date  will be the date the  Policy is sent for
delivery and the Issue Date will be the date the requirements are met.          

When all required  premiums and  application  amendments  have been  received by
Ameritas  in its Home  Office,  the Issue  Date  will be the date the  Policy is
mailed  to you or sent to the  agent  for  delivery  to  you.  When  application
amendments  or  additional  premiums  need to be obtained  upon  delivery of the
Policy, the Issue Date will be when the Policy receipt and Federal Funds (monies
of member banks within the Federal Reserve System which are held on deposit at a
Federal  Reserve  Bank)  are  received  and  available  to  Ameritas,   and  the
application  amendments are received and reviewed in Ameritas' Home Office. Your
initial Net Premium will be allocated to the Liquid Asset Portfolio for thirteen
days after the Issue Date, unless,  where available,  you have allocated 100% to
the Fixed Account.  Then,  thirteen days after the Issue Date, the  Accumulation
Value of the Policy will be allocated among the Subaccounts and/or Fixed Account
according to the instructions in your application.                              

Where allowed, if you have allocated 100% to the Fixed Account,  the Net Premium
of the  Policy is  allocated  to the Fixed  Account on the Issue  Date.  In this
instance, no further allocation will occur.                                     

Subject to approval,  a Policy may be backdated,  but the Policy Date may not be
more than six months  prior to the date of the  application.  Backdating  can be
advantageous  if a lower Issue Age for either  Insured  results in lower Cost of
Insurance Rates. If a Policy is backdated,  the minimum initial premium required
will  include  sufficient  premium  to  cover  the  backdating  period.  Monthly
deductions will be made for the period the Policy Date is backdated.            

Interim  conditional  insurance coverage may be issued prior to the Policy Date,
provided that certain  conditions are met, upon the completion of an application
and the  payment of the  required  premium at the time of the  application.  The
amount of the  interim  coverage  is limited to  $100,000.  Premium  will not be
accepted with applications for coverage in amounts of $1,000,000 or more.       

PREMIUMS 

No insurance will take effect before the initial  premium payment is received by
Ameritas in Federal Funds. The initial premium payment must be at least equal to
the monthly Minimum Premium times one more than the number of months between the
Policy Date and the Issue Date.  Subsequent  premiums  are payable at  Ameritas'
Home Office.  A Policy Owner has  flexibility in  determining  the frequency and
amount of premiums. However, unless you have paid sufficient premiums to pay the
Monthly  Deduction and Percent of Premium Charge for Taxes the Policy may have a
zero Net Cash Surrender Value and lapse.  Net Policy Funding,  if adequate,  may
satisfy Minimum Premium and/or  Guaranteed  Death Benefit Premium  requirements.
(See the section on Policy Benefits, Purposes of the Policy.)                   

PLANNED PERIODIC PREMIUMS.  At the time the Policy is issued you may determine a
Planned  Periodic  Premium  schedule  that  provides  for the  payment  of level
premiums at  selected  intervals.  You may want to consider  setting the Planned
Periodic  Premium no lower than the Guaranteed  Death Benefit  Premium to assure
proper  funding of the  Guaranteed  Death  Benefit.  You are not required to pay
premiums in accordance with this schedule. You have considerable  flexibility to
alter the amount and frequency of premiums paid.  Ameritas reserves the right to
limit the number and amount of additional or unscheduled premium payments.      

You may also change the  frequency  and amount of Planned  Periodic  Premiums by
sending a written  request to the Home Office,  although  Ameritas  reserves the
right to limit any  increase.  Premium  payment  notices will be sent  annually,
semi-annually or quarterly, depending upon the frequency of the Planned Periodic
Premiums.  Payment of the Planned Periodic  Premiums does not guarantee that the
Policy remains in force unless the Minimum  Benefit or Guaranteed  Death Benefit
provision is in effect.  Instead,  the  duration of the Policy  depends upon the
Policy's Net Cash

Surrender Value. (See the section on Duration of the  Policy.)Unless the Minimum
Benefit or  Guaranteed  Death  Benefit  provision is in effect,  even if Planned
Periodic  Premiums  are  paid,  the  Policy  will  lapse  any  time the Net Cash
Surrender  Value is  insufficient  to pay the Monthly  Deduction,  and the Grace
Period expires  without a sufficient  payment.  (See the section on Policy Lapse
and Reinstatement.)                                                             

PREMIUM  LIMITS.  Ameritas'current  minimum premium limit is $45, $15 if paid by
automatic bank draft.  Ameritas  currently has no maximum  premium limit,  other
than the  current  maximum  premium  limits  established  by  federal  tax laws.
Ameritas  reserves  the right to change any premium  limit.  In no event may the
total of all premiums  paid,  both planned and  unscheduled,  exceed the current
maximum premium limits  established by federal tax laws. (See the section on Tax
Status of the Policy.)                                                          

If at any time a premium is paid which would result in total premiums  exceeding
the current maximum  premium  limits,  Ameritas will only accept that portion of
the premium which will make total  premiums  equal the maximum.  Any part of the
premium in excess of that amount will be returned or applied as otherwise agreed
and no further  premiums will be accepted  until allowed by the current  maximum
premium  limits  allowed by law.  Ameritas  may require  additional  evidence of
insurability  if any premium payment would result in an increase in the Policy's
Net Amount at Risk on the date the premium is received.                         

PREMIUMS UPON INCREASES IN SPECIFIED  AMOUNT.  Depending  upon the  Accumulation
Value of the Policy at the time of an  increase in the  Specified  Amount of the
Policy  and the  amount  of the  increase  requested  by the  Policy  Owner,  an
additional  premium  payment may be  required.  Ameritas  will notify you of any
premium  required to fund the  increase,  which premium must be made in a single
payment.  The Accumulation Value of the Policy will be immediately  increased by
the amount of the payment,  less the  applicable  Percent of Premium  Charge for
Taxes.                                                                          

ALLOCATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCUMULATION VALUE 

ALLOCATION OF NET PREMIUMS.  In the application  for a Policy,  the Policy Owner
allocates Net Premiums to one or more  Subaccounts  and/or to the Fixed Account.
Allocations must be whole number percentages and must total 100%. The allocation
of future  Net  Premiums  may be  changed  without  charge by  providing  proper
notification to the Home Office. If there is any Outstanding  Policy Debt at the
time of a payment,  Ameritas will treat the payment as a premium  payment unless
you instruct otherwise by proper written notice.                                

On the Issue Date,  the initial Net Premium will be allocated to the  Investment
Options you selected.  When state or other applicable law or regulation requires
return of at least your  premium  payments  if you  return the Policy  under the
free-look  privilege,  the initial Net Premium  will be  allocated to the Liquid
Asset  Subaccount  for 13  days.  Thereafter,  the  Accumulation  Value  will be
reallocated to the Investment Options you selected. Premium payments received by
Ameritas prior to the Issue Date are held in the General Account until the Issue
Date and are credited  with  interest at a rate  determined  by Ameritas for the
period from the date the payment has been  converted  into Federal  Funds and is
available to Ameritas. In no event will interest be credited prior to the Policy
Date.                                                                           

The  Accumulation  Value  of the  Subaccounts  will  vary  with  the  investment
performance  of these  Subaccounts  and you, as the Policy Owner,  will bear the
entire  investment risk. This will affect the Policy's  Accumulation  Value, and
may  affect the Death  Benefit as well.  You  should  periodically  review  your
allocations  of premiums  and values in light of market  conditions  and overall
financial planning requirements.                                                

POLICY LAPSE AND REINSTATEMENT 

LAPSE.  Unlike  conventional  life  insurance  policies,  the  failure to make a
Planned  Periodic  Premium  payment  will not itself  cause the Policy to lapse.
Lapse will occur when the Net Cash Surrender  Value is insufficient to cover the
Monthly  Deduction  and a Grace Period  expires  without a  sufficient  payment,
unless the Minimum Benefit or Guaranteed  Death Benefit  provision is in effect.
The Grace Period is 61 days from the date Ameritas mails a notice that the Grace
Period has  begun.Ameritas  will notify you at the beginning of the Grace Period
by mail addressed to your last known address on file with  Ameritas.  The notice
will  specify the premium  required  to keep the Policy in force.  The  required
premium will equal the lesser of (1) Monthly  Deductions plus Percent of Premium
charges for the three Policy Months after commencement of the Grace Period, plus
projected  loan interest that would accrue over that period,  or (2) the premium
required under the Minimum Benefit or Guaranteed  Death Benefit  provisions,  if
applicable,  to keep

the Policy in effect for three months from the commencement of the Grace Period.
Failure to pay the required premium within the Grace Period will result in lapse
of the Policy.  If the Second Death occurs during the Grace Period,  any overdue
Monthly  Deductions and Outstanding  Policy Debt will be deducted from the Death
Benefit Proceeds. (See the section on Charges and Deductions.)                  

REINSTATEMENT.  A lapsed  Policy may be  reinstated  any time within three years
(five years in Missouri)  after the beginning of the Grace Period  provided both
Insureds are living.  Reinstatement  will be based on the rating  classes of the
Insureds at the time of the reinstatement.                                      

Reinstatement is subject to the following:                                      
   (1) Evidence of  insurability  of  both  Insureds  satisfactory  to  Ameritas
       (including evidence of insurability of any person covered  by  a rider to
reinstate the rider);                                             
   (2) Any Outstanding  Policy Debt on the date of lapse will be reinstated with
interest due and accrued;                                         
   (3) The Policy cannot be reinstated if  it has  been Surrendered for its full
Net Cash Surrender  Value;                                        
(4) The minimum premium required at reinstatement is the greater of:      
         (a) the amount  necessary  to raise the Net Cash Surrender Value as  of
        the date of reinstatement to equal to or greater than zero; or
(b) three times the current Monthly Deduction.                

The amount of Accumulation  Value on the date of  reinstatement  will equal:    
   (1) The  amount of  the  Net  Cash  Surrender Value on  the  date  of  lapse,
increased by                                                      
(2) The premium paid at reinstatement, less                               
(3) The Percent of Premium Charge                                         

If any  Outstanding  Policy  Debt  is  reinstated,  that  debt  will  be held in
Ameritas' General Account.  Accumulation Value calculations will then proceed as
described under the section on Accumulation Value.                              

The effective date of  reinstatement  will be the first Monthly Activity Date on
or next  following  the date of  approval by  Ameritas  of the  application  for
reinstatement.                                                                  

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS 

Charges will be deducted in connection  with the Policy to  compensate  Ameritas
for:  (1)  providing  the  insurance  benefits  set forth in the  Policy and any
optional  insurance  benefits added by rider; (2)  administering  the Policy and
payment of applicable  taxes;  (3) assuming certain risks in connection with the
Policy;  and (4) incurring  expenses in distributing the Policy.  The nature and
amount of these charges are described more fully below.                         

DEDUCTIONS FROM PREMIUM PAYMENTS 

PERCENT OF PREMIUM  CHARGE FOR TAXES.  A deduction of up to 3% of the premium is
made from each premium  payment;  currently  the charge is 3%. The  deduction is
intended to partially  offset the premium  taxes imposed by the states and their
subdivisions, and to help defray the tax cost due to capitalizing certain policy
acquisition  expenses as required under  applicable  federal tax laws.  (See the
section on Federal Tax  Matters .)  Ameritas  does not expect to derive a profit
from the Percent of Premium Charge for Taxes.                                   

CHARGES FROM ACCUMULATION VALUE 

MONTHLY  DEDUCTIONS.  Charges will be deducted as of the Policy Date and on each
Monthly  Activity Date thereafter from the  Accumulation  Value of the Policy to
compensate Ameritas for administrative  expenses and insurance  provided.  These
charges will be allocated  from the Investment  Options in accordance  with your
instructions.  If no  instructions  are given the charges will be allocated  pro
rata among the  Investment  Options.  Each of these charges is described in more
detail below.                                                                   

ADMINISTRATIVE   EXPENSE  CHARGE.  To  compensate   Ameritas  for  the  ordinary
administrative expenses expected to be incurred in connection with a Policy, the
Monthly  Deduction may include a level per policy charge.

P-->S-635th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
In addition,  for all Specified  Amounts there may be a charge of up to $.10 per
month per $1000 of Specified  amount,  depending on the younger  Insured's Issue
Age. For Issue Ages 20 - 44, the rate is $.10,  for Issue Ages 45 - 54, the rate
is $.08,  for Issue  Ages 55 - 64,  the rate is $.05,  and for Issue Ages 65 and
over it is $.00. At the current time we  anticipate  that the charge will reduce
to $.00 in year 6. In addition,  for all Specified  Amounts there currently is a
charge  of $.05 per  month per $1000 of  Specified  Amount in years  1-5.  It is
anticipated  that that charge  will  reduce to $0 in year 6. The  Administrative
Expense Charge may be levied throughout the life of the Policy and is guaranteed
not to  increase  above  $9 per  month  plus a charge  per  month  per  $1000 of
Specified  Amount of $.10 for Issue  Ages  20-44,  $.08 for Issue Ages 45-64 and
$.05 for Issue  Ages 65 and  over.05  per month per $1000 of  Specified  Amount.
Ameritas  does not expect to make any  profit  from the  Administrative  Expense
Charge.                                                                         

COST OF INSURANCE. Because the Cost of Insurance depends upon several variables,
the cost for each  Policy  Month can vary from  month to  month.  Ameritas  will
determine the monthly Cost of Insurance by multiplying  the  applicable  Cost of
Insurance Rate by the Net Amount at Risk for each Policy Month.                 

COST OF  INSURANCE  RATE.  The Annual Cost of  Insurance  Rates are based on the
Issue Age, sex and risk class of each Insured and the Policy duration. The rates
will vary depending  upon tobacco use and other risk factors.  The rates will be
based on Ameritas'  expectations of future  experience with regard to mortality,
interest,  persistency,  and  expenses,  but will not  exceed  the  Schedule  of
Guaranteed  Annual Cost of Insurance  Rates shown in the Policy.  The guaranteed
rates for standard  rating  classes are calculated  from the 1980  Commissioners
Standard Ordinary Smoker and Non-Smoker,  Male and Female Mortality Tables.  The
guaranteed  rates  for the  table-rated  substandard  Insureds  are  based  on a
multiple  (shown  in the  schedule  pages of the  Policy)  of the  above  rates.
One-half  the  amount of any Flat  Extra  Rating  Charge is added to the Cost of
Insurance  Rate and thus will be deducted as part of the  Monthly  Deduction  on
each Monthly Activity Date. Any change in the Cost of Insurance Rates will apply
to all Insureds of the same age, sex, risk class and whose Policies have been in
effect for the same length of time.                                             

The Cost of Insurance  Rates and payment options for Policies issued in Montana,
and  perhaps  other  states  or in  connection  with  certain  employee  benefit
arrangements,  are issued on a sex-neutral (unisex) basis. The unisex rates will
be higher than those  applicable  to females and lower than those  applicable to
males.  The actual  charges  made  during  the Policy  year will be shown in the
annual report delivered to Policy Owners.                                       

RATING CLASS. The rating class of each Insured will affect the Cost of Insurance
Rate.  Ameritas  currently places Insureds into both standard rating classes and
substandard rating classes that involve a higher mortality risk. In an otherwise
identical  Policy,  Insureds in the standard rating class will have a lower Cost
of Insurance  Rate than when either or both  Insureds are in a rating class with
higher mortality risks.

TRANSFER CHARGE. Currently there is no charge for transfers among the investment
options  in excess of 15 per Policy  Year.  A charge of $10  (guaranteed  not to
increase)  for each  transfer  in  excess  of 15 may be  imposed  to  compensate
Ameritas for the costs of processing the transfer.  Since the charge  reimburses
Ameritas only for the cost of processing the transfer,  Ameritas does not expect
to make any profit from the  transfer  charge.  This charge will be deducted pro
rata from each Subaccount  (and, if applicable,  the Fixed Account) in which the
Policy Owner is invested.  The transfer  charge will not be imposed on transfers
that occur as a result of Policy loans or the exercise of exchange rights.      

PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL CHARGE. A charge will be imposed for each partial withdrawal.
This charge will compensate Ameritas for the administrative  costs of processing
the requested payment and in making necessary calculations for any reductions in
Specified Amount which may be required because of the partial  withdrawal.  This
charge is currently the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn  (guaranteed
not to be  greater  than the lesser of $50 or 2% of the  amount  withdrawn).  No
partial withdrawal charge is assessed when a Policy is Surrendered.             

DAILY CHARGES AGAINST THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

A daily Mortality and Expense Risk Charge will be deducted from the value of the
net assets of Separate  Account LLVL to  compensate  Ameritas for  mortality and
expense  risks  assumed in  connection  with the Policy.  This daily charge from
Separate Account LLVL is at the rate of 0.001093%  (equivalent to an annual rate
of .40%) for Policy Years 1-15 and  0.000273%  (equivalent  to an annual rate of
 .10%) thereafter. The daily charge will be deducted from the net asset value of
Separate  Account LLVL, and therefore the  Subaccounts,  on each Valuation Date.
Where the previous day or days was not a Valuation  Date,  the  deduction on the
Valuation  Date will be the  applicable  daily rate  multiplied by the number of
days since the last  Valuation  Date. No Mortality and Expense Risk Charges will
be deducted from the amounts in the Fixed Account.                              

Ameritas  believes  that this  level of charge is within  the range of  industry
practice for comparable  survivorship  flexible premium variable  universal life
policies. The mortality risk assumed by Ameritas is that Insureds may live for a
shorter time than  calculated,  and that the aggregate  amount of Death Benefits
paid will be greater than initially estimated.  The expense risk assumed is that
expenses  incurred in issuing and  administering  the  policies  will exceed the
administrative charges provided in the policies.                                

An  Asset-Based  Administrative  Expense  Charge will also be deducted  from the
value of the net assets of Separate  Account LLVL on a daily basis.  This charge
is applied at a rate of 0.000546% (equivalent to .20% annually).  No Asset-Based
Administrative  Expense  Charge will be  deducted  from the amounts in the Fixed
Account.                                                                        

FUND EXPENSE SUMMARY 

Fee information relating to the underlying funds was provided to Ameritas by the
underlying  funds.  Ameritas  has not  independently  verified  the  information
received from the underlying funds.                                             

Neuberger  Berman  Advisers  Management  Trust (the  "Trust")  is  divided  into
portfolios  ("Portfolios"),  each of  which  invests  all of its net  investable
assets in a corresponding  series  ("Series") of the Trust. The figures reported
under "Investment

Advisory & Management"  include the aggregate of the administration fees paid by
the  Portfolio  and  the  management  fees  paid  by its  corresponding  Series.
Similarly, "Other Expenses" includes all other expenses of the Portfolio and its
corresponding Series.                                                           

Neuberger  Berman  Management,  Inc.  ("NBMI")  provides  investment  management
services  to  each  Series  that  include,   among  other  things,   making  and
implementing   investment  decisions  and  providing  facilities  and  personnel
necessary to operate the Series. NBMI provides  administrative  services to each
Portfolio  that  include  furnishing  similar  facilities  and  personnel to the
Portfolio.  With the Portfolio's consent, NBMI is authorized to subcontract some
of its responsibilities under its administration agreement with the Portfolio to
third parties.                                                                  

Each Portfolio  bears all expenses of its  operations  other than those borne by
NBMI as  administrator  of the Portfolio and as distributor of its shares.  Each
Series  bears all expenses of its  operations  other than those borne by NBMI as
investment  manager of the Series.  These expenses include,  but are not limited
to,  for  the  Portfolios  and  the  Series,   legal  and  accounting  fees  and
compensation  for trustees who are not affiliated with NBMI; for the Portfolios,
transfer  agent fees and the cost of  printing  and  sending  reports  and proxy
materials to  shareholders;  and for the Series,  custodial fees for securities.
Any  expenses  which are not  directly  attributable  to a  specific  Series are
allocated on the basis of the net assets of the respective Series.              

NBMI has  undertaken  to reimburse  certain  operating  expenses,  including the
compensation  of NBMI and excluding  taxes,  interest,  extraordinary  expenses,
brokerage  commissions and transaction costs, that exceed, in the aggregate,  1%
of the Liquid Asset  Portfolio's  average  daily net asset  value.  This expense
reimbursement agreement is subject to termination upon 60 days written notice.  

The effect of any expense  limitation by NBMI is to reduce operating expenses of
a portfolio and its corresponding Series and thereby increase total return.     

Berger Associates  provides investment advisory services to the Berger IPT Funds
available in Separate  Account LLVL.  Berger  Associates has agreed to waive its
advisory fee and reimburse the Funds for additional  expenses to the extent that

excluding brokerage commissions,  interest, taxes and extraordinary expenses, of
Berger  IPT-100  Fund exceed  1.00%,  and the normal  operating  expenses in any
fiscal year of the Berger  IPT-Small  Company  Growth Fund exceed 1.15%,  of the
respective Fund's average daily net assets.

Expense  reimbursement  agreements  are expected to continue in future years but
may be terminated at any time. as long as the expense limitations continue for a
portfolio,  if a  reimbursement  occurs,  it has  the  effect  of  lowering  the

Ameritas may receive administrative fees from the investment advisers of certain
Funds.  Ameritas  currently does not assess a separate  charge against  Separate
Account LLVL or the Fixed Account for any federal,  state or local income taxes.
Ameritas  may,  however,  make  such a charge  in the  future if income or gains
within Separate Account LLVL will incur any federal, or any significant state or
local income tax liability,  or if the federal,  state or local tax treatment of
Ameritas changes.                                                               

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

THE CONTRACT. The Policy, the application,  any supplemental  applications,  and
any riders,  amendments or endorsements  make up the entire  contract.  Only the
President,  Vice  President,  Secretary  or Assistant  Secretary  can modify the
Policy. Any changes must be made in writing, and approved by Ameritas.  No agent
has the authority to alter or modify any of the terms,  conditions or agreements
of the Policy or to waive any of its  provisions.  The rights and benefits under
the Policy are  summarized in this  prospectus;  however  prospectus  disclosure
regarding the Policy is qualified in its entirety by the Policy  itself,  a copy
of which is available upon request from Ameritas.                               

CONTROL OF POLICY. The Policy Owner is as shown in the application or subsequent
written  endorsement.  Subject to the rights of any irrevocable  Beneficiary and
any assignee of record, all rights, options, and privileges belong to the Policy
Owner,  if  living;  otherwise  to any  successor-owner  or  owners,  if living;
otherwise to the estate of the last Policy Owner to die.                        

LLSVUL

P-->S-640th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
BENEFICIARY. Policy Owners may name both primary and contingent Beneficiaries in
the application. Payments will be shared equally among Beneficiaries of the same
class unless  otherwise  stated.  If a Beneficiary dies before the Second Death,
payments  will  be  made  to any  surviving  Beneficiaries  of the  same  class;
otherwise to any Beneficiaries of the next class; otherwise to the Policy Owner;
otherwise to the estate of the Policy Owner.                                    

CHANGE OF  BENEFICIARY.  The Policy Owner may change the  Beneficiary by written
request  at any time  while at  least  one  Insured  is alive  unless  otherwise
provided in the previous designation of Beneficiary. The change will take effect
as of the date the change is recorded at the Home Office.  Ameritas  will not be
liable for any payment made or action taken before the change is recorded.      

CHANGE OF POLICY OWNER OR ASSIGNMENT. In order to change the Policy Owner of the
Policy or assign  Policy  rights,  an  assignment  of the Policy must be made in
writing  and filed with  Ameritas at its Home  Office.  Any such  assignment  is
subject to  Outstanding  Policy Debt. The change will take effect as of the date
the change is recorded at the Home Office,  and Ameritas  will not be liable for
any payment made or action taken before the change is recorded. Payment of Death
Benefit  Proceeds  is  subject  to the  rights  of any  assignee  of  record.  A
collateral assignment is not a change of ownership.                             

PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS. The Death Benefit Proceeds are subject first to any debt to
Ameritas and then to the interest of any assignee of record.  The balance of any
Death Benefit  Proceeds shall be paid in one sum to the  designated  beneficiary
unless an Optional Method of Payment is selected.  If no Beneficiary survives at
the time of the Second Death,  the Death Benefit  Proceeds  shall be paid in one
sum to the Policy Owner, if living; otherwise to any successor-owner, if living;
otherwise to the Policy  Owner's  estate.  Any proceeds  payable upon  Surrender
shall be paid in one sum unless an Optional Method of Payment is elected.       

INCONTESTABILITY.  Ameritas cannot contest the Policy or reinstated Policy while
at least one  Insured is alive after it has been in force for two years from the
Policy Date (or reinstatement  effective date). After the Policy Date,  Ameritas
cannot contest an increase in the Specified  Amount or addition of a rider while
at least one Insured is alive, after such increase or addition has been in force
for two years from its effective  date.  However,  this two year provision shall
not apply to riders  with their own  contestability  provision.  We may  require
proof  prior  to the end of the  appropriate  contestability  period  that  both
Insureds are living.                                                            

MISSTATEMENT  OF AGE AND SEX. If the age or sex of either  Insured or any person
insured by rider has been  misstated,  the amount of the Death  Benefit  and any
added riders  provided  will be those that would be purchased by the most recent
deduction for the Cost of Insurance and the cost of any additional riders at the
correct age and sex of the Insureds. The Death Benefit Proceeds will be adjusted
correspondingly.                                                                

SUICIDE.  The Policy does not cover suicide  within two years of the Policy Date
unless otherwise  provided by a state's Insurance law. If either Insured,  while
sane or insane, commits suicide within two years after the Policy Date, Ameritas
will pay only the premiums received less any partial  withdrawals,  the cost for
riders and any outstanding Policy debt. If either Insured, while sane or insane,
commits suicide within two years after the effective date of any increase in the
Specified Amount, Ameritas' liability with respect to such increase will only be
its total cost of insurance  applicable  to the  increase.  The laws of Missouri
provide that death by suicide at any time is covered by the Policy,  and further
that suicide by an insane person may be considered an accidental death.         

POSTPONEMENT  OF  PAYMENTS.  Payment  of  any  amount  upon  Surrender,  partial
withdrawal,  Policy loans,  benefits  payable at the Second Death, and transfers
may be  postponed  whenever:  (1) the New York Stock  Exchange  (NYSE) is closed
other than  customary  weekend and holiday  closings,  or trading on the NYSE is
restricted as  determined by the SEC; (2) the SEC by order permits  postponement
for the protection of Policy Owners;  (3) an emergency  exists, as determined by
the  SEC,  as a  result  of  which  disposal  of  securities  is not  reasonably
practicable  or it is not  reasonably  practicable  to  determine  the  value of
Separate  Account  LLVL's  net  assets;  or (4)  Surrenders,  loans  or  partial
withdrawals  from the Fixed  Account may be deferred for up to 6 months from the
date of written  request.  Payments under the Policy of any amounts derived from
premiums  paid by check may be delayed  until such time as the check has cleared
the Policy Owners bank.                                                         

REPORTS AND RECORDS.  Ameritas  will  maintain all records  relating to Separate
Account  LLVL and will mail to the Policy  Owner,  at the last known  address of
record,  within 30 days after each Policy  Anniversary,  an annual  report which
shows the current  Accumulation  Value, Net Cash Surrender Value, Death Benefit,
premiums  paid,  Outstanding  Policy  Debt  and  other  information.   Quarterly
statements  are also  mailed  detailing  Policy  activity  during  the  calendar
quarter.  Instead of receiving an immediate  confirmation of  transactions  made
pursuant to some types of periodic payment plan (such as a dollar cost averaging
program,   or  payment  made  by  automatic  bank  draft  or  salary            

LLSVUL

reduction  arrangement),  the  Policy  Owner may  receive  confirmation  of such
transactions in their quarterly  statements.  The Policy Owner should review the
information in these  statements  carefully.  All errors or corrections  must be
reported to  Ameritas  immediately  to assure  proper  crediting  to the Policy.
Ameritas  will assume all  transactions  are  accurately  reported on  quarterly
statements unless Ameritas is notified otherwise within 30 days after receipt of
the  statement.  The Policy  Owner  will also be sent a periodic  report for the
Funds  and a list of the  portfolio  securities  held in each  portfolio  of the
Funds.                                                                          

ADDITIONAL INSURANCE BENEFITS (RIDERS.) Subject to certain requirements,  one or
more of the following  additional insurance benefits may be added to a Policy by
rider.  All  riders  are not  available  in all  states.  The cost,  if any,  of
additional insurance benefits will be deducted as part of the Monthly Deduction.
(See the section on Charges From Accumulation Value - Monthly Deduction.)       

ACCELERATED  BENEFIT RIDER FOR TERMINAL  ILLNESS  (LIVING  BENEFIT  RIDER.) Upon
Satisfactory  Proof of Death of one Insured,  and satisfactory proof of terminal
illness of the  surviving  Insured  after the  two-year  contestable  period (no
waiting period in certain states), Ameritas will accelerate the payment of up to
50% of the lowest  scheduled  Death  Benefit as provided by eligible  coverages,
less an amount up to two guideline level premiums.                              

Future premium allocations after the payment of the benefit must be allocated to
the Fixed Account. Payment will not be made for amounts less than $4,000 or more
than $250,000 on all policies  issued by Ameritas or its affiliates that provide
coverage on the surviving  Insured.  Ameritas may charge the lesser of 2% of the
benefit or $50 as an expense charge to cover the costs of administration.       

Satisfactory  proof of  terminal  illness  of the last  surviving  Insured  must
include a written statement from a licensed  physician who is not related to the
Insured or the Policy  Owner  stating  that the  Insured  has a  non-correctable
medical  condition that,  with a reasonable  degree of medical  certainty,  will
result in the death of the  Insured  in less than 12 months (6 months in certain
states) from the date of the physician's statement.  Further, the condition must
first be diagnosed while the Policy is in force.                                

The accelerated benefit first will be used to repay any Outstanding Policy Debt,
and will also affect future loans,  partial  withdrawals,  and  Surrenders.  The
accelerated  benefit will be treated as a lien against the Policy Death  Benefit
and will thus reduce the Death  Benefit  Proceeds.  Interest on the lien will be
charged at the Policy loan  interest  rate.  There is no extra  premium for this
rider.                                                                          

ESTATE  PROTECTION RIDER. This rider provides a specified amount of insurance to
the  Beneficiary  upon receipt of  Satisfactory  Proof of Death of both Insureds

DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICIES 

Ameritas  Investment Corp. (AIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMAL Corporation,

under the laws of the State of Nebraska on December 29, 1983 and is a registered
broker-dealer  pursuant to the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of
the National  Association  of Securities  Dealers.  In 1998,  AIC received gross
variable  universal  life  compensation  of $298,182,  and  retained  $37,512 in
underwriting  fees,  and $10 in  brokerage  commissions  on  Ameritas'  variable
universal life policies.                                                        

AIC offers its clients a wide variety of financial products and services and has
the  ability  to execute  stock and bond  transactions  on a number of  national
exchanges.  AIC also serves as  principal  underwriter  for  Ameritas'  variable
annuities,  and for Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company's variable life and
variable  annuities.  It also has executed selling  agreements with a variety of
mutual funds, unit investment trusts and direct participation programs.         

There is no premium load to cover sales and distribution expenses. To the extent
that sales and distribution expenses are paid, if at all, Ameritas will pay them
from its other assets or surplus in its General  Account,  which include amounts
derived from mortality and expense risk charges and other charges made under the
Policy.                                                                         

Policies can be purchased  directly  from Ameritas  through its direct  consumer
services, with salaried employees who are registered  representatives of AIC and
who will not receive compensation related to the purchase.                      

Policies  can  be  purchased  from  field  representatives  who  are  registered
representatives  of AIC, or from registered  representatives of other registered
broker-dealers  authorized to sell the policies  subject to  applicable  law. In
these situations,  AIC or the other broker-dealer may receive compensation in an
amount no greater  than 15% of the target first year premium paid plus the first
year cost of any riders,  and 2% of excess first year premium.  AIC or the other
broker-dealer  may pass a  portion  of this  compensation  on to the  registered
representative or the manager of the registered representative.                 

Upon any subsequent  increase in Specified Amount or any subsequent  increase in
riders,  marketing  allowances  will  also be paid  based on the  amount  of the
increase in Specified Amount or increase in rider.                              

FEDERAL TAX MATTERS 

The following  discussion  provides a general  description of the federal income
tax  considerations  associated  with the  Policy  and does  not  purport  to be
complete or cover all situations. This discussion is not intended as tax advice.
No attempt has been made to consider in detail any applicable state or other tax
(except  premium  taxes,  see the section on Deductions  from Premium  Payments)
laws. This discussion is based upon Ameritas' understanding of the relevant laws
at the time of  filing.  Counsel  and other  competent  tax  advisors  should be
consulted for more complete

information before a Policy is purchased. Ameritas makes no representation as to
the likelihood of the continuation of present federal income tax laws nor of the
interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service. Federal tax laws are subject to
change and thus tax consequences to the Insureds,Policy Owner or Beneficiary may
be altered.                                                                     

(1)  TAXATION OF AMERITAS.  Ameritas is taxed as a life insurance  company under
     Part I of  Subchapter L of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").
     At this time,  since  Separate  Account LLVL is not a separate entity  from
     Ameritas,  and its operations form a part of Ameritas, it will not be taxed
     separately as a "regulated  investment  company" under  Subchapter M of the
     Code. Net investment income and realized net capital gains on the assets of
     Separate Account LLVL are reinvested and  automatically  retained as a part
     of the reserves of the Policy and are taken into account in determining the
     Death Benefit and Accumulation Value of the Policy.  Ameritas believes that
     Separate Account LLVL net investment  income and realized net capital gains
     will not be taxable to the extent that such  income and gains are  retained
as reserves under the Policy.                                         

     Ameritas does not currently  expect to incur any additional  federal income
     tax  liability attributable  to Separate Account LLVL  with  respect to the
     sale of the Policies.  Accordingly,  no charge  is being made  currently to
     Separate  Account LLVL  for  federal income taxes.  If,  however,  Ameritas
     determines that it  may incur such  taxes  attributable to Separate Account
    LLVL, it may assess a charge for such taxes against Separate Account LLVL.

     Ameritas may also incur state and local taxes (in addition to premium taxes
     for which a deduction from premiums is currently  made).  At present,  they
     are  not charges against  Separate Account LLVL.  If  there  is  a material
     change in state or local tax laws, charges for such taxes  attributable  to
     Separate Account LLVL,  if  any, may  be  assessed against Separate Account
LLVL.                                                                 

(2)  TAX STATUS OF THE POLICY.  The Code (Section 7702) includes a definition of
     a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes which places limitations
     on the  amount  of  premiums  that  may be  paid  for  the  Policy  and the
     relationship of the Accumulation Value to the Death Benefit. While Ameritas
     believes that the Policy meets the statutory definition of a life insurance
     contract  under  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  7702 and should  receive
     federal income tax treatment  consistent with that of a fixed-benefit  life
     insurance  policy,  the area of tax law relating to the  definition of life
     insurance does not explicitly address all relevant issues  (including,  for
     example,   certain  tax  requirements  relating  to  survivorship  variable
     universal life  policies).  Ameritas  reserves the right to make changes to
     the  Policy  if  deemed  appropriate  by  Ameritas  to  attempt  to  assure
     qualification  of the Policy as a life  insurance  contract.  If the Policy
     were  determined not to qualify as life insurance  under Code Section 7702,
     the Policy would not provide the tax advantages  normally  provided by life
     insurance.  If the Death  Benefit of a Policy is  changed,  the  applicable
defined limits may change.                                            

     The Code (Section 7702A) also defines a "modified  endowment  contract" for
     federal  tax  purposes.  If a life  insurance  policy  is  classified  as a
     modified  endowment  contract,  distributions from it (including loans) are
     taxed as ordinary income to the extent of any gain. This Policy will become
     a "modified  endowment  contract" if the premiums paid into the Policy fail
     to meet a 7-pay  premium  test as  outlined  in Section  7702A of the Code.
     Basically,  Section  7702A  of  the  Code  defines  a  "modified  endowment
     contract"  as a policy  issued or  materially  changed on or after June 21,
     1988 on which the total  premiums  paid during the first seven years exceed
     the amount  that would  have been paid if the Policy  provided  for paid up
benefits after seven level annual premiums.                           

     Certain  benefits  the  Policy  Owner may elect  under  this  Policy may be
     material  changes that affect or cause  retesting  under the 7-pay  premium
     test. These include,  but are not limited to, changes in Death Benefits and
     changes in the Specified Amount. One may avoid a Policy becoming a modified
     endowment contract by, among other things, not making excessive payments or
     reducing  benefits.  Should you deposit excessive  premiums during a Policy
     Year,  that portion  that is returned by Ameritas  within 60 days after the
     Policy Anniversary Date will reduce the premiums paid to prevent the Policy
     from  becoming  a  modified  endowment  contract.  All  modified  endowment
     policies issued by Ameritas to the same Policy Owner in any 12 month period
     are treated as one modified  endowment contract for purposes of determining
     taxable gain under  Section 72(e) of the Internal  Revenue  Code.  Any life
     insurance  policy  received in exchange for a modified  endowment  contract
     will also be treated as a modified endowment contract. You should contact a
     competent  tax  professional  before paying  additional  premiums or making
     other  changes to the Policy to determine  whether such payments or changes
would cause the Policy to become a modified endowment contract.       

     The Code  (Section  817(h)) also  authorizes  the Secretary of the Treasury
     (the  "Treasury")  to set  standards by  regulation  or  otherwise  for the
     investments  of Separate  Account LLVL to be  "adequately  diversified"  in
order                                                                 

LLSVUL

     for  the  Policy to  be  treated  as a  life insurance contract for federal
     tax purposes.  Separate Account LLVL, through the Funds,  intends to comply
     with  the  diversification  requirements  prescribed  by  the  Treasury  in
     regulations  published  in the  Federal  Register  on March 2, 1989,  which
affect how the Fund's assets may be invested.                         

     Ameritas  does  not have  control  over  the  Funds  or their  investments.
     However,  Ameritas  believes  that the Funds will be operated in compliance
     with the  diversification  requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus,
     Ameritas believes  that  the Policy will  be  treated as  a life  insurance
contract for federal tax purposes.                                    

     In   connection   with  the  issuance  of   regulations   relating  to  the
     diversification requirements,  the Treasury announced that such regulations
     do not provide  guidance  concerning  the extent to which Policy Owners may
     direct their  investments  to particular  divisions of a separate  account.
     Regulations  in this  regard may be issued in the  future.  It is not clear
     what these  regulations  will provide nor whether they will be  prospective
     only. It is possible that when regulations are issued,  the Policy may need
     to be modified to comply with such regulations. For these reasons, Ameritas
     reserves  the right to modify the Policy as necessary to prevent the Policy
     Owner from being  considered  the owner of the assets of  Separate  Account
     LLVL or otherwise to qualify the Policy for  favorable tax  treatment.  The
     following  discussion  assumes  that  the  Policy  will  qualify  as a life
insurance contract for federal tax purposes.                          

(3)  TAX TREATMENT OF POLICY PROCEEDS. Ameritas believes that the Policy will be
     treated in a manner  consistent with a fixed benefit life insurance  policy
     for federal  income tax purposes.  Thus,  Ameritas  believes that the Death
     Benefit  will  generally  be  excludable  from  the  gross  income  of  the
     Beneficiary  under Section  101(a)(1) of the Code and the Policy Owner will
     not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the Accumulation Value under
the Policy until its actual Surrender.                                

     Distributions  From Policies That Are Not "Modified  Endowment  Contracts."
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Distributions  (while one or both  Insureds  are still alive) from a Policy
     that is not a modified  endowment contract are generally treated as first a
     recovery of the  investment in the Policy and then only after the return of
     all such investment,  as disbursing taxable income. However, in the case of
     a decrease in the Death Benefit,  a partial  withdrawal,  a change in Death
     Benefit option, or any other such change that reduces future benefits under
     the  Policy  during  the first 15 years  after a Policy is issued  and that
     results in a cash  distribution to the Policy Owner in order for the Policy
     to continue  complying with the Section 7702 defined limits on premiums and
     Accumulation  Values, such distributions will be taxable as ordinary income
     to the Policy Owner (to the extent of any gain in the Policy) as prescribed
     in Section  7702.  In  addition,  upon a complete  surrender  or lapse of a
     Policy that is not a "modified endowment  contract," if the amount received
     plus the amount of any outstanding Policy Debt exceeds the total investment
     in the Policy,  the excess will generally be treated as ordinary income for
     tax  purposes.  Investment  in the Policy means (1) the total amount of any
     premiums paid for the Policy plus the amount of any loan received under the
     Policy to the extent  the loan is  included  in gross  income of the Policy
     owner minus (2) the total  amount  received  under the Policy by the Policy
     Owner that was excludable from gross income, excluding any non-taxable loan
received under the Policy.                                            

     Ameritas  also believes  that loans  received  under a Policy that is not a
     "modified  endowment  contract" will be treated as debt of the Policy Owner
     and that no part of any loan under a Policy will  constitute  income to the
     Policy  Owner so long as the  Policy  remains  in force.  Should the Policy
     lapse  while  Policy  loans  are  outstanding  the  portion  of  the  loans
     attributable to earnings will become taxable.  Generally,  interest paid on
    any loan under a Policy owned by an individual will not be tax-deductible.

     Except for Policies  with respect to a limited  number of key persons of an
     employer  (both as defined in the Internal  Revenue  Code),  and subject to
     applicable  interest  rate  caps,  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and
     Accountability  Act of 1996 (the "Health  Insurance Act") generally repeals
     the  deduction for interest paid or accrued after October 13, 1995 on loans
     from  corporate  owned life  insurance  Policies on the lives of  officers,
     employees or persons  financially  interested  in the  taxpayer's  trade or
     business.  Certain transitional rules for existing debt are included in the
     Health  Insurance  Act. The  transitional  rules include a phase-out of the
     deduction  for debt  incurred  (1) before  January  1, 1996,  or (2) before
     January 1, 1997,  for Policies  entered into in 1994 or 1995. The phase-out
     of the interest expense  deduction occurs over a transition  period between
     October  13,  1995 and  January 1, 1999.  There is also a special  rule for
     pre-June 21, 1986  Policies.  The Taxpayer  Relief Act of 1997 ("TRA '97"),
     further  expanded the interest  deduction  disallowance  for  businesses by
     providing,  with  respect to Policies  issued  after June 8, 1997,  that no
     deduction is allowed for interest  paid or accrued on any debt with respect
     to life  insurance  covering  the life of any  individual  (except as noted
     above under  pre-'97 law with respect to key persons and pre- June 21, 1986
     policies).  TRA '97 also  provides  that no  deduction is  permissible  for
premiums  paid on a life

     insurance  Policy if the  taxpayer is directly or indirectly a  Beneficiary
     under the Policy.  Also under TRA '97 and  subject  to certain  exceptions,
     for Policies issued after June 8, 1997, no deduction  is  allowed  for that
     portion of a  taxpayer's  interest expense  that is allocable to unborrowed
     Policy cash values.  This disallowance generally does not apply to Policies
     owned by  natural  persons.  Policy Owners should  consult a  competent tax
     advisor  concerning  the  tax  implications  of  these  changes  for  their
Policies.                                                             

     Distributions From Policies That Are "Modified Endowment Contracts." Should
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
     the Policy become a "modified endowment contract" partial withdrawals, full
     Surrenders, assignments, pledges, and  loans (including loans  to  pay loan
     interest)  under the  Policy will  be taxable to  the  extent of  any  gain
     under the Policy.  A 10% penalty tax also applies to the taxable portion of
     any  distribution  prior to the  taxpayer's age 59 1/2. The 10% penalty tax
     does not apply if the distribution is made because the taxpayer is disabled
     as defined under the Code or if the distribution is paid out in the form of
     a life  annuity  on the  life of the  taxpayer  or the  joint  lives of the
taxpayer and Beneficiary.                                             

     The right to  exchange  the  Policy  for a  survivorship  flexible  premium
     adjustable life insurance policy (See the section on Exchange  Privilege.),
     the right to change Policy Owners (See the section on General Provisions.),
     and the provision for partial  withdrawals (See the section on Surrenders.)
     may have tax consequences  depending on the circumstances of such exchange,
     change, or withdrawal. Upon complete Surrender, if the amount received plus
     any Outstanding  Policy Debt exceeds the total premiums paid (the "basis"),
     that are not  treated as  previously  withdrawn  by the Policy  Owner,  the
excess generally will be taxed as ordinary income.                    

     Federal  estate  and  state and local  estate,  inheritance,  and other tax
     consequences  of ownership or receipt of Death Benefit  Proceeds  depend on
     applicable law and the  circumstances  of each Policy Owner or Beneficiary.
     In  addition,  if the  Policy  is used  in  connection  with  tax-qualified
     retirement plans,  certain  limitations  prescribed by the Internal Revenue
     Service  on, and rules with  respect to the  taxation  of,  life  insurance
     protection  provided  through such plans may apply. The advice of competent
     tax counsel should be sought in connection  with use of life insurance in a
qualified plan.                                                       

SAFEKEEPING OF THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT'S ASSETS 

Ameritas  holds  the  assets of  Separate  Account  LLVL.  The  assets  are kept
physically  segregated and held  separately  and apart from the General  Account
assets,  except  for  the  Fixed  Account.  Ameritas  maintains  records  of all
purchases and redemptions of Funds' shares by each of the Subaccounts.          

THIRD PARTY SERVICES 

Ameritas is aware that certain third parties are offering  investment  advisory,
asset  allocation,  money  management and timing services in connection with the
Policies. Ameritas does not engage any such third parties to offer such services
of  any  type.  In  certain  cases,   Ameritas  has  agreed  to  honor  transfer
instructions  from such services where it has received powers of attorney,  in a
form  acceptable  to it, from the Policy  Owners  participating  in the service.
Firms or persons  offering  such  services do so  independently  from any agency
relationship  they may have with  Ameritas  for the sale of  Policies.  Ameritas
takes no responsibility for the investment  allocations and transfers transacted
on a Policy Owner's  behalf by such third parties or any  investment  allocation
recommendations  made by such  parties.  Policy Owners should be aware that fees
paid for such  services  are  separate  and in  addition  to fees paid under the
Policies.                                                                       

VOTING RIGHTS 

Ameritas is the legal holder of the shares held in the  Subaccounts  of Separate
Account LLVL and as such has the right to vote the shares, to elect Directors of
the Funds,  and to vote on matters that are required by the  Investment  Company
Act of 1940 and upon any other matter that may be voted upon at a shareholders's
meeting. To the extent required by law, Ameritas will vote all shares of each of
the Funds held in  Separate  Account  LLVL at regular  and  special  shareholder
meetings of the Funds  according to  instructions  received  from Policy  Owners
based on the number of shares held as of the record date for such meeting.      

The number of Fund shares in a Subaccount for which instructions may be given by
a Policy Owner is  determined  by dividing the  Accumulation  Value held in that
Subaccount by the net asset value of one share in the corresponding portfolio of
the Fund. Fractional shares will be counted. Fund shares held in each Subaccount
for which no timely instructions from Policy Owners are received and Fund shares
held in each  Subaccount  which do not support  Policy Owner  interests  will be
voted by Ameritas in the same  proportion as those shares in that Subaccount for
which                                                                           

LLSVUL
42

P-->S-646th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
timely  instructions  are  received.  Voting  instructions  to  abstain  on  any
item to be voted  will be  applied  on a pro  rata  basis to  reduce  the  votes
eligible to be cast.  Should applicable  federal  securities laws or regulations
permit, Ameritas may elect to vote shares of the Fund in its own right.         

DISREGARD OF VOTING  INSTRUCTION.  Ameritas may, if required by state  insurance
officials,  disregard voting  instructions if those  instructions  would require
shares  to be voted to cause a change  in the  subclassification  or  investment
objectives or policies of one or more of the Funds' portfolios, or to approve or
disapprove  an investment  adviser or principal  underwriter  for the Funds.  In
addition,  Ameritas itself may disregard voting  instructions that would require
changes in the  investment  objectives  or  policies of any  portfolio  or in an
investment  adviser  or  principal   underwriter  for  the  Funds,  if  Ameritas
reasonably  disapproves  those changes in  accordance  with  applicable  federal
regulations.  If Ameritas does  disregard  voting  instructions,  it will advise
Policy  Owners of that  action and its reasons for the action in the next annual
report or proxy statement to Policy Owners.                                     

STATE REGULATION OF AMERITAS 

Ameritas,  a stock life insurance  company organized under the laws of Nebraska,
is subject to regulation by the Nebraska  Department of Insurance.  On or before
March 1 of each  year an NAIC  convention  blank  covering  the  operations  and
reporting on the financial condition of Ameritas and Separate Account LLVL as of
December 31 of the preceding year must be filed with the Nebraska  Department of
Insurance.  Periodically,  the Nebraska  Department  of  Insurance  examines the
liabilities and reserves of Ameritas and Separate Account LLVL.                 

In addition,  Ameritas is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of other
states  within  which it is  licensed or may become  licensed  to  operate.  The

AMERITAS LIFE INSURANCE CORP. 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT LLVL 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         

Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. Separate Account LLVL (the Account) was           
established under Nebraska law on August 24, 1994. The assets of the Account are
held by Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. (ALIC) and are aggregated from all of     
ALIC's other assets.                                                            

The Account is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, 
as a unit investment trust. At December 31, 1998, there are fifteen subaccounts 
within the Account. Nine of the subaccounts invest only in a corresponding      
Portfolio of the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund which is a diversified        
open-end management investment company managed by The Vanguard Group. Four of   
the subaccounts invest only in a corresponding Portfolio of the Neuberger &     
Berman Advisers Management Trust which is a diversified open-end management     
investment company managed by Neuberger & Berman Management Incorporated. Two of
the subaccounts invest only in a corresponding Portfolio of the Berger          
Institutional Products Trust which is a diversified open-end management         
investment company managed by Berger Associates. Each Portfolio pays the manager
a monthly fee for managing its investments and business affairs. The assets of  
the Account are carried at the net asset value of the underlying Portfolios of  
the funds, and the value of the policyowners' units corresponds to the Account's
investment in the underlying subaccounts.                                       

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of         
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and   
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.      
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                               

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS                                                        

The assets of the account are carried at the net asset value of the underlying  
Portfolios of the Funds. The value of the policyowners' units corresponds to the
Account's investment in the underlying subaccounts. The availability of         
investment portfolio and subaccount options may vary between products. Share    
transactions and security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. 

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES                                                         

The operations of the Account are included in the federal income tax return of  
ALIC, which is taxed as a life insurance company under the Internal Revenue     
Code. ALIC has the right to charge the Account any federal income taxes, or     
provision for federal income taxes, attributable to the operations of the       
Account or to the policies funded in the Account. Currently, ALIC does not make 
a charge for income or other taxes. Charges for state and local taxes, if any,  
attributable to the Account may also be made.                                   

2. POLICYOWNER CHARGES                                                          

ALIC charges the account for mortality and expense risks assumed. A daily charge
is made on the average daily value of the net assets representing equity of     
policyowners held in each subaccount per each product's current policy          
provisions. Additional charges are made at intervals and in amounts per each    
product's current policy provisions. These charges are prorated against the     
balance in each investment option of the policyowner, including the Fixed       
Account option which is not reflected in this separate account.

AMERITAS LIFE INSURANCE CORP. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996
(IN THOUSANDS)
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         
ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS                                           

On September 13, 1997, the Board of Directors of Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.  
(Ameritas) adopted the Plan which authorized the reorganization (Reorganization)
of Ameritas into a mutual insurance holding company structure. The Nebraska     
Department of Insurance held a public hearing on the Reorganization on October
14, 1997 and approved the Plan on October 24, 1997. The policyowners' of        
Ameritas approved the Plan on December 8, 1997 and the Reorganization became    
effective on January 1, 1998 (effective date).                                  

Pursuant to the Reorganization, Ameritas (i) formed Ameritas Mutual Insurance   
Holding Company (AMHC) as a mutual insurance holding company under the insurance
laws of the State of Nebraska, (ii) formed Ameritas Holding Company (AHC) as an 
intermediate stock holding company under the general laws of the State of       
Nebraska, and (iii) amended and restated its Charter and Articles of            
Incorporation to authorize the issuance of capital stock and the continuance of 
its existence as a stock life insurance company under the same name. As of the  
effective date of the Reorganization, the membership interests and the          
contractual rights of the policyowners of Ameritas were separated -- the        
membership interests automatically became, by operation of law, membership      
interests in AMHC and the contractual rights remained in Ameritas. Each person  
who becomes the owner of a designated policy issued by Ameritas after the       
effective date of the Reorganization will become a member of AMHC and have a    
membership interest in AMHC so long as such policy remains in force. The        
membership interests in AMHC follow, and are not severable, from the policy from
which the membership interest in AMHC is derived.                               

On the effective date, Ameritas issued 25 million of its authorized shares of   
capital stock to AMHC. AMHC then contributed all of these to AHC in exchange for
20 million shares of its common stock. As a result, AHC directly owns Ameritas, 
and AMHC indirectly owns Ameritas, through AHC. The reorganization was accounted
for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.           
Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements and disclosures reflect the  
operations of Ameritas for all periods presented.                               

Ameritas' insurance operations consist of life and health insurance and annuity 
and pension contracts. Ameritas and its subsidiaries operates in all 50 states  
and the District of Columbia. Wholly owned insurance subsidiaries include First 
Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. Of New York and Pathmark Assurance Company.       
Ameritas is also a 66% owner of AMAL Corporation (incorporated March 8, 1996),  
which owns 100% of Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company and Ameritas        
Investment Corp. (a broker/dealer). In addition to the subsidiaries noted above,
Ameritas conducts other diversified financial-service-related operations through
the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Veritas Corp (a marketing organization 
for low-load insurance products); Ameritas Investment Advisors, Inc. (an advisor
providing investment management services); and Ameritas Managed Dental Plan,    
Inc. (A prepaid dental organization).                                           

CLOSED BLOCK                                                                    

Effective October 1, 1998 (the Effective Date) Ameritas formed a closed block   
(the Closed Block) of policies, under an arrangement approved by the Insurance  
Department of the State of Nebraska, to provide for dividends on policies that  
were in force on the Effective Date and which were within the classes of        
individual policies for which Ameritas had a dividend scale in effect on the    
Effective Date. The Closed Block was designed to give reasonable assurance to   
owners of affected policies that the assets will be available to support such   
policies including maintaining dividend scales in effect at the Effective Date, 
if the experience underlying such scales continues. The assets, including       
revenue thereon, will accrue solely to the benefit of the owners of policies    
included in the block until the block is no longer in effect.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION                                                     

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ameritas Life     
Insurance Corp. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company). These        
consolidated financial statements exclude the effects of all material           
intercompany transactions.                                                      

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with         
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and  
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated

POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)                                                   

financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during   
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.         

RECLASSIFICATIONS                                                               

Certain items on the prior year financial statements have been restated to      
conform to current year presentation.                                           

The principal accounting and reporting practices followed are:                  

INVESTMENTS                                                                     
The Company classifies its securities into categories based upon the Company's  
intent relative to the eventual disposition of the securities. The first        
category, held to maturity securities, includes fixed maturity securities which 
the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. These      
securities are carried at amortized cost. The second category, available for    
sale securities, may be sold to address the liquidity and other needs of the    
Company. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value  
on the balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations  
and reported as a separate component of stockholder's equity included in        
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related deferred acquisition     
costs and income tax effects. The third category, trading securities, is for    
debt and equity securities acquired for the purpose of selling them in the near 
term. The Company has not classified any of its securities as trading           
securities.                                                                     

Equity securities (common stock and nonredeemable preferred stock) are valued at
fair value, and are classified as available for sale.                           

Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at amortized cost less an allowance   
for estimated uncollectible amounts. SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for 
Impairment of a Loan," which was amended by SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by        
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and Disclosures,"      
requires that an impaired loan be measured at the present value of expected     
future cash flows, or alternatively, the observable market price or the fair    
value of the collateral. Total impaired loans as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, 
and the associated interest income were not material.                           

Investment real estate owned directly by the Company is carried at cost less    
accumulated depreciation and allowances for estimated losses. Real estate       
acquired through foreclosure is carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus
estimated costs to sell.                                                        

Other investments primarily include investments in venture capital partnerships 
and real estate joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, and       
securities owned by the broker dealer subsidiary valued at fair value. Changes  
in the fair value of the securities owned by the broker dealer are included in  
investment income.                                                              

Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair   
value.                                                                          

Realized investment gains and losses on sales of securities are determined on   
the specific identification method. Write-offs of investments that decline in   
value below cost on other than a temporary basis and the change in the          
allowances for mortgage loans and wholly owned real estate are included with    
realized gains in the consolidated statements of operations.                    

The Company records write-offs or allowances for its investments based upon an  
evaluation of specific problem investments. The Company reviews, on a continual 
basis, all invested assets to identify

investments where the Company may have credit concerns. Investments with credit 
concerns include those the Company has identified as experiencing a             
deterioration in financial condition.                                           

CASH EQUIVALENTS                                                                
The Company considers all highly liquid debt securities purchased with a        
remaining maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents.            

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT                                                          

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The   
Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using straight-line 
and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.          

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS                                                               
The Company operates separate accounts on which the earnings or losses accrue   
exclusively to contractholders. The assets (principally investments) and        
liabilities of each account are clearly identifiable and distinguishable from   
other assets and liabilities of the Company. The separate accounts are an       
investment alternative for pension, variable life, and variable annuity products
which the Company markets. Amounts are reported at fair value.

PREMIUM REVENUE AND BENEFITS TO POLICYOWNERS                                    
Participating life insurance products include those products with fixed and     
guaranteed premiums and benefits on which dividends are paid by the Company.    
Premiums on participating and term life products and certain annuities with life
contingencies (immediate annuities) are recognized as premium revenue when due. 
Accident and health insurance premiums are recognized as premium revenue over   
the time period to which the premiums relate. Benefits and expenses are         
associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over  
the premium-paying period of the contracts. This association is accomplished by 
means of the provision for liabilities for future policy benefits and the       
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.                              

RECOGNITION OF UNIVERSAL LIFE-TYPE CONTRACTS REVENUE AND BENEFITS TO            
POLICYOWNERS                                                                    
Universal life-type policies are insurance contracts with terms that are not    
fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed could include one or more of
the amounts assessed the policyowner, premiums paid by the policyowner or       
interest accrued to policyowners' balances. Amounts received as payments for    
such contracts are reflected as deposits in accumulated contract values and are 
not reported as premium revenues.                                               

Revenues for universal life-type policies consist of charges assessed against   
policy account values for deferred policy loading, mortality risk expense, the  
cost of insurance and policy administration. Policy benefits and claims that are
charged to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims    
incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances.

RECOGNITION OF INVESTMENT CONTRACT REVENUE AND BENEFITS TO POLICYOWNERS         
Contracts that do not subject the Company to risks arising from policyowner     
mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts. Deposit         
administration plans and certain deferred annuities are considered investment   
contracts. Amounts received as payments for such contracts are reflected as     
deposits in accumulated contract values and are not reported as premium         
revenues.                                                                       

Revenues for investment products consist of investment income and policy        
administration charges. Contract benefits that are charged to expense include   
benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related contract balances,   
and interest credited to contract balances.                                     

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS                                                        

Those costs of acquiring new business, which vary with and are directly related 
to the production of new business, have been deferred to the extent that such   
costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums. Such costs include           
commissions, certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and certain     
agency expenses.                                                                

Costs deferred related to term life insurance are amortized over the            
premium-paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of    
annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated 
premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing    
liabilities for future policy benefits.                                         

Costs deferred related to participating life, universal life-type policies and  
investment-type contracts are amortized generally over the lives of the         
policies, in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from      
mortality, investment and expense margins. The estimated gross profits are      
reviewed periodically based on actual experience and changes in assumptions.    

A roll-forward of the amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as   
deferred policy acquisition costs is as follows:

To the extent that unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  
would result in an adjustment of deferred policy acquisition costs had those    
gains or losses actually been realized, the related unamortized deferred policy 
acquisition costs are recorded as an adjustment of the unrealized investment    
gains or losses included in stockholder's equity.                               

FUTURE POLICY AND CONTRACT BENEFITS 

Liabilities for future policy benefits for participating and term life contracts
and additional coverages offered under policy riders are calculated using the   
net level premium method and assumptions as to investment yields, mortality,    
withdrawals and dividends. The assumptions are based on projections of past

assumptions are made at the time the contract is issued. These liabilities are  
shown as policy and contract reserves.                                          

Liabilities for future policy and contract benefits on universal life-type and  
investment-type contracts are based on the policy account balance, and are shown
as accumulated contract values.                                                 

The liabilities for future policy and contract benefits for group long-term     
disability reserves are based upon interest rate assumptions and morbidity and  
termination rates from published tables, modified for Company experience.       

DIVIDENDS TO POLICYOWNERS                                                       

A portion of the Company's business has been issued on a participating basis.   
The amount of policyowners' dividends to be paid is determined annually by the  
Board of Directors.                                                             

INCOME TAXES                                                                    

All companies included in these consolidated financial statements, with the     
exception of AMAL and its subsidiaries, files a consolidated life/non-life tax  
return. An agreement among the members of the consolidated group provides for   
distribution of consolidated tax results as if filed on a separate return basis.
The provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and deferred  
income taxes resulting from the cumulative differences in assets and liabilities
determined on a tax return and financial statement basis at the current enacted 
tax rates.                                                                      

Federal income tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service   
(IRS) through 1995. Management is currently appealing certain adjustments       
proposed by the IRS for tax years 1988 and 1990 through 1995, and believes      
adequate provisions have been made for any additional taxes which may become due
with respect to the adjustments proposed by the IRS.

The "surplus tax," IRC Section 809, is an imputation of income to mutual life   
insurance companies according to a formula based on a comparison of the returns 
of equity of the mutual and stock segments of the life insurance industry. The  
Company's provision for its surplus tax is based on the Company's best estimate 
of what its final surplus tax will be.

4. EMPLOYEE AND AGENT BENEFIT PLANS                                             
The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit plan covering substantially   
all employees. Plan benefits are based on years of credited service and the     
employee's compensation during the last five years of employment. The Company's 
funding policy is to make contributions each year at least equal to the minimum 
funding requirements for tax-qualified retirement plans. Pension costs include  
current service costs, which are accrued and funded on a current year basis, and
past service costs, which are amortized over the average remaining service life 
of all employees on the adoption date. The assets of the plan are not           
segregated.                                                                     

The Company also provides certain health care benefits to retired employees.    
These benefits are a specified percentage of premium until age 65 and a flat    
dollar amount thereafter. Employees become eligible for these benefits upon the 
attainment of age 55, 15 years of service and participation in the Company      
medical plan for the immediately preceding five years.                          

The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans'      
benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the two-year period ending    
December 31, 1998, and a statement of the funded status as of December 31 of    
both years:

The assumptions used in the measurement of the Company's benefit obligation are

The assumed health care trend line rate used in measuring the accumulated       
postretirement benefit obligation, for pre-65 employees, was 7.5% in 1997       
decreasing linearly each successive year until it reaches 5.5% in 1999, after   
which it remains constant.                                                      

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts   
reported for the health care plans. A 1% change in health care trend rates would
have the following effects:

The Company's employees and agents also participate in defined contribution     
plans that cover substantially all full-time employees and agents. Company      
contributions were $852 in 1998, $868 in 1997 and $800 in 1996.

AMERITAS LIFE INSURANCE CORP. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996 -- (CONTINUED) 
(IN THOUSANDS)
5. INSURANCE REGULATORY MATTERS                                                 
STATUTORY SURPLUS AND NET INCOME                                                

Net income of Ameritas and its insurance subsidiaries, as determined in         
accordance with statutory accounting practices, was $41,019, $47,200, and       
$44,100 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively and statutory surplus was         
$357,700, $311,300, and $257,300 at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,           
respectively. Insurance companies are required to maintain a certain level of   
surplus to be in compliance with state laws and regulations. Surplus is         
monitored by state regulators to ensure compliance with risk based capital      
requirements.                                                                   

Under statutes of the Insurance Department of Nebraska, the amount of dividends 
payable to stockholders are limited.                                            

6. REINSURANCE                                                                  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company assumes and cedes reinsurance   
with other insurers and reinsurers. These arrangements provide greater          
diversification of business and limit the maximum net loss potential on large   
risks.                                                                          

The effect of reinsurance on premiums earned is as follows:

The Company remains contingently liable in the event that a reinsurer is unable 
to meet the obligations ceded under the reinsurance agreement.                  

7. RESERVE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996 -- (CONTINUED) 
(IN THOUSANDS)
7. RESERVE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS -- (CONTINUED)                                     

The liability for unpaid accident and health claims and claim adjustment        
expenses is included in policy and contract claims on the consolidated balance  
sheets.                                                                         

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES                                                
INVESTMENTS                                                                     

Securities commitments of $30,545 and $25,848, and mortgage loan and real estate
commitments of $8,284 and $17,742 were outstanding for investments to be        
purchased in subsequent years as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.   
These commitments have been made in the normal course of investment operations  
and are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. The Company's   
exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual notional amount of    
those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies and collateral     
requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for   
on-balance sheet instruments.                                                   

LINE OF CREDIT                                                                  
The Company has a $25,000 unsecured line of credit available at December 31,
1998. No balance was outstanding at any time during 1998 or 1997.               

STATE LIFE AND HEALTH GUARANTY FUNDS                                            

As a condition of doing business, all states and jurisdictions have adopted laws
requiring membership in life and health insurance guaranty funds. Member        
companies are subject to assessments each year based on life, health or annuity 
premiums collected in the state. In some states these assessments may be applied
against premium taxes. The Company has estimated its costs related to past      
insolvencies and has provided a reserve included in other liabilities of $2,650 
and $2,325 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.                      

LITIGATION                                                                      

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries is subject to litigation in 
the normal course of business. Management does not believe that the Company is  
party to any such pending litigation which would have a material adverse effect 
on its financial statements or future operations.                               

9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                          

The following disclosures are made regarding fair value information about       
certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that      
value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are   
based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those     
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the    
discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived   
fair value estimates, in many cases, could not be realized on immediate         
settlement of the instrument. All nonfinancial instruments are excluded from    
disclosure requirements.                                                        

Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the    
underlying value of the Company.                                                

The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information    
available to management as of December 31, 1998 and 1997. Although management is
not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair     
value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes 
of these financial statements since that date; therefore, current estimates of  
fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996 -- (CONTINUED) 
(IN THOUSANDS)
9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- (CONTINUED)                           

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for each class of financial instrument for which it is   
practicable to estimate a value:                                                

     FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES -- For publicly traded securities, fair
 value is determined using an independent pricing source. For securities
   without a readily ascertainable fair value, the value has been determined
   using an interest rate spread matrix based upon quality, weighted average
maturity and Treasury yields.                                         

      EQUITY SECURITIES -- For publicly traded securities, fair value is
determined using prices from an independent pricing source.           

    LOANS ON INSURANCE POLICIES -- Fair value for loans on insurance
 policies is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at interest
     rates currently offered for similar loans. Loans on insurance policies with
  similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations.

        MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE -- Mortgage loans in good standing are
valued on the basis of discounted cash flow. The interest rate that is
assumed is based upon the weighted average term of the mortgage and   
appropriate spread over Treasuries.                                   

       OTHER INVESTMENTS -- Fair value for venture capital partnerships is
estimated based on values as last reported by the partnership and     
  discounted for their lack of marketability. Real estate partnerships are
carried on the equity method and are excluded from the fair value     
disclosure.                                                           

         SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS -- The carrying amount approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments.                   

       CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- The carrying amounts equal fair value.

ACCRUED INVESTMENT INCOME -- Fair value equals book value.  

         ACCUMULATED CONTRACT VALUES -- Funds on deposit with a fixed maturity
   are valued at discounted present value using market interest rates. Funds
 on deposit which do not have fixed maturities are carried at the amount
 payable on demand at the reporting date, which approximates fair value.

       COMMITMENTS -- The estimated fair value of commitments approximates
  carrying value because the fees currently charged for these arrangements
and the underlying interest rates approximate market.

In September, 1998, Ameritas and Acacia Life Insurance Company (Acacia) agreed  
in principle that all of Acacia Financial Group, Ltd.'s (the stock holding      
company of Acacia) outstanding common stock, would be acquired by Ameritas      
Holding Company in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of         
interests. This merger became effective January 1, 1999. In addition the members
interest in Acacia Mutual Holding Corporation were merged with those of Ameritas
Mutual Insurance Holding Company. Concurrently, the name was changed to Ameritas
Acacia Mutual Holding Company. Historical financial information presented in    
future reports will be restated to included the financial information of the    
merged companies.                                                               

The following summarized unaudited data gives effect to the acquisition as if   
the combination had been consummated. The most current combined financial       
information available is as of September 30, 1998.

APPENDIX A 
ILLUSTRATIONS OF DEATH BENEFITS AND ACCUMULATION VALUES                         

The following  tables  illustrate  how the Net Cash  Surrender  Values and Death
Benefits of a Policy may change with the investment  experience of the Fund. The
tables  show how the Net Cash  Surrender  Values and Death  Benefits of a Policy
issued  to  an  Insured  of  a  given  age  and  specified   underwriting   risk
classification  who pays the given  premium at issue would vary over time if the
investment  return on the  assets  held in each  portfolio  of the Funds  were a
uniform, gross, after-tax annual rate of 0%, 6%, or 12%. The tables on pages A-2
through A-5 illustrate a Policy issued to a male, age 45, under a Preferred rate
non-smoker underwriting risk classification. This policy provides for a standard
smoker and non-smoker,  and preferred  non-smoker  classification  and different
rates for certain  Specified  Amounts.  The Net Cash Surrender  Values and Death
Benefits  would be  different  from those shown if the gross  annual  investment
rates of return averaged 0%, 6%, and 12% over a period of years,  but fluctuated
above and below those  averages for individual  Policy Years,  or if the Insured
were assigned to a different underwriting risk classification.                  

The second column of the tables shows the accumulated value of the premiums paid
at 5%. The following  columns show the Net Cash  Surrender  Values and the Death
Benefits for uniform  hypothetical  rates of return shown in these  tables.  The
tables on pages A-3 and A-4 are based on the current  Cost of  Insurance  Rates,
current  expense  deductions  and the current  percent of premium  loads.  These
reflect the basis on which Ameritas  currently  sells its Policies.  The maximum
Cost of  Insurance  Rates  allowable  under the  Policy  are based upon the 1980
Commissioner's  Standard  Ordinary  Smoker  and  Non-Smoker,   Male  and  Female
Mortality Tables.  Ameritas anticipates reflecting future improvements in actual
mortality  experience through adjustments in the current Cost of Insurance Rates
actually applied.  Ameritas also anticipates  reflecting any future improvements
in expenses  incurred by applying  lower  percent of premiums of loads and other
expense  deductions.  The Death  Benefits and cash values shown in the tables on
pages A-3 and A-5 are based on the assumption that the maximum allowable Cost of
Insurance Rates as described  above  ("guaranteed  cost") and maximum  allowable
expense deductions are made throughout the life of the Policy.                  

The amounts shown for the Net Cash Surrender  Values and Death Benefits  reflect
the fact that the net  investment  return of the  Subaccounts  is lower than the
gross,  after-tax return of the assets held in the Funds as a result of expenses
paid by the Fund and charges  levied against the  Subaccounts.  The values shown
take into  account  an  average  of the daily  expenses  paid by each  portfolio
available  for  investment  (the  equivalent  to an annual  rate of 1.50% of the
aggregate  average  daily net  assets  of the  Fund),  and the  daily  charge by
Ameritas to each  Subaccount for assuming  mortality and expense risks (which is
equivalent  to a charge at an annual  rate of 0.60% for Policy  Years 1 - 15 and
.30% thereafter on pages A-2 and A-4 and at an annual rate of .60% for all years
on pages  A-3 and A-5 of the  average  net  assets of the  Subaccounts).  Berger
Associates has voluntarily  agreed to waive its advisory fee and has voluntarily
reimbursed the Funds for additional expenses to the extent that normal operating
expenses  in any  fiscal  year,  including  the  management  fee  but  excluding
brokerage  commissions,  interest,  taxes and extraordinary  expenses, of Berger
IPT-100 Fund exceed 1.00%, and the normal operating  expenses in any fiscal year
of the Berger  IPT-Small  Company  Growth Fund exceed 1.15%,  of the  respective
Fund's  average daily net assets.  NBMI has agreed to reimburse  each  Neuberger
Berman  Portfolio  for its  operating  expenses  and its pro  rata  share of its
corresponding  series' operating  expenses,  excluding the compensation of NBMI,
taxes, interest,  extraordinary expenses, brokerage commissions, and transaction
costs that exceed 1% of the  portfolio's  average  daily net asset value.  These
agreements are expected to continue in future years but may be terminated at any
time. The illustrated gross annual investment rates of return of 0%, 6%, and 12%
were computed after  deducting  these amounts and correspond to approximate  net
annual  rates of  -2.10%,  3.90%,  and 9.90% for years 1-15 and  -1.80%,  4.20%,
10.20%   thereafter  on  pages  A-2  and  A-4  and  -2.10%,   3.90%,  and  9.90%
respectively, on pages A-3 and A-5.                                             

The  hypothetical  values  shown in the  tables do not  reflect  any  additional
charges for federal  income tax burden  attributable  to Separate  Account LLVL,
since Ameritas is not currently making such charges.  However,  such charges may
be made in the future and, in that event,  the gross annual  investment  rate of
return  would  have to exceed 0 percent,  6 percent,  or 12 percent by an amount
sufficient  to cover the tax charges in order to produce the Death  Benefits and
values illustrated. (See the section on Federal Tax Matters.)                   

The  tables  illustrate  the Policy  values  that  would  result  based upon the
hypothetical  investment  rates of return if premiums are paid as indicated,  if
all net premiums are allocated to Separate  Account LLVL, and if no Policy loans
have been made.  The tables  are also based on the  assumptions  that the Policy
Owner has not requested an increase or decrease in the initial Specified Amount,
that no  Partial  Withdrawals  have been  made,  and that no more  than  fifteen
transfers  have been made in any Policy  Year so that no transfer  charges  have
been  incurred.  Illustrated  values would be different if the proposed  Insured
were female, a smoker, in substandard risk classification,  or were another age,
or if a higher or lower premium was illustrated.                                

Upon  request,  AVLIC  will  provide  comparable  illustrations  based  upon the
proposed  Insured's  age, sex and  underwriting  classification,  the  Specified
Amount,  the  Death  Benefit  option,  and  Planned  Periodic  Premium  schedule
requested, and any available riders requested. In addition, upon client request,
illustrations  may be furnished  reflecting  allocation of premiums to specified
Subaccounts.  Such  illustrations  will reflect the expenses of the portfolio in
which the Subaccount invests.

Insofar as  indemnification  for liability  arising under the  Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to directors,  officers,  and  controlling  persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such  indemnification  is against  public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore,  unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities  (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director,  officer or  controlling  person of the registrant in the
successful  defense of any  action,  suit or  proceeding)  is  asserted  by such
director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been  settled by  controlling  precedent,  submit to a court of  appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such  indemnification  by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.                                                                     

 REPRESENTATION PURSUANT TO RULE 6e-3(T)

This  filing is made  pursuant to Rules 6c-3 and  6e-3(T)  under the  Investment
Company Act of 1940.

Investment Company Act of 1940 - Section 8 and 11
Securities Act of 1933 - Section 5 and Rule 145
Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.
April 5, 2007



RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF
INSURANCE PRODUCTS
	DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT


Ameritas Life Insurance Corp., et al.



Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated April 2, 2007 and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. ("ALIC"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company ("AVLIC") under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if AVLIC transfers its Separate Account V, Separate Account VA-2, Separate Account VA and Separate Account VL (the "Separate Accounts") to ALIC by operation of law in connection with the proposed merger of AVLIC into ALIC (the "Merger"). In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if: (1) the change in depositor of the Separate Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected though the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Separate Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act are filed by ALIC and the Separate Accounts to cover any securities issued after the Merger in connection with the variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts funded by the Separate Accounts.
You have not requested, and we are not providing, any assurance with respect to reliance by the Separate Accounts, AVLIC or ALIC on any prior staff no-action positions. In addition, you have not requested, and we are not providing, any assurance with respect to reliance by the Separate Accounts or ALIC after the Merger on any prior exemptive relief obtained by AVLIC or the Separate Accounts prior to the Merger.
Because our position is based on facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the issues presented.

Sally Samuel
Senior Counsel

Applicants' Representations
1. The Life Insurance Companies, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective separate accounts, propose to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolio for shares of the Current Portfolio held by the Accounts to fund the Contracts.
2. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. is the depositor and sponsor of the Ameritas Life Accounts. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York is the depositor and sponsor of the Ameritas Life of NY Accounts. The Union Central Life Insurance Company is the depositor and sponsor of the Carillon Life Account.
3. Each Account is a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act, and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust. Security interests under the Contracts have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). The application sets forth the registration statement file numbers for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts.
4. Each Account is divided into subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding investment portfolio (a “Portfolio”) of a series-type management investment company, including CVSI.
5. Pursuant to the Contracts, the Life Insurance Companies reserve the right to substitute shares of one Portfolio for shares of another. The prospectuses for the Contracts also disclose that the Life Insurance Companies reserve this right.
6. CVSI is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-03591) that currently consists of six investment portfolios, including the Current Portfolio, and issues a separate series of shares in connection with each. CVSI has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 002-80154).
7. Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (“CIM”) serves as the investment adviser to each CVSI Portfolio. CIM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AMHC.
8. The VIPFV is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-05361) that currently consists of 32 investment portfolios, one of which, the Replacement Portfolio, is the subject of the proposed Substitution. VIPFV issues a separate series of shares in connection with each Portfolio and has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 033-17704).
9. Fidelity Management & Research Company (“FMR”) serves as the manager of each Portfolio of VIPFV. FMR receives an investment management fee from each Portfolio. Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (“FIMM”) and other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio. FIMM has the day-to-day responsibility of choosing investments for the Replacement Portfolio. In addition, other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio and may provide investment research and advice for the Replacement Portfolio. None of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM, or other affiliates of FMR are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated person) of any of the Applicants. Likewise, none of the Applicants are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated persons) of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM or other affiliates of FMR.
10. The Applicants state that Replacement Portfolio's and Current Portfolio's respective investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same. A comparison of the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Replacement Portfolio and the Current Portfolio is included in the application.
11. The following table compares the fees and expenses of the Current Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio as of the year ended December 31, 2012:
 Current portfolioReplacement portfolioCalvert Variable Series, Inc., Calvert VP Money Market PortfolioVariable Insurance Products Fund V, VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial ClassManagement Fee0.25%0.17%.Distribution and Service (12b-1) FeeNoneNone.Other Expenses0.14%0.09%.Total Operating Expenses0.39%0.26%.Fee Waivers and Expense ReimbursementsNone 1None.Net Operating Expenses0.39% 20.26%.1 The Investment Advisor, CIM, has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through April 30, 2014 to 0.40%. Under the terms of the contractual expense limitation, operating expenses do not include interest expense, brokerage commissions, taxes and extraordinary expenses. Only the Board of Directors of CVSI may terminate a Portfolio's expense cap before the contractual period expires.2 The Advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of $88,900 or 0.11%, for Net Operating Expenses of 0.28% to maintain a positive yield during the year ended December 31, 2012.
12. The Applicants state that the proposed Substitution is in response to a decision by the Board of Directors for CVSI, at a meeting held on June 5, 2013, to approve the dissolution of the Current Portfolio on or about November 15, 2013 (the “Liquidation Date”). The board's decision to liquidate the Current Portfolio requires the Life Insurance Companies to transfer accumulated Contract value invested in the Current Portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the Contracts on or before the Liquidation Date. Currently, the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the Contracts is the Current Portfolio. Accordingly, the proposed Substitution is necessary in order to provide the Contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option. Consequently, the Life Insurance Companies have determined to replace the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio via the Substitution.
13. The Life Insurance Companies submit that the Replacement Portfolio is an appropriate alternative for Contract owners for several reasons. First, its investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the Current Portfolio. Second, it is substantially larger than the Current Portfolio, has had lower overall expense levels than the Portfolio in recent years, and has had higher yields in recent years than the Current Portfolio. Third, the Contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the Life Insurance Companies currently offer one or more VIPFV portfolios (other than the Replacement Portfolio).
14. The Applicants believe that Contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the Replacement Portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the Replacement Portfolio, as contrasted Start Printed Page 65395with the size and recent yields of the Current Portfolio. The yield for the Current Portfolio for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.01%. The net asset value of the Current Portfolio was $85,913,000 as of December 31, 2012. The yield for the Replacement Portfolio Initial Class shares for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.08%. The net asset value of the Replacement Portfolio supporting Initial Class shares was $889,797,000 as of December 31, 2012.
15. The Applicants believe that Contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the Replacement Portfolio as compared to the Current Portfolio. Specifically, the management fee, other expenses, and total operating expenses are less than those of the Current Portfolio. Both Portfolios have no charge for Rule 12b-1 distribution and services fees. The total annual operating expense of the Replacement Portfolio is less than that of the Current Portfolio. Given this decrease, the Applicants believe that the Substitution would benefit Contract owners by reducing the overall level of Portfolio expenses.
Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitution. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust.
2. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution is not the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Section 26(c) was intended to provide for Commission scrutiny of a proposed Substitution which could, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both, as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption. Consequently, the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holder's only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security, or to elect a costly and, in effect, forced redemption.
3. Applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide Contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include Section 26(c).
4. Applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. All redemptions of shares of the Current Portfolio and purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolio will be effected in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The Substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the Substitution (“Effective Date”) with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable Account.
5. Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio will be transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge. Contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the Life Insurance Companies' respective obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way and the Substitution will not change Contract owners' insurance benefits under the Contracts. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitution, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage commissions, will be paid by the Life Insurance Companies. In addition, the Substitution will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners.
6. The Applicants also represent that the Substitution will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Life Insurance Companies will not exercise any right they may have under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the Contracts for the period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date.
7. Existing Contract owners will be notified of the proposed Substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the Contracts (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) at least thirty (30) days before the Effective Date. New purchasers of the Contracts will be provided the Pre-Substitution Notice, the Contract prospectus, and the prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
8. The Pre-Substitution Notice will: (i) State that the Applicants filed the application seeking approval of the Substitution; (ii) set forth the anticipated Effective Date; (iii) explain that the Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio would be attributable to the Replacement Portfolio as of the Effective Date; (iv) state that, from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice until the Effective Date, Contract Owners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Current Portfolio sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contract; (v) advise Contract owners that any contract value remaining in the Current Portfolio sub-account on the Effective Date will be transferred to a sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio, and that the Substitution will take place at relative net asset value; (vi) inform Contract owners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the applicable Life Insurance Company will permit Contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio to any other available sub-accounts offered under their Contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees, if any, that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contracts; and (vii) inform Contract owners that, except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus, the applicable Life Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio for at least thirty (30) days after the Effective Date.
9. All Contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio prior to the Substitution. In addition, within five (5) days following the Substitution, Contract owners affected by the Substitution will be notified in writing that the Substitution was carried out. This notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice, and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio were transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge Start Printed Page 65396(including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge.
10. The Applicants represent that the Life Insurance Companies will not receive, for three (3) years after the Effective Date, any direct or indirect benefits from the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), in connection with assets attributable to the Contracts affected by the Substitution, at a higher rate than the Life Insurance Companies had received from the Current Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), including without limitation 12b-1 fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements. The Applicants further represent that the Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a Life Insurance Company or its affiliates by the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter, or their affiliates.
11. Applicants submit that the replacement of the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio is consistent with the protection of Contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act and, thus, meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution meets the standards that the Commission and its staff have applied to Substitutions that have been approved in the past.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application, the Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and should therefore be granted.
Start Signature
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

Deputy Secretary.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Healthplans.com is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Healthplans.com. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of Los Angeles, California, but may proceed telephonically if the claimant so chooses.
The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights.

BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration you must email us at legal@healthplans.com. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!
