William J. Conaty Elected to Goodyear Board









August 1, 2011










AKRON, Ohio, August 1, 2011 – William J. Conaty, retired senior vice president of human resources for the General Electric Company, has been elected to the Board of Directors of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.
“Bill Conaty is one of the most highly respected people in his field and is a true business leader,” said Goodyear Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Kramer.  “Bill’s experience in coaching and developing leaders and teams will be a tremendous asset to both our board of directors and our company.” 
Conaty served as GE’s chief human resources officer from 1993 to 2007.  He joined GE in 1967 and in his 40-year career, moved through a progression of leadership roles in the company’s transportation, aerospace and aircraft engines businesses.
Following his retirement from GE, he formed Conaty Consulting LLC and joined Clayton, Dubilier & Rice as an advisory operating partner.  Other clients have included The Procter & Gamble Company, Dell Inc. and The Boeing Company.  He is the co-author with business advisor Ram Charan of The Talent Masters: Why Smart Leaders Put People Before Numbers, which was published in 2010.
Conaty, 65, holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island where he currently is a trustee of the university.  He served as Chairman of both the National Academy of Human Resources and the HR Policy Association from 2001-2007 and continues to serve on the advisory board of Cornell University’s Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies.  Conaty is also currently on the Board of Trustees at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital in Lebanon, New Hampshire. 
The election of Conaty brings the size of Goodyear’s board to 13 members.
Goodyear is one of the world’s largest tire companies.  It employs approximately 73,000 people and manufactures its products in 54 facilities in 22 countries around the world.  Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry.  For more information about Goodyear and its products, go to www.goodyear.com.

AKRON, Ohio, Aug. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- William J. Conaty, retired senior vice president of human resources for the General Electric Company, has been elected to the Board of Directors of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NYSE:   GT). 
(Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20050204/GTLOGO )
"Bill Conaty is one of the most highly respected people in his field and is a true business leader," said Goodyear Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Kramer.  "Bill's experience in coaching and developing leaders and teams will be a tremendous asset to both our board of directors and our company."  
Conaty served as GE's chief human resources officer from 1993 to 2007.  He joined GE in 1967 and in his 40-year career, moved through a progression of leadership roles in the company's transportation, aerospace and aircraft engines businesses.
Following his retirement from GE, he formed Conaty Consulting LLC and joined Clayton, Dubilier & Rice as an advisory operating partner.  Other clients have included The Procter & Gamble Company, Dell Inc. and The Boeing Company.  He is the co-author with business advisor Ram Charan of The Talent Masters: Why Smart Leaders Put People Before Numbers, which was published in 2010.
Conaty, 65, holds a bachelor's degree in business administration from Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island where he currently is a trustee of the university.  He served as Chairman of both the National Academy of Human Resources and the HR Policy Association from 2001-2007 and continues to serve on the advisory board of Cornell University's Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies.  Conaty is also currently on the Board of Trustees at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital in Lebanon, New Hampshire.  
The election of Conaty brings the size of Goodyear's board to 13 members. 
Goodyear is one of the world's largest tire companies.  It employs approximately 73,000 people and manufactures its products in 54 facilities in 22 countries around the world.  Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry.  For more information about Goodyear and its products, go to www.goodyear.com.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
