Designer Lamp Styles and Decorating Tips

Find designer brands, such as Uttermost, Possini Euro Design, George Kovacs and Robert Abbey. Favored by top interior designers, these brands offer fresh designs and excitement, often through the innovative use of materials, shade, base and finial combinations.
                
                We are known for the range of styles we offer. From Tiffany styles to contemporary designs, country cottage looks and more, you're sure to discover fresh inspiration and new ideas to complement your existing interior.
                
                Quick Shopping Tips: 
                
Redecorating a living room or seating area? Achieve a more natural look with odd-number groupings. Instead of using only two table lamps in a room, add a floor or swing arm lamp to balance the look.
Office or a study area? Try adjustable or gooseneck designs that brighten and offer flexibility for reading and working.
Need design inspiration? Browse our room ideas photo gallery for a variety of interior design styles and suggestions on how to coordinate a new lamp with each look.

                Browse and enjoy! For questions about any of our lamps, just give us a call. One of our American Lighting Association trained experts will be happy to offer advice and suggestions.
