2 Apple Inc. Product Launches to Look Forward to in 2017
This Fool is excited about these two Apple products -- and the potential they have to boost Apple's financial results and ecosystem. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Jun 26, 2017 at 10:30AM
            
            





The first half of 2017 has been quite a busy one for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of new product launches. The company has updated several of its Mac personal computers, released new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models with a host of interesting new features, and previewed a lot of the software goodness that's coming to Apple's major platforms.
As exciting as the first half of 2017 has been for the Mac maker, I think the second half of this year should be even more exciting.

New iPhones! This year promises to be one of the biggest years for Apple's iPhone yet. The company is reportedly planning to release a high-end/premium iPhone, commonly referred to as the iPhone 8, which sounds like it should be quite the show-stopper.
This new iPhone is expected to come with an all-new, full-face OLED display, which should dramatically increase image quality and deliver a substantially better user experience. It's also expected to come with 3D sensing capabilities that some believe will be critical to enabling new augmented-reality use cases. Of course, I'm sure that Apple will update much, if not all, of the internals to deliver higher performance and better device efficiency.
The iPhone 8 just sounds like it's going to be a cool product that has the very real potential to spark an iPhone "super cycle" and boost the iPhone's average selling prices.





Additionally, Apple is expected to launch two "standard" iPhone models, commonly referred to as the iPhone 7s/7s Plus because they're said to be relatively straightforward upgrades to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones.
These, admittedly, aren't anywhere near as exciting as the new iPhone 8 promises to be, but they should bring solid new features with more affordable price points compared to what the iPhone 8 is likely to cost. And that's always a good thing.
The iMac Pro Apple announced its new iMac Pro personal computers at WWDC, but they won't be available for sale until the end of the year. Although the wait may certainly be frustrating for pro-users looking to stick with Apple, the company does seem to have a compelling product with the iMac Pro.
The new iMac Pro systems should include extremely fast, high-core count processors, a powerful graphics processor, a great display, and other goodies. For content creators, developers, and other potential users for whom time is equal to money, having access to extremely powerful macOS-powered devices should be rather nice.





Once Apple begins selling these systems, which I suspect will do far better in the marketplace than the Mac Pro has, I'd expect a noticeable boost in the Mac's average selling prices -- and therefore revenue (all else being equal, of course).
The iMac Pro isn't going to be a financially significant boost for Apple (though boosts to any of Apple's businesses should be welcomed by stockholders), but it'll certainly help entice "pro" users to stick with, or perhaps even migrate to, Apple's Mac platform -- a long-term positive for the platform and, ultimately, for Apple.

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






It has been suggested that this article be merged into Timeline of Apple Inc. products. (Discuss) Proposed since May 2015.


The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 3, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.[1]
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA and Turkey (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two-year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.[2]
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).[3]

Apple Inc.’s Best Product in 2016
Apple's large-screen iPhone steals the show this year. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Nov 4, 2016 at 8:30AM
            
            





Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's largest companies in terms of revenue and profit generation. Perhaps the most impressive part of the company's financial success is that it delivers those impressive results with a tight, highly-focused portfolio of products.
This focus pays off for the consumer-electronics giant, as its products are arguably best in class. That's why it's sometimes a bit difficult to pick a "best" product among those that the company launches each year.
Nevertheless, this year, it's quite clear that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus stole the show. 
Apple nails it with the jumbo iPhone
In 2014, Apple began a trend of releasing not just one but two new flagship iPhone models each year -- one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch display.

The iPhone 7 Plus in jet black is one great device. Image source: Apple. 





The smaller and larger models were, during the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s generations, differentiated by screen size, screen resolution, pixel density, and minor camera features.
With the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple delivered a greater degree of differentiation relative to its smaller counterpart than it had in prior iPhone cycles. The iPhone 7 Plus incorporates a dual-lens camera that enables some interesting and useful features, such as 2X optical zoom and a nifty depth-of-field effect, which you can see in this picture that I took:

Image source: author.
The result is that Apple's more expensive, jumbo-sized iPhone is selling better than what Apple had expected going into the device launch -- something that could have positive implications on iPhone average selling prices and ultimately revenue, should Apple be able to catch up with demand in a timely fashion.





The iPhone 7 Plus truly represents the best of Apple: a well-crafted product with unique features that entice customers to pay more because they're genuinely getting more. Should Apple be able to continue to deliver differentiated, meaningful features with future, premium-priced iPhones in coming generations, Apple's iPhone business could benefit greatly.
Runner-up? The new MacBook Pro computers
Although the internet seems to be divided on Apple's newly announced MacBook Pro updates, I view these systems as quite innovative and unquestionably worthy of "runner-up" status here. 

Image source: Apple. 
The new MacBook Pro computers include numerous internal upgrades -- par for the course in the world of personal computers -- along with a significantly enhanced display, a reworked Force Touch trackpad, a new keyboard design, and a nifty-looking Touch Bar.





Apple seems to have made a genuine effort to deliver something unique to what's arguably a boring product category, and for that the company should be applauded. But it's too soon to tell how well these new MacBook Pro systems will do in the marketplace. Apple has been losing market share in personal computers, and these new systems are the company's best chance of regaining that share. Early indications look good: The shipping times for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and new 15-inch MacBook Pro are now in the four- to five-week range -- up from the two- to three-week range they started at.
These long shipping times may simply be indicative of poor supply, but I'm not willing to buy that explanation yet.

First published on Thursday 6 October 2011 06.56 EDT






Apple II
Handbuilt by Steve Wozniak – the bearded sidekick to Steve Jobs – the Apple II was released in 1977, just 12 months after the very first Apple computer, the Apple I. Unlike that Apple I, which was assembled in Jobs's parents' garage, the Apple II signalled the Apple co-founder's early drive. Some years later, he was reported as saying: "My dream for the Apple II was to sell the first real packed computer." The Apple II duly became the fastest-selling personal computer of its time, fetching $79m in sales in 1979.
The first Macintosh

The Macintosh 128K was released in January 1984 "with all the showbiz of a car launch". And what a launch it was. No technology company would have dared dream about flaunting a personal computer in a multimillion-dollar Superbowl slot, but Apple did. The Macintosh 128J was different thought – it wasn't especially for business or bespectacled engineers; it was comparatively easy to use.
The iMac
Three years after his return to Apple in 1998, Jobs urged the world to "think different". But no one anticipated the iMac, the computer that kickstarted Apple's fortunes and propelled the company to where it is today. As the Guardian review from 14 May 1998 noted: "nobody who attended last week's product launch expected to find the most radical Macintosh since the original hit the streets 14 years ago … There isn't even a floppy drive."
The iPod

Unveiled a decade ago this month, the iPod is the one device that transformed Apple from a computer company into a mass-market electronics giant – and would later spark a revolution in digital music. Though many who bought it had to hack their computers to store music on it, the first-generation iPod was a stylish MP3 player boasting a 10-hour battery life and space for 1,000 songs. "Listening to music will never be the same again," said Jobs at its launch in October 2001.
The iPod nano
Steve Jobs discontinued the iPod mini at the height of its popularity in September 2005. His indefatigable drive for design and efficiency saw it replaced with the much smaller nano. Apple reinvented the nano in September 2010 with its sixth iteration. At 21.1g the new nano was 15g lighter than its predecessor and half the height.
The iPhone





 


  Facebook 
 


  Twitter 
 


  Pinterest 


Less than half a decade after the iPod, Apple was already the biggest name in digital music. After months of rumour and anticipation, Jobs, in January 2007, unveiled what would quickly become Apple's killer product. The phone was a hit with techies and non-techies alike. A typically fervent Stephen Fry reviewed the iPhone four months after its launch. "Beauty. Charm. Delight. Excitement. Ooh. Aah. Wow! Let me at it," he wrote in the Guardian. With the fifth incarnation unveiled earlier this week, the excitement has not yet dissipated.
iTunes
Until Jobs unveiled iTunes in January 2001, no one had been able to convince music label executives that people might pay for songs online. Announced at the back end of a 90-minute keynote to launch the new Macintosh, iTunes was an unexciting "all-in-one digital music program" that brought together MP3 playback, internet radio and CD writing. This week Apple began letting people access their digital music across any of their devices wirelessly. It is the beginning of Apple's cloud revolution.
The iPad
Apple's so-called "Jesus tablet" was everything that everyone didn't need on its launch in January 2010. Less than a year later, Apple had invented a new market and intentionally spawned hundreds of poor-man copycats. Dubbed "the oversized iPhone" with a 9.7in screen, Apple's lean-back device would be the saviour of the media industry. Research group Gartner last month forecast that tablet computers will see an explosion in sales over the next four years, selling 60% as many units as PCs by 2015 – and Apple's iPad will still have almost half the market by then.
iOS App Store
Apple announced a new milestone for its App Store in July this year: 15bn downloads (of more than 500,000 apps) since it launched in July 2008. The App Store has become the cornerstone to the iPhone's success, with the world's media giants all scrambling for a prominent place on the smartphone of choice – and spawning a new market for software developers. Pundits called it the future of mobile consumption, and Apple has since expanded its App Store to OS X computers, potentially ushering in a new age of software development.
One more thing: Apple stores
Apple opened its first retail store on 19 May 2001, in Glendale, California. As of July this year, Apple had opened more than 350 stores worldwide, with the largest in London's Covent Garden. Most thought Apple's move into physical retail space was madness – but they did not foresee that the philosophy, design and layout of the stores would encapsulate what drives Jobs. Customers have since flocked to the Genius Bar.

Apple: 'Single Product Company'... It's Not The iPhone - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Apple: 'Single Product Company'... It's Not The iPhoneJun.15.17 | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Save Money Retire Early Long only, long-term horizon, CFASummarySomeday, the iPhone will be disrupted by an even better user interface. We are still long Apple despite this expectation.Services is targeted to double in the next four years. But even longer term, we believe it will be more important to Apple than the iPhone.The services ecosystem is the "single product." The iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch, TV, and HomePods are accessories. Hardware is a means of accessing the real product.We believe Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a "single product company," but that product is not the iPhone. Someday, the iPhone will likely get disrupted by a new user interface, probably related to augmented reality (AR). But we don't think this will impact Apple as much as some might expect because the iPhone is not the true product people are buying. We see the services ecosystem functioning as the single product. All the hardware, including the iPhone, are accessories that give access to the ecosystem. The ecosystem of services is much harder to disrupt. It is made of so many components, developers, and partners. It provides so much utility for so many people. Even if the way we access it changes, the ecosystem will continue to provide an incredible experience. But coming back to the current reality of iPads and iPhones to access the ecosystem. We see iPhone demand remaining flattish over the next couple of quarters, and then seeing a catch-up period when the next iPhone launches. And we expect iPad demand to bottom in 2017 with a five-year refresh cycle starting in 2018, as the 2013 iPad Air becomes a legacy piece of hardware. A Single Product Company It has come to our attention that Apple is viewed by some as a "single product company." We believe Apple CEO Tim Cook sees that opinion becoming more widespread, coaxing him to make comments like: "Our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services." - CEO Tim Cook 2Q17 Earnings Call
 And "Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company." - CEO Tim Cook 2Q17 Earnings Call Services Nearly A Fortune 100 Company In the last 12 months, Services has generated revenue of $26.5 billion after eight years of growing at 20% CAGR. Services include digital content and services (iTunes, App Store, iBooks, Apple Music), AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Currently, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) bookends the Fortune 100 list with $27.5 billion in revenue. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) at 106 is close to the same revenue as Apple Services. While notable companies not far away are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at 98 and Nike (NYSE:NKE) at 88. In the 2Q17 earnings calls, CFO Luca Maestri reiterated: "Our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020." If Apple can achieve this goal, it could eclipse Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in revenue, assuming Coca-Cola stands still for four years (-5.5% y/y in 2016) Other Apple Hardware A Fortune 500 Company Apple's Other Products generated revenue of $11.5 billion in the last 12 months. It has stayed in this range for a number of years as products come in and out of fashion (i.e. iPod, Apple Watch, Apple TV). This includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) closes out the Fortune 500 list with $5.145 billion in revenue. Apple's Other Products at $11.5 billion would be closer to the Fortune 250. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) at 248 is close to the same revenue as Apple's Other Products. Other notable companies nearby include Estee Lauder at 253 and Toys "R" Us at 244. iPhone Is Not "The Single Product"… iPhone ranks in the top 12 on Fortune as a standalone product, just ahead of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And iPhone made up 63% of Apple's revenue in 2016.
 We get it. Many people see iPhone as the product Apple will succeed by or fail because of. And we don't disagree. But hear us out. …The Ecosystem Is "The Single Product" As important as the iPhone is to Apple, the iPhone is just a popular accessory. Arguably, something will disrupt the smartphone someday. People will instead use something else to access the Apple ecosystem, perhaps an augmented reality user interface. 

 Source: Minority Report How much time would you spend with your iPhone if you had no Wi-Fi, no data connectivity, and no apps? Now think about all the great synergies you get when you have your iPhone synced with your Mac, your iPad, your Apple Watch, your Apple TV, your Apple CarPlay and soon your Apple HomePod. All these pieces of hardware are simply accessories to connect you to the ecosystem of functionality. The ecosystem is what improves your life, and the ecosystem is what makes Apple's hardware products so great. Hardware is an enabler. No doubt, the ecosystem became what it is today because of hardware, like the iPhone, but the focus has changed. Apple gives you the choice of how you want to interact with the ecosystem. While we have seen people with iPads on the street taking photos. The result has so far been that most people choose an iPhone. 

 Source: ExtremeTech Since 2010, over 1.1 billion iPhones have been sold with 215 million or 20% of those sold in the last 12 months. iPad has not fared as well. Since 2010, Apple has sold about 360 million iPads. The gap in the number of units sold is interesting even despite the iPad selling at 70-80% of the price of the iPhone.
 Many would say the upgrade cycle for consumers is longer, but why is it longer? Our iPad Story At home, we have one iPad. It's an iPad Air from 2013. It has been nearly four years since we bought it. We use it mostly to browse the web, play Candy Crush (we're on level 1268), but by far we watch YouTube on it the most. We used to use it for FaceTime, but the quality of the camera is no longer comparable to our newer iPhones, so we are willing to give up size for quality. We only use the iPad a couple of hours a day, so the battery is more than sufficient. The iPad never leaves our flat, so running out of power is never an issue. Doing a double take of our iPad story, we understand that everyone doesn't use their iPad the same way as us. But one thing in common is the battery life. Even if you take your four-year-old iPad out with you all day, you will probably come home with enough power to watch a cooking video for dinner. Our iPhone Story An iPhone is a completely different story. I have had two iPhones in the last 4.5 years; my current setup is an iPhone 6s in space gray, which I got at the end of 2015 in the batch that had the battery issues. As a result, I have a "new" battery in my almost 1.5-year-old iPhone, but my next refresh could be longer than average because of the battery change. My first smartphone and first iPhone was the iPhone 5, which I got in late 2012. The last six months with my iPhone 5, I suffered with a battery that would only last half a day and shut down suddenly when it reached 30% on the battery bar. We're not telling you this because we want to give a bad review of Apple's products; on the contrary, we want to demonstrate that one of the reasons iPhones are refreshed by consumers more often than iPads is because of the battery. A brand new iPhone or iPad connects the user into the Apple ecosystem in different but very similar ways, giving access to apps and files. Full-day usage of either product should not be an issue for new hardware. But an iPhone's battery will see diminishing life below a usable threshold faster than an iPad. This is simply due to the size and usage difference.
 9to5Mac did a poll with 14,980 votes on how often people upgrade their iPad. Over 40% upgrade "less often than every three years," with about 7% maybe upgrading annually. 

 Source: 9to5Mac We have a similar story with our Mac Air from 2012. But you get the point. We are still using it, but we are starting to see the battery life diminish. Almost time for a new one after five years. iPhone Refresh Cycle Less Than Half As Long Customers just want to get access to Apple's incredible ecosystem of apps and services. They can do that with a number of products, but so far they have chosen the iPhone by far. The iPhone is strategically positioned with a smaller battery that has just enough power as a new product, for a full day of heavy usage. With hardware upgrades coming with a premium price and often appealing to the early adopters, the majority of people will delay an upgrade until their current phone is causing them more headaches than providing value. For many, that means the battery is dying before they get home, they are tethered to a wall all the time, or attached to a power bank. The beauty and coolness of an iPhone are lost at this point. This has meant that the iPhone has had a refresh cycle of 1-3 years. This compares to longer battery life products like iPad and Mac which have 4-5 years or more to give. With the new iPhone "Plus" versions getting bigger batteries, we could see upgrade cycles on these Plus versions extending a bit longer. Of course, there are many other reasons people choose iPhones like portability, capability, usability, etc. What does this mean financially? First on the Ecosystem Apple's ecosystem is a hidden asset in its Services revenue line. Services has grown at 20% CAGR for the last eight years, and Apple's goal is to double the revenue between now and 2020, which implies a 19% CAGR. Through the first two quarters of 2017, it has posted 18% y/y growth consistently, with the App Store growing at 40% y/y in 2Q17. We think the Apple Pay Cash Card could add a billion dollars to the bottom line in a few years as well. See our article Apple Bank.
 On a top-line basis, Apple Services may never eclipse hardware products due to the difference in margin profiles. But we believe in the long term, Apple Services will mature into the largest contributor to the bottom line for Apple. Hardware has already just become an accessory to the functionality of the Services ecosystem. iPad Apple reached peak iPad in 2013; this is year four since then. After two quarters in 2017, iPad sales are down 17% y/y. A sign that this may not be the refresh year. But arguably 2018 will be pushing the boundaries of the five-year-old iPad Air's capabilities. We're forecasting 2017 iPad units to decline by 12% y/y to 40 million iPads. However, in 2018, we expect the trend to start reversing as the five-year refresh cycle starts to take hold. At the end of the day, we still believe there is a time and place for an iPad in the house. We don't always want to turn our computers on, but we want a bigger screen as well. 

 Note: Units in thousands. Green bars are author's forecast Source: Author, Apple We see Mac units holding steady in the middle of a 15-20 million unit range for the next two years as well as they have over the last six years. iPhone We see iPhone as a mature product now. This year, we expect some purchase delays will limit the unit growth. "It's that there are more rumors floating and more press articles and mentions of new things, and when that happens, a percentage of people delay. And so, yeah, we see a piece of that. That probably affects us more in China than other places because there's a tendency there to buy the latest thing." - CEO Tim Cook on CNBC But with an expected 10-year anniversary of iPhone in the fall/winter, 2018 should see a lift from delayed upgrades. Though a potential supply shortage could limit the upside. Given the maturity of the iPhone and the already short refresh cycle, the relative impact is expected to be minimal. We forecast 1% y/y unit growth in 2017 to 215 million units, and 5% y/y unit growth in 2018 to 227 million units, as the majority of new iPhones will fall into fiscal 2018.
 

 Note: Units in thousands. Green bars are author's forecast Source: Author, Apple Wrap Up Apple is a "single product company," but that product is not the iPhone. It's the services ecosystem. When the iPhone and smartphones are disrupted by a new user interface like AR, we will still be long Apple because the ecosystem is a huge moat in our minds. The ecosystem of services is much harder to disrupt. It is made of so many components, developers, and partners. It provides so much utility for so many people. Even if the way we access it changes, it will continue to provide incredible utility. Apple's ecosystem is a hidden asset in its Services revenue line. Services are targeted to double by 2020, implying a 19% CAGR. Apple Services may never eclipse hardware products in revenue, but we believe in the long term, Apple Services will mature into the largest contributor to the bottom line for Apple. We think the Apple Pay Cash Card could add a billion dollars to the bottom line in a few years as well. See our article Apple Bank. Follow us if you like our insight.

Hi John, Thank you for your expertise and, more important, for your kindness because they make me, almost, look forward to my next computer problem. After the next problem comes, I'll be delighted to correspond again with you. I'm told that I excel at programing. But system administration has never been one of my talents. So it's great to have an expert to rely on when the computer decides to stump me. God bless, Bill
