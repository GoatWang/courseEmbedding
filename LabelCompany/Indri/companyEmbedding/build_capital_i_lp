        Launching a new business requires much skill and preparation. Entrepreneurs may
        not have the resources to raise capital in order to market their new business ideas;
        therefore, some great business
            ideas never become commercialized. This is a common dilemma that many entrepreneurs
        face. They often speculate about how to raise capital and same time, are unsure
        about how their startup will have the needed financial security to properly stay
        on track. Before a new business owner can raise capital for their startup, they
        must first identify the different sources of funding, find one that is most compatible
        with their needs, and then meet the given criteria of the investor or bank. These
        crucial steps can mean the difference between having the opportunity to successfully
        raise capital and leaving their new business ideas behind.

Research- Entrepreneurs are encouraged to first investigate their
        funding options and conduct comprehensive market research to fully understand their
        potential targeted consumer base and any major competitors. Such information can
        be readily available both online and offline.


The information superhighway
The internet has become the fastest and most efficient means by which a
            new business owner can perform market research and find out 
                ways to raise capital. One important website to visit is the Small Business
            Administration (SBA) (www.SBA.gov), which can provide the necessary facts and resources
            needed for starting their new business. Every entrepreneur should take advantage
            of this valuable online resource so that they can become aware of all the different
            types of funding available. They will also be able to learn about how to meet the
            desired criteria in order to effectively 
raise capital for their new business. 

Offline resources
In addition to online resources, new business owners can also visit the
            public library or read through the local newspaper to find out more information
            on how to raise capital. The prospective business owner can also speak to successful
            
entrepreneurs who have experience in the field. Since experienced entrepreneurs
            have been through this process already, they can provide a wealth of information
            to the new business owner. The entrepreneur can also build a network of contacts
            through them, receive constructive advice, and find out how they can raise capital
            for their new business. Every entrepreneur can greatly benefit from an experienced
            business owner’s wisdom, further giving them a leading advantage to raise
            capital.
        


Identify Sources of Capital
        There are different types of financing that will enable an entrepreneur to raise
        capital for their new business:


Equity financing- This is a type of financing is essentially an
            exchange of money for a piece of ownership in a new business. This type of financing
            can usually be provided by 
venture capitalists and angel investors.


            An advantage of using equity financing
            as a way to raise capital is that the new business owner can pay back the loaned
            amount throughout a fixed duration of time. In addition, the new business owner
            can focus on making their product(s) profitable rather than worrying about paying
            back the investors immediately.
        

            One possible disadvantage of utilizing equity financing to raise capital is that
            the new business owner may lose partial or complete autonomy over their new business.
            Often times, angel investors or 
venture capitalists may want to have a large share
            in their invested company as well as have a say in every business decision made,
            including routine ones. A new business owner needs to explore the different options
            to raise capital as well as consider each of its benefits and disadvantages before
            deciding on what suits their new business the best.
        


Personal funding
Using personal finances or “bootstrapping” is one of the first
                sources that an entrepreneur may consider using when they decide to raise capital
                for their new business. Money can be obtained from personal checking and savings
                accounts, credit cards, and retirement accounts. In addition, equity can be collected
                from the sale of real estate properties, vehicles, recreational equipment, and even
                rare collectables. In fact, some wealthy entrepreneurs can choose to raise capital
                for their new business using their own personal funding. On the other hand, many
                new business owners may opt to utilize a combination of different sources to raise
                capital. 
            

Friends and family
Other than self-financing, family members and friends can provide an additional
                means to raise capital for a new business. Many of these loans can be made available
                rather quickly because these families and associates know the entrepreneur personally
                and enjoy the excitement of the 
new business venture. Borrowing money from friends
                and family can work both for and against the new business owner. Family members
                and friends may feel that they should have say in every company decision or may
                desire a large stake in the new business since they had lent money to the entrepreneur.
                This can lead to resentment and relationship strains among all parties involved.
                New business owners need to evaluate the different possibilities that may occur
                when they decide to use their friends and family members to raise capital since
                it can result in complicated matters.
            


                    Angel investors and 
                        venture capitalists
                New business owners can also raise capital from angel investors and venture capitalists
                through equity financing. By investing in the equity of a business, angel investors
                and venture capitalists expect a large return on investment in the form of an acquisition,
                IPO, or stock buy back in the future. While this may not seem the most attractive,
                it is certainly an avenue to explore, especially if all traditional routes to raise
                capital have been exhausted. One disadvantage of equity financing is that even though
                the new business owner may be able to 
raise capital, they may have to give up some
                of their company’s rights, since angel investors and venture capitalists often
                desire a large stake in the company or executive board seat. For many entrepreneurs,
                angel investors and venture capitalists may be their only resort to raise capital
                for their new businesses.
            


Debt financing- 
New business owners can also raise capital through
            debt financing. In its simplest terms, “debt financing” means a loan.
            Usually, this form of capital for a new business is offered by banks and accredited
            government agencies, such as the Small Business Administration.
        

            When new business owners use debt financing as a means to raise capital, he/she
            will owe money to the lending agency, which is usually a bank. The strong relationship
            between the new business owner and the financial institution continues for the life
            of the loan and ends once the new business owner pays back the entire amount.

            An advantage of debt financing
            as a way to raise capital is that the entrepreneur is able to retain maximum control
            over their new business. In addition, interest on debt financing is often tax deductible.
            However, one disadvantage of debt financing is that the high debt may look unattractive
            to other investors who are also involved in the project. This money owed may discourage
            other financiers from lending further funding and can often disqualify a new business
            owner from the opportunity to raise capital in the future.
        


Secured vs. unsecured business loans
                Business loans provide new business owners exactly what they are looking for: the
                necessary funding to raise capital for their new businesses. These loans are offered
                as either secured or unsecured debts, which are specially designed to fit the monetary
                requirements of the new business owners.
            


Secured loans- If the new business owner decides to apply for a
                    secured loan, they will need to find collateral in order to raise capital for their
                    new business. Personal, commercial or residential properties, invoices, or even
                    recreational equipments can be considered deposits to secure the loan. Secured loans
                    are a popular alternative for entrepreneurs to raise capital for their new businesses.


Unsecured loans- If the new business owner does not want to use
                    collateral as a form of security to 
raise capital for their new business, they have
                    the option to apply for an unsecured loan.  Even though unsecured loans are
                    not as large in amount as secured loans, this may be more compatible with the new
                    business owner’s needs. An unsecured loan is also a popular option to raise
                    capital for a new business.

                    In both types of business loans, entrepreneurs are able to raise capital for their
                    new business based on their credit rating.
                



Different bank loans and online applications
            There are different types of loans that can provide new business owners with the
            means to 
raise capital. These loans are classified according to the size of the
            planned business. The most common types are start-up business loans, small scale
            business loans, large business loans, and new business loans.

            Many financial lenders can now offer 
entrepreneurs the opportunity to raise capital
            for their new businesses by applying for a bank loan online. Upon application receipt,
            the new business owner’s information will be thoroughly analyzed for approval
            or rejection. All the information completed by the new business owner is strictly
            confidential and is transmitted through a secure server. If the entrepreneur needs
            an estimation of how much funding is needed to 
raise capital for their new business
            or inquires about the costs of monthly payments, they can utilize an online loan
            calculator which is provided by many financial institutions. Online loan applications
            are a fast way for new business owners to raise capital.

Government funding and the SBA
            Government loans by the 
Small Business Administration are also considered a valuable
            source for new business owners who seek to raise capital.  Since their inception
            in 1953, the SBA has provided a resourceful means for several thousands of new business
            owners to raise capital. In fact, the SBA has financed more than 219,000 new business
            owners with loans of more than $ 45 billion. The role of the SBA in providing new
            business owners the opportunity to raise capital has dramatically increased in the
            last decade. In the past 10 years, the SBA has enabled almost 435,000 new businesses
            a total amount of more than $94.6 billion. It is no wonder that the SBA is considered
            to be one of the leading resources for 
new business owners to raise capital.
        

            However, before approaching the SBA as a source to raise capital, entrepreneurs
            should be aware that the SBA does not lend money directly to new businesses, but
            instead, acts as a guarantor through a network of local lending partners to help
            promote the startup, growth, and success of small businesses in the United States.
            Since every new business is different and has its own specific monetary needs, entrepreneurs
            need to properly estimate how much capital will be needed for their new businesses.
            Some new businesses can be started on a small budget, while others may require considerable
            investment in inventory or equipment. It is vital for entrepreneurs to estimate
            this amount before deciding to 
raise capital through the SBA.

The advantages of applying for an SBA loan
            The advantage of applying to the SBA for startup capital is that it offers more
            flexibility than other loans that are offered by traditional lending institutions.
            However, new business owners may not find the SBA an easy source to raise capital.
            
New business owners who are planning to raise capital through the SBA need to meet
            minimum criteria and furnish details of their business profile, loan request amount,
            collateral details, business financial statements, and personal financial statements.
        

            Most financial analysts suggest that 
new business owners should be able to raise
            capital easily through prequalification. Prequalified capital can be made possible
            through intermediary organizations which assist prospective borrowers in developing
            viable loan application packages and securing loans. Many of these preapproved loans
            are made available to many minority groups.

Determine Your Startup Expenses
Once a new business owner identifies the different sources of funding available,
            they should now determine the amount of money that is needed to 
raise capital. Startup
            fees can be rather steep since office expenses (including rent and utilities), research,
            development and marketing costs, technological expenses, and employee payroll and
            benefits are considered to be necessary business expenditures. Legal and professional
            fees should also be considered as well as the basic living salary for the new business
            owners for at least one year. During a young company’s initial years, all
            of these expenses can accumulate very rapidly, discouraging new business owners
            how to productively raise capital. However, with a solid business plan as well as
            ample industry and funding research, new business owners can definitely increase
            their chance to raise capital for their new business.

Financial crisis can mean failure
            There are many reasons why new businesses do not succeed; however, deficient funding
            remains one of the significant reasons behind a company’s failure. In fact,
            all too often, the amount to raise capital for a 
new business can be frequently
            overlooked. In addition, many entrepreneurs with precarious economic circumstances
            are putting their new businesses at risk for failure simply because they have underestimated
            the monetary costs of running their new business. Rather than resorting to raise
            capital elsewhere, these new business owners tend to limit much of their business-related
            expenses which immediately restrict their new business’ capacity. As a result,
            this greatly threatens their company’s potential growth and stability.
        

Seeking financial help from outside sources
            If any new business owner is ever in a desperate financial situation and  need
            additional capital to sustain their 
new business or to revive their finances, then
            they are strongly recommended to raise capital from outside sources. This can come
            in the form of a loan, either from a bank, friends and family, or personal investors,
            such as an angel investor, who can all effectively raise capital for a new business.
            Although many new business owners may underestimate their start-up costs, they should
            not be discouraged about their rapidly growing expenses since many different exist
            to raise capital. It is extremely important to research all of the different avenues
            thoroughly in order to become familiar with the various choices and the processes
            involved in order make a well-planned and educated decision. Education and preparation
            are the two most important components that will lead 
new business owners to successfully
            raise capital.


What You Need Before Going to an Investor or Bank


The importance of a business plan
        In order to effectively 
raise capital, every new business idea with marketable potential
        should always be accompanied by a well-constructed, comprehensive business plan.
        To create such an extraordinary business plan, new business owners must first organize
        their thoughts, and then create a documented first draft. New business owners are
        also encouraged to seek the assistance in proof-reading in order to avoid any errors,
        which can seriously damage their overall credibility and chance to raise capital.
        A well-written business plan is the key for new business owners to successfully
        raise capital.

        Many 
successful entrepreneurs strongly believe that preparing a business plan is
        similar to writing a resume. The new business owner has to focus on every detail,
        explain their academic background and credentials, and clarify how their experience
        could add value to the new business endeavor. In addition to providing several references,
        the business plan should be constructed in such a way that it leaves potential investors
        speechless, with no further questions asked. By creating a well-prepared, solid
        business plan, new business owners will greatly increase their chance to raise capital
        for their new business endeavor. In addition, their solid business plan will also
        improve their chance to raise capital throughout the development of their new business.

        To further increase one’s chance to raise capital, new business owners are
        encouraged to seek the help of professional legal consultants or accountants. These
        professionals serve as a valuable resource to 
new business owners who want to raise
        capital since they can provide new business owners with all of the necessary paperwork
        for their business plan. They can even develop the entire business plan for the
        new business owner. But before seeking their help, the new business owner must make
        sure that these professionals are accredited and that they have experience in the
        field of new business startups. The assistance of accredited, experienced professionals
        when preparing a business plan will definitely impress investors, increasing the
        entrepreneur’s chance to effectively raise capital.

Fixed vs. variable expenses
        In addition to a solid business plan, new business owners must be able to differentiate
        between two types of expenses that they will have. These essential startup expenses
        can be divided into two separate categories: fixed and variable. Once both types
        of costs are evaluated and a total amount can be predicted. Bankers and 
investors
        expect new business owners to know these costs in order to estimate how much capital
        will be awarded.


Fixed expenses- New business owners need to consider the amount
            they have to pay for rent, utilities, administrative costs, and insurance costs
            when they decide to raise capital.
        

Variable expenses- New business owners also need to take into account
            inventory, shipping and packaging costs, sales commissions, and other costs associated
            with the direct sale of a product or service for their 
new business when they decide
            to raise capital.
        


Things That Matter to an Investor

Financial projections in the business plan
        There is no doubt that an effective business plan is needed to successfully raise
        capital. Included in a business plan should be a financial worksheet which outlines
        all the various categories of costs that can accrue monthly. By using a financial
        worksheet, the new business owner can provide lenders and investors three very important
        financial measures in order to 
raise capital- the income statement, cash flow statement,
        and balance sheet. The income statement is probably the most important component
        of the three to raise capital. It includes a projected cost report, which provides
        projected revenues and the expected income for the new business owner in the next
        3 to 5 years. Providing such financial predictions will enable the new business
        owner will gain credibility from their financial lenders. It also gives them an
        assertive edge to raise capital from additional sources.

Professionalism
        Whether an entrepreneur decides to raise capital from traditional bank loans or
        from angel investors, new business owners will first have to impress them with their
        business plan. New business owners should be aware that despite the possibility
        of multiple rejections, they must not be discouraged and always keep a positive,
        professional attitude. If an entrepreneur strongly believes in their project, then
        they will seek any and all means to 
raise capital. If an investor or financial lender
        sees potential in an entrepreneur’s new business ideas, then they will strongly
        consider the opportunity to enable the new business owner to raise capital and provide
        funding for their new business endeavor.

Good credit vs. bad credit
        Credit rating has become a very significant component when a new business owner
        decides to raise capital. This policy holds true for every financial lender: the
        higher the credit score, the lower the interest rates. If a new business owner has
        bad credit ratings, such as 600 and below, then they will most likely not be able
        to effectively raise capital since there is a high probability that their loan application
        will be denied. The 
entrepreneurs that seek to raise capital for their new business
        in large amounts and are planning to borrow this money from a bank should try to
        monitor their credit score and fix their credit history beforehand so that they
        can get new business loans at favorable rates. There is no doubt that a high credit
        score is a vital component to raise capital for a new business.
    

        A few years ago, there were several financial institutions and banks with a scoring
        rank system that automatically determined the new business owner’s interest
        rates. However, nowadays, there are multiple credit rating agencies that diligently
        analyze the new business owner’s credit score before granting capital. For
        a new business to effectively raise capital, the new business owner must have a
        good credit rating.

        Many 
entrepreneurs will agree that it is not an easy task to raise capital for their
        new business. The credit score agencies can easily determine the credit ratings
        of an entrepreneur simply by collecting information on the new business and analyzing
        the details, such as the borrower’s current income level, payment and debt
        history, and other important financial facts that may be useful in the process to
        raise capital. After credit agencies obtain a detailed report on the borrower, this
        information is sold to loan providing organizations, which further determine the
        amount of capital to be allocated.  Whether an entrepreneur is seeking funding
        from a private investor or lending institution, their credit history will be investigated
        before they are able to raise capital for their new business.

        owners the opportunity to raise capital from investors around the world. By advertising

Conclusion
There are many different funding options available to new business owners
        who are seeking to raise capital. However, before they resume their funding quest,
        new business owners should identify the different sources of capital and are encouraged
        to diligently work on meeting the required criteria. This includes ample industry
        research, the creation of an effective business plan, and credit report maintenance
        and repairs.

        While personal savings and money from family and friends can be readily available,
        it may not be enough to 
raise capital. Instead, new business owners can raise capital
        from financial institutions, government grants, and even from angel investors and
        venture capitalists.  A fast means by which new business owners can effectively
        raise capital is through online networks such as Go4Funding.com. As a member, new
        business owners can increase their chance to raise capital by posting their capital
        necessities online where it will be viewable by accredited investors from around

        main source to raise capital for their businesses while investors depend on Go4Funding.com
        for investment opportunities. If you are a new business owner who is seeking to

The word “Disrupt” is thrown around a lot in our industry. However, what does it mean to truly “disrupt” an industry? We look for entrepreneurs with a global vision – that intelligently apply technological solutions and unique business models to disrupt what many consider boring and archaic industries.
Our aim is to re-educate people, change traditional mind-sets and create long-term value. We love companies that create businesses that become invaluable and build products that we never thought possible, but “could never live without”- think google, Shazam, Facebook,
