History[edit]
Name Change: The Company changed its name to "Infosys Technologies Private Limited" in April 1992 and to "Infosys Technologies Limited" when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to "Infosys Limited" in June 2011.[6]
An initial public offer (IPO) in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹480 or US$7.50 in 2016) per share against book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹100 or US$1.60 in 2016) per share. The Infosys IPO was under subscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley which picked up 1 28% of equity at the offer price.[7] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹740 or US$11 in 2016) per share.[8]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

History[edit]
Name Change: The Company changed its name to "Infosys Technologies Private Limited" in April 1992 and to "Infosys Technologies Limited" when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to "Infosys Limited" in June 2011.[6]
An initial public offer (IPO) in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹480 or US$7.50 in 2016) per share against book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹100 or US$1.60 in 2016) per share. The Infosys IPO was under subscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley which picked up 1 28% of equity at the offer price.[7] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹740 or US$11 in 2016) per share.[8]
In October 1994, it made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 (equivalent to ₹2,100 or US$32 in 2016) each against book value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹46 or 71¢ US in 2016) per share to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and Corporates.[9]
In March 1999, it issued 2,070,000 ADSs (equivalent to 1,035,000 equity shares of par value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹30 or 47¢ US in 2016) each) at US$34 (equivalent to $48.88 in 2016) per ADS under the American Depositary Shares Program and the same were listed on the NASDAQ National Market in US. The total issue amount was US$70.38 million.[10]
The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹24,000 or US$380 in 2016) by 1999 making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the NASDAQ.[7]
During July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, it made secondary ADS issues of US$294 (equivalent to $382.76 in 2016) million, US$1.07 (equivalent to $1.31 in 2016) billion and US$1.605 (equivalent to $1.91 in 2016) billion respectively.[11]
In December 2002, Infosys transferred the listing of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) from the NASDAQ to the NYSE.[12]
In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary called, EdgeVerve Systems., focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network domains.[13]
In August 2015, the Finacle Global Banking Solutions assets were officially transferred from Infosys and became part of the product company EdgeVerve Systems product portfolio.[14]
The credit rating of the company is A- (given by Standard & Poor's on 13-Dec-2013).[15] In February 2015, Infosys announced it would acquire the US automation technology company Panaya for around $200 million.[16]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]

The Infosys IPO was under subscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley which picked up 1 28% of equity at the offer price.[7] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹740 or US$11 in 2016) per share.[8]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]

Company background
Infosys is India's second-largest information technology service company. It develops and maintains software for corporate customers and also provides a wide range of IT-related services, including consulting.

     The company serves customers in more than 50 countries and has a global workforce of more than 160,000 people. Of its consolidated sales, more than 90% are generated in overseas markets, including the U.S.

     Infosys symbolizes the Indian IT industry's rapid progress. It was established with $250 capital in 1981 by seven co-founders. It grew in the 1990s, mainly by winning contracts to develop software and systems for overseas clients. India's IT industry attracted attention when they handled contracts related to the Y2K problem, which was expected to lead to computer problems in 2000. Infosys rapidly moved up the ladder to become a global IT business. In 1999, it became the first Indian company to list on the Nasdaq in New York.

     Co-founders and their families have a combined equity stake of more than 10% in Infosys.  Since the company's establishment, four co-founders, including Narayana Murthy, served as CEOs. However, in 2014, Vishal Sikka, a former executive at German software maker SAP, became the company's first CEO from outside the group of co-founders.

History[edit]
Name Change: The Company changed its name to "Infosys Technologies Private Limited" in April 1992 and to "Infosys Technologies Limited" when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to "Infosys Limited" in June 2011.[6]
An initial public offer (IPO) in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹480 or US$7.50 in 2016) per share against book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹100 or US$1.60 in 2016) per share. The Infosys IPO was under subscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley which picked up 1 28% of equity at the offer price.[7] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹740 or US$11 in 2016) per share.[8]
In October 1994, it made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 (equivalent to ₹2,100 or US$32 in 2016) each against book value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹46 or 71¢ US in 2016) per share to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and Corporates.[9]

The total issue amount was US$70.38 million.[10]
The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹24,000 or US$380 in 2016) by 1999 making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the NASDAQ.[7]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

History[edit]
Name Change: The Company changed its name to "Infosys Technologies Private Limited" in April 1992 and to "Infosys Technologies Limited" when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to "Infosys Limited" in June 2011.[6]
An initial public offer (IPO) in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹480 or US$7.50 in 2016) per share against book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹100 or US$1.60 in 2016) per share. The Infosys IPO was under subscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley which picked up 1 28% of equity at the offer price.[7] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹740 or US$11 in 2016) per share.[8]
In October 1994, it made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 (equivalent to ₹2,100 or US$32 in 2016) each against book value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹46 or 71¢ US in 2016) per share to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and Corporates.[9]
In March 1999, it issued 2,070,000 ADSs (equivalent to 1,035,000 equity shares of par value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹30 or 47¢ US in 2016) each) at US$34 (equivalent to $48.88 in 2016) per ADS under the American Depositary Shares Program and the same were listed on the NASDAQ National Market in US. The total issue amount was US$70.38 million.[10]
The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹24,000 or US$380 in 2016) by 1999 making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the NASDAQ.[7]
During July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, it made secondary ADS issues of US$294 (equivalent to $382.76 in 2016) million, US$1.07 (equivalent to $1.31 in 2016) billion and US$1.605 (equivalent to $1.91 in 2016) billion respectively.[11]
In December 2002, Infosys transferred the listing of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) from the NASDAQ to the NYSE.[12]
In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary called, EdgeVerve Systems., focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network domains.[13]
In August 2015, the Finacle Global Banking Solutions assets were officially transferred from Infosys and became part of the product company EdgeVerve Systems product portfolio.[14]
The credit rating of the company is A- (given by Standard & Poor's on 13-Dec-2013).[15] In February 2015, Infosys announced it would acquire the US automation technology company Panaya for around $200 million.[16]
Operations[edit]




Headquarters of Infosys in Bengaluru

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

History[edit]
Name Change: The Company changed its name to "Infosys Technologies Private Limited" in April 1992 and to "Infosys Technologies Limited" when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to "Infosys Limited" in June 2011.[6]
An initial public offer (IPO) in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹480 or US$7.50 in 2016) per share against book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹100 or US$1.60 in 2016) per share. The Infosys IPO was under subscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley which picked up 1 28% of equity at the offer price.[7] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹740 or US$11 in 2016) per share.[8]
In October 1994, it made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 (equivalent to ₹2,100 or US$32 in 2016) each against book value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹46 or 71¢ US in 2016) per share to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and Corporates.[9]
In March 1999, it issued 2,070,000 ADSs (equivalent to 1,035,000 equity shares of par value of ₹10 (equivalent to ₹30 or 47¢ US in 2016) each) at US$34 (equivalent to $48.88 in 2016) per ADS under the American Depositary Shares Program and the same were listed on the NASDAQ National Market in US. The total issue amount was US$70.38 million.[10]
The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹24,000 or US$380 in 2016) by 1999 making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the NASDAQ.[7]
During July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, it made secondary ADS issues of US$294 (equivalent to $382.76 in 2016) million, US$1.07 (equivalent to $1.31 in 2016) billion and US$1.605 (equivalent to $1.91 in 2016) billion respectively.[11]
In December 2002, Infosys transferred the listing of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) from the NASDAQ to the NYSE.[12]
In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary called, EdgeVerve Systems., focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network domains.[13]
In August 2015, the Finacle Global Banking Solutions assets were officially transferred from Infosys and became part of the product company EdgeVerve Systems product portfolio.[14]
The credit rating of the company is A- (given by Standard & Poor's on 13-Dec-2013).[15] In February 2015, Infosys announced it would acquire the US automation technology company Panaya for around $200 million.[16]

Controversies[edit]
Accusation of visa fraud[edit]
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[54] it along with another similar case,[55][56][57] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities — and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[58]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[59] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[60] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[61]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney[edit]
In 2015, the Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.[62]The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.[63]
Deals[edit]

House of Fraser, a British-based department store opted for Infosys as strategic partner to transform its business channel, IT infrastructure and to expand its global footprint. This multiyear deal is signed in the presence of Mr. Yuan Yafei, Chairman, Sanpower Group and Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys.[64]
Infosys signed up multi year agreement with Deutsche Bank for supporting in development, application maintenance, digital and mobility, package implementation and testing services.[65]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
