The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

About Abeona Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: ABEO) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases.    Developing therapies for rare disease requires new approaches and strong collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups.  Abeona was forged from the company’s close collaborations with key stakeholders all dedicated to transforming new biotechnology insights into breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.
 Our MissionAdvancing treatments for rare diseases…Working together to find a cure.
A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.  There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death.  More than 25 million Americans and 30 million Europeans have one.
While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million); and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life.
These rare diseases are often poorly diagnosed, very complex, and have no treatment or not very effective treatment—over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment.  However, most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes—80% are genetic in origin and can present at any stage of life.
We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.
 Product PipelineAbeona Therapeutics is working on a number of exciting technologies and products aimed at curing various rare diseases. Find out what we’re working on and what we have planned.

Gene TherapyIn many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient’s cells.

Research in the Pearce Lab is focused on understanding the molecular basis of several inherited pediatric neurodegenerative diseases including the infantile, late infantile and juvenile onset forms of Batten disease. Dr. Pearce and his team use mouse and miniature pig models of these rare, fatal diseases to reveal molecular and cellular pathomechanisms, to identify new therapeutic targets and to test new therapeutic approaches.Brian Kaspar, PhDBrian Kaspar, PhD is Professor, Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Ohio State University Brian K.

I was attracted to pediatric neurology when I was a medical student and realized that I had an intellectual interest in the brain but enjoyed the challenges and rewards of caring for children. As a movement disorders specialist, I care for children with a variety of conditions that impair voluntary movements, cause involuntary movements, or both. Such conditions include dystonia, chorea, tics, myoclonus, tremor, stereotypies, parkinsonism, and combinations of these such as may occur in conditions like cerebral palsy. In addition to movement disorders, neurodegenerative diseases are also a focus of my clinical practice.
 My research has been focused on understanding brain mechanisms involved in the control of movement or where disorders cause involuntary movements. The research involves neurophysiology, direct measurement of movement abnormalities, rating scales, and longitudinal assessments over the course of development and disease. More recently my work as included clinical trials and studies of factors that impact the function of children with movement disorders.
 In addition to my clinical practice and research, I direct the Child Neurology residency at the University of Rochester. I serve on a number of advisory boards including the Tourette Syndrome Association, the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, the Batten Disease Support and Research Association, the NINDS Board of Scientific Counselors, and the Pediatric Advisory Committee of the FDA. I am also an Associate Editor of NeurologyJohn Cooper, PhDPlasma-Based ProductsEugene J.
