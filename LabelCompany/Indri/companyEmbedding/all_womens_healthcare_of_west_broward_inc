Specialties





Obstetrics and Gynecology







    An obstetrician & gynecologist, or OB/GYN, is a physician who cares for women throughout their pregnancies, straight through to the delivery of their baby (obstetrician). They also specialize in annual care, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system (gynecologist). Many physicians specialize in both of these fields in order to provide complete overall health services to women at every stage of life.

Information about group practices



What is a Group Practice?

                According to The Medical Group Management Association, a group practice is any relationship between three or more physicians who share facilities, expenses, profits and other resources like support staff and equipment.
            

                Group practices tend to fall into two categories: those  that organize around a particular medical specialty and those that encompass several specialties like East Boston Neighborhood Health that specializes in internal medicine.
            

Why Group Practice?

                As medicine became more complex in the twentieth century, the need for group practices made more sense. Physicians found it impossible to know everything about the emerging drugs and technologies on the medical landscape. In addition, the cost of providing a full range of diagnostic services, such as tests and X-rays, in one location became prohibitive to the individual practitioner. Hence, doctors from various disciplines began to team together in order to provide more comprehensive care to their community of patients.
            

Benefits of Group Practice


                    Access to doctors from various disciplines for referrals and advice
                

                    Better coverage on weekends and off-hours
                

                    One-stop clinics for comprehensive care and testing

Group PracticeA group practice is a group of doctors, dentists, nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and possibly other healthcare providers who practice together. Group practice providers share their individual knowledge, skills and resources to provide specialized and coordinated care to patients. A group practice may be a small group of providers that share a physical space, often located in a clinic, hospital department, or medical or dental office. Group practices may also be large and include hundreds of providers as part of an organized system of care, such as a large health plan or hospital system.Patients benefit by the medical knowledge of all specialists in a group practice. Group practices may specialize in an area of care (e.g., cardiac care) and include various specialists (e.g., cardiologist and cardiac surgeon). Together, these specialists provide comprehensive and efficient care to patients with simple to complex conditions. For example, a critically ill patient with advanced kidney disease can benefit from the expertise of a provider practice that includes specialists in nephrology and critical care medicine. Many group practices design care strategies to anticipate patient needs, prevent complications, maintain optimal health and function, and improve quality of care. To help in this goal, group practices frequently include other specialized healthcare professionals. This can include a counselor, dental hygienist, diabetes educator, dietician-nutritionist, and specialized registered nurses (RNs). For example, an orthopedic or sports medicine practice may include physical therapists and athletic trainers as part of the practice. Teamwork across specialties in a group practice is coordinated through the use of electronic health records; dedicated care managers (or care coordinators); evidence-based, recommended care guidelines; and systematic monitoring of quality and efficiency.
