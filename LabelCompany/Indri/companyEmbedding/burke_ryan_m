Here are answers to some common questions you may have about your care with Family Medicine.

What is Family Medicine? 

Family Medicine is a specialty devoted to comprehensive health care to people of all ages. It is based on the knowledge of the patient in the context of the family and the community, emphasizing disease prevention and health promotion. Family Physicians spend a minimum of 3 years after medical school in residency training which includes caring for newborns, children, adults and geriatric patients both in the office and in the hospital. The training includes Women’s Health and many office procedures. Some family physicians pursue additional training in Adolescent Medicine, Geriatric Medicine, Hospice and Palliative Medicine, Sleep Medicine or Sports Medicine. Depending on practice location or personal preference family physicians may limit their practice to adults and or older children.Physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants may practice in Family Medicine. Nurse practitioners are nurses with advanced education and licenses that allow them to diagnose and manage medical conditions within their specialty. Physician assistants are licensed to work under the supervision of a physician.



How do I choose a Family Medicine physician for myself or my family member?

You can browse through the professional and personal profiles of family physicians on this Web site. Our Choose your Doctor page will allow you to find physicians in your area. You can also see whether a physician is fluent in your primary language. Talk to your friends or to another physician you see at Kaiser Permanente; they might recommend a physician in your area.If you are pregnant, it’s a good idea to investigate which pediatricians or family medicine physicians would be a good fit for your family. If you have older children who have a particular physician, your new baby should be able to see the same one or you can choose someone new if you prefer.After the birth of your baby, you will be assigned a medical record number for the baby and can choose your pediatric or family medicine provider. If you do not have a specific preference for a particular provider, someone in the pediatric or family medicine department can help you choose.



How often should I come in to see my doctor? 

How often you come in for a visit is something you and your personal physician can discuss. Depending on your age and whether you have a chronic condition, you may need screening tests or immunizations. We feel it's very important to get all the preventive care you need. From birth until age 2, well care visits are generally scheduled every few months. As you age, the frequency may change and depends on whether you have a chronic condition or need screening tests or immunizations.



How often should my child or teen see the doctor?

From birth until age 2, well care visits are generally scheduled every few months. Once your child turns 2, we'll see you for well care visits every year or two until age 18.These visits help us make sure your children are growing and developing, and getting the care they need to stay healthy. Well check visits are also an opportunity for you to talk with your physician about questions you may have about your child's health and well being.We recommend that you bring your child in for routine well visits at the following ages. Note: Your physician may recommend a slightly different schedule, based on your child's individual health needs.Newborns
In many of our medical centers, we offer special newborn clubs or clinics just for new families. Services include newborn exams, breastfeeding support, newborn care information and advice, and immediate access to physicians as needed. Infancy

How often should I come in to see my doctor for women’s health?

Generally, we encourage women to come in for a well-woman check-up every 1 to 2 years, but this can vary:If you're under 25 and sexually active, you should be tested for sexually transmitted diseases every year. This can be done during a check-up with your Ob/Gyn doctor or with a general medicine doctor.Pap tests for cervical cancer screening should begin at age 21. If your Pap results are normal, you can wait as long as 3 years between tests. You can stop having Pap and HPV tests if you are over 65 and have had either three or more normal Pap tests in the past 10 years and/or you are HPV negative. You can also stop having Pap tests if you have had a total hysterectomy (where your cervix was also removed) and you have no history of cancer of the cervix, vulva, or vagina.If you are 40 or over, and you have no personal or family history of breast cancer, you should come in for a clinical breast exam and a mammogram every 1 to 2 years.If you have risk factors for breast cancer, you should talk to your physician about when to begin regular screening.



When does my child need immunizations?

Many parents have questions about immunizations. We encourage you to be informed so you'll feel confident vaccinating your child.We are dedicated to providing you with answers you can trust and links to unbiased information. Stay up to date with all recommended immunizations and you'll know your child is protected.Check to see what immunizations your child needs with our personalized online Preventive Services.  This summary can help you stay up to date with you and your family's recommended immunizations and screening tests.This is a secure online feature and requires that you have an active password for our member site and be authorized to use the Act for a Family Member feature.



What’s different about care for my teen?

In most cases, your teen needs parental permission before seeing a physician or nurse practitioner. However, adolescents 12 and older can make their own appointments for certain confidential services.Confidentiality laws also protect certain parts of a teen's medical records. For these reasons, parents and guardians of pediatric members ages 12 to 17 have slightly different levels of access to our secure online features. For more information about confidential care for teens, please review our Special Care for Your Teen handout.Resources for parents of teensWe want to work with you to teach teens to begin to take charge of their personal health care as they transition from childhood to adulthood.We know this is a big transition. To help you stay connected with your teen's doctor or nurse practitioner, we encourage to you sign up for our free Healthy Teens Online newsletter. You'll receive the latest in teen health information as well as parenting tips and resources, all delivered right to your inbox.

Common Questions about Radiation Exposure

What is radiation? Is it dangerous?

Radiation is simply waves of energy. There are 2 main types of radiation:Non-ionizing radiation, which is not considered dangerous. Ionizing radiation, which in high levels or large doses, can be harmful to cells.Even so, at lower levels, non-ionizing radiation can have several highly beneficial uses in medical care.  For example, we use ionizing radiation in controlled ways to help create diagnostic images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and nuclear scans. Radiation can also in the treatment of some cancers. Our goal is to avoid unnecessary patient exposure.



Can I avoid radiation?

You cannot avoid radiation entirely. Ionizing radiation comes from cosmic rays that reach us from space, and also from radioactive elements present in rocks and soil. You can minimize your exposure to ionizing radiation, but not eliminate it. The low level of radiation that we are exposed to at all times in our environment is known as “background” radiation.



Are medical X-rays dangerous?

Most medical X-rays use small amounts of ionizing radiation. A standard chest X-ray, for example, uses approximately the same amount of ionizing radiation as 10 days of natural background radiation, which we are all exposed to in day-to-day life. A mammogram has similar amounts of radiation exposure as 3 months of natural background radiation.CT scans use more radiation and the amount depends on how much of the body is scanned. For example, a CT scan of the head is equivalent to several months of normal background radiation while a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen may be similar to several years of natural background radiation. Even then, a CT scan can be life-saving when used appropriately. However, repeated CT scans may increase cancer risk.



Do the risks of using diagnostic images or radiation therapy outweigh the benefits?

In most instances, the diagnostic value of an X-ray or CT scan is considered well worth the small risk associated with the amount of radiation delivered. No single test can significantly increase a person’s lifetime chance of developing cancer. However, if someone has previously had radiation treatments or many CT scans over the course of a lifetime, this can add up to a risk factor that may be taken into account before ordering additional tests and procedures.We work hard to ensure that our imaging machines only use the lowest effective dose of radiation to get the images we need.



What can I do the help prevent unnecessary radiation exposure?

Ask if there are safe alternatives to ordering tests (especially the higher dosage CT scans). If you are tempted to ask your doctor for a test, consider the possible risks. Remember that in many conditions the test results are unlikely to change the treatment. And many tests show unimportant abnormalities that may require additional testing and even more unnecessary radiation exposure. If a diagnostic test is strongly recommended, it is done so with good reason. For example, the small radiation exposure of regular mammograms in women may save lives by detecting early, curable breast cancer. We will work closely with you to help make sure you get only the essential tests you need, and help you avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.



Can an ultrasound during pregnancy hurt my unborn baby?

No. Ultrasound imaging uses sound waves not X-rays or ionizing radiation. The ultrasound cannot harm an unborn baby during pregnancy.



Can an X-ray during pregnancy hurt my unborn baby?

In general, X-ray exposure from a single diagnostic procedure does not result in harmful effects to the baby. This is also true if you receive an X-ray before you know you are pregnant. However, we make every effort to avoid any X-ray procedures in women who are pregnant. If you continue to have concerns, be sure to discuss these concerns with us.



What is a nuclear scan?

Nuclear scans involve swallowing or injecting a tiny amount of radioactive material that acts as a tracking dye or coloring inside the body. The radioactivity allows a special camera to detect abnormalities or problems in targeted areas of the body such as bones or organs. The amount of ionizing radiation in a typical dose of nuclear medicine is very small and passes through the body in a few days.



If I am breastfeeding, can nuclear medicine enter breast milk?

Certain types of nuclear medicine may affect a mother’s breast milk for a short period of time, typically 24 to 72 hours. Many lactating mothers use a breast pump before a nuclear imaging study so that they can bottle feed breast milk to their babies for a few days following a nuclear medicine test.



Can radiation therapy used to treat cancer cause more cancer?

The type of radiation used to destroy cancer cells is ionizing radiation. During treatments the radiation is focused as much as possible on the cancer cells and avoids healthy tissue. However, there is some risk that radiation therapy may increase a person’s chances for developing a second cancer years later or other problems.



Do cell phones and other technology create harmful radiation?

Current evidence suggests that cell phone use does not pose a significant health hazard in terms or radiation exposure. Radio waves, power lines, cell phones, cell phone towers, TV screens, computer monitors, and microwave ovens all emit low-frequency, non-ionizing radiation, which is not considered a health hazard.Airport security scanners emit a very tiny amount of ionizing radiation – about one-thousandth of a standard chest X-ray. Ionizing radiation may be used to kill harmful germs on irradiated food, but the food itself does not remain radioactive.Cigarettes and tobacco products, however, do contain low levels of ionizing radiation that come from the soil, and may significantly increase smokers’ exposure to radiation over time.



Can too much sun cause cancers other than skin cancer?

No, because the sun’s ultraviolet rays – which are the ones that can potentially cause skin cancer – are not strong enough to penetrate through the skin. However, ultraviolet radiation used in tanning beds and sun lamps can increase the risk of skin cancer.



Should I take iodine pills to protect myself from radiation exposure?

No. Iodine pills (also known as potassium iodide) decrease or even shut down thyroid function, which can cause many problems. If an emergency situation arises, health officials will advise the public about the best and safest ways to prevent radiation exposure.

Why does access to my child’s information expire each year?

Profile




I wanted to be a physician since my friend died of leukemia in 3rd grade. But after growing up in a business-oriented family and observing the lack of coordination of care in my own grandparents' care in New York I realized there must be a better way to care for people. I witnessed the massive improvements in quality of care through the innovation of Kaiser Permanente’s prepaid model of care, systematic quality programs, and use of technology after moving to California in high school. I studied the Canadian health care system as my senior project while majoring in government and international relations as well as pre-professional studies (premed) at the University of Notre Dame. This helped to firm my beliefs that Kaiser Permanente was a superior model of care for a large population of patients. My desire to care for the whole person crystallized while at medical school as I was considering opportunities in several specialties. I joined the Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group in 1994 after deciding to remain on the East Coast after meeting my wife while in residency in North Carolina. I enjoy sports medicine in addition to developing long-standing physician-patient relationships in general family medicine during my 20 years with the medical group. My philosophy of care is to focus on you. It’s that simple.

  About Me: Outside the Office




Family and Friends
The one thing I love more than taking care of patients is my family – my wife and 2 young sons.My vacation days are filled with visiting my parents, 2 brothers and 2 sisters, 13 nieces and nephews, and my wife’s parents in various places around the country.

Hobbies and Interests
SportsI love sports – playing, watching, and coaching.I enjoy playing baseball, basketball and football with my sons in any free moment. Recently I’m focusing on making the time to hit an occasional bucket of golf balls with my family. I am planning on getting back to rowing and biking more.Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame – I am forever hopeful that Notre Dame football will return to national prominence. I still will see patients who graduated from Michigan, Ohio, USC, and Miami!I desperately try to keep sports fun coaching SYC basketball.HistoryI am especially drawn to the personal stories of strength of character in the Civil War and WWII that made our country great.










  Roles and Responsibilities


My specialty is caring for you – the whole you.As a family physician, I care for you no matter what the issue is and attain the assistance of my specialty colleagues when more expert specialty care is needed. Generally, about 85% of all presenting complaints can be managed by a family physician and the other 15% of the time people need the serves of a specialist.My responsibility is to provide or help coordinate care for patients from newborns to over age 100.Your responsibility as a patient is to participate in your treatment – both in planning and doing – to the best of your ability.

  My Colleagues


I have confidence in the care of my MAPMG colleagues provide to my family in yours. Dr. Saleh (family medicine, adult and children) and Dr. Huynh (internal medicine) will care for you if I am unavailable. I have worked with many of my MAPMG colleagues in various specialties for over 15 years and have been impressed with patients’ opinions of their personal bedside manners as well as their excellent care.




  My Staff


My staff is caring and supportive – of both me and my patients.  Judy and Sharon help patients check in at the front desk.  Teresa is the clinical assistant who I work with most frequently. She will prepare you for your visit by taking your vital signs, call or email you with messages and results, or call or email you with reminders about appointments or needed screening tests.  Deanna, Iris, Tram, and Ty also dependably assist me when Teresa is out of the office.  Jennifer, a licensed practical nurse, is the supervisor of the clinical assistants and provides immunizations.  Angie, Christina, Gayle, and Lucy are the registered nurses who triage, monitor, and care for patients in so many ways on the phone and in the office.








What My Patients Say


Dr. Ryan is extremely knowledgeable and thorough. He is very caring and explains everything including options. - GCI have a great doctor in Christopher Ryan. I followed him from one center to another. He is extremely knowledgeable, caring, and efficient. - AMI love Dr. Ryan! He is the best doctor I have ever had. He is very easy to talk to, about any problem you're having, he is easy to communicate with via email. I've always had good luck sending him emails requesting some sort of care and he is quick to respond. As far as office visits go, Dr. Ryan takes the time necessary to be sure you understand what the problem is. He is very patient. - DHI strongly recommend Dr. Chris Ryan. When he left the Springfield Office, I followed him to Burke. Dr. Ryan has always worked me into his schedule when I needed to see him. He is a knowledgeable and kind MD. - RADr. Ryan was my physician when I was a child. After the military, I had to find private healthcare and chose Dr. Ryan only because he was the only doctor I was familiar with. I've had numerous insurers, HMOs, and primary care physicians and he is by far the best I have ever had. He would always take the time to listen to problems and explain conditions so that I would understand what to expect and what I needed to do. He was always proactive with my health even when I was not. I've stayed with Kaiser Permanente because of him and come back to Kaiser Permanente because of him, both for my care and for the care of my family. He is exactly what a primary care physician should be. - AG
