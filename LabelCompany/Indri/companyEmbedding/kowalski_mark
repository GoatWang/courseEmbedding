About Dr. Kowalski, D.C.:
As a healthcare practitioner, I believe that personalized preventive care 
      is of the utmost importance in helping people achieve their health goals. 
      My education and experience in the healthcare field has enabled me to 
      incorporate a patient-centered approach to medicine that is tailored to 
      the unique needs of those who seek my counsel. Because beliefs, attitudes, 
      and motivations can all play a major role in overall wellness, I examine 
      and include the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of all of my 
      patients in order to make a more holistic and accurate diagnosis. My 
      devotion to good health is the basis and primary focus of my practice. I value the trust and confidence of my patients with whom I work in partnership for better health.

                                    Hello Everyone.
I have been away for awhile,due to illness. I am back and ready to get back to work. Living in Calgary,Alberta, and at this point in time we are in a state of emergency. Calgary and Area is pretty much flooded and 100,000 people have been evacuated. So far I am fortunate and am high and dry. I am working from home office which is good. I am so happy that so far, there has been no loss of life. People have rallied together to help each other and many of us  who are dry are inviting the flood victims into our  private homes. Where there is no room centres have been set up and volunteers are helping out. The army is here to rescue those who cannot be reached.

                                    I cannot recall in my life, ever have knowing a set of twins. Would you believe that in the past four months I have done wedding videos for three sets of twins. Not just twins, but identical twins. And I mean identical.
Adding to that, I took another booking for a wedding video today and for the second time in a month, I am doing a wedding video where the brides name is Samantha and the grooms name is Chris.

                                    Working From Home

A Little Effort Leads To A Wealth Of Success

What would you do if you no longer had to worry about money? Where would you go? How would you spend your time?

If you�re like most people, you rarely stop to think about these kinds of questions. Too busy caught up in the day-to-day rat race, you�ve forgotten the dreams you had for yourself and your loved ones . . . or at least put them on the back burner for �later.�

Meanwhile, your life is passing you by. Birthdays come and go. Days blend into weeks and months, with only the occasional vacation or major life change to mix things up.

You know there must be more to life, but you�re not sure where to even begin making a change.

Here�s a thought for you: what if you could work from home? http://www.lifestylebusinessonline.com

                                    Hi everyone. I have just joined whoswho so would like to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I am from Brisbane, Australia.I am a videographer specialising in weddings. I will of course take on any other event that a client wants videoed.
Filming and photography has been a hobby since as far back as 1968, but it has only been in the last 12 months that I have taken it up as a full time job. This was due to restructering at my last job that made my position surplus. Having worked in the electrical and electronics fields all my life, I thought that this was all I could do, then suddenly I realised - hey, i have a lifetime hobby that i enjoy and have learnt so much about - step outside the square you've been boxed up in all those years and do something different. If you wish to have a look at my website you will find it at www.alloccasionsvideos.com.au

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreArea RugsArea rugs provide both functional and stylistic value to a bedroom. They protect your floor from wear and tear (and your feet from a cold floor!), as well as enhance a room’s personality with the various colors, patterns, textures, shapes and sizes that area rugs come in.  When choosing a  bedroom rug, take the following rule of thumb into consideration: Extend the carpet 12-18 inches around the bed. For a king or queen bed, the rug should extend 18 inches out from the sides; for a twin or a full bed, it should extend at least 12 inches out. Depending on the size of the room there can be more extension around the bed, but most definitely not less, as that would make the room look imbalanced and cover the entirety of the rug design with the bed. A few other things to consider — what is your lifestyle like? Do you have pets or children? A white carpet might not be the best alternative in this case, and a sturdier, long-lasting material like wool or jute should be considered. What is your decor style? Make sure you choose a rug that complements and enhances your current aesthetic. How easy is it to clean? Consider if your rug will need to be dry cleaned or if standard vacuuming and carpet cleaning will suffice. Pillows & ThrowsAdding decorative pillows and throw blankets to a bedroom is one of the easiest and most effective ways to enhance your  decor. However, before you start your hunt for the perfect pillow and throw blanket assemblage, consider your current bedroom design. If you have a neutral color palette of soft grays and whites, a few brightly colored pillows or blankets will provide energetic pops of color. If you already have a colorful home, throwing in some subtler shades and patterns might be exactly what you need to complement your style and put the focal point on your polychromatic decor. In general, you should place two to six decorative pillows on your bed. This will be enough to add a new element of style and color, but not so much that you’ll have to spend 20 minutes removing pillows before you go to sleep. Throw blankets can be great arranged at the end of your bed, showcasing their texture and pattern, or elegantly draped over an armchair, ready to snuggle up with.Table LampsTable lamps are one of those great decor items with a dual purpose — they are a complementary accent to your home while providing much-needed light. When choosing lamps, consider this design rule: You should not be able to see the neck of the light bulb, or bulb socket, from a standing or seated position. If you can see it, the lamp is likely too tall for your room and will cause glare for anyone standing or sitting in your bedroom (most likely you!). However, if you find a tall base that you just have to have, get a larger lamp shade to cover the bulb and you’re all set! Tall lamps definitely contribute to an elegant ambience and elevate your room design to new heights (literally). If you want mood lighting or just a more decorative piece, utilize an opaque shade; if you’re an avid reader or need more light in your room, use a translucent lampshade that distributes light throughout the space. Wall Decor & MirrorsThe decor in your  bedroom should be reflective of this space’s purpose - your bedroom is your refuge, your retreat from the real world, and it should make you feel happy, content and inspired. Put up items that create a sense of peace; if you have any specific pictures or pieces that make you happy or remind you of fun times, these are great to include in your design. If you have a large piece of wall art to hang, put it in a place where it can be a focal point and won’t be overshadowed by clutter or other decor.  Hanging and placing mirrors throughout your bedroom will reflect light and make it look larger, as well as provide you ample opportunity to check out your outfit before work.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreMix and match wall decorations for a custom look.Who’s to say novelty signs, mixed-media art and metal wall art don’t belong on the same surface? The key to getting your personalized style right is to pick the pieces that you can’t live without, regardless of their medium or composition. Drawings, paintings, prints and posters have just as much of a right to be together as peanut butter and jelly. That’s not to say that a collection of coordinating photographs can’t look just as stunning, but it’s ultimately your preference that matters.Think beyond the typical home wall decor.Framed photos and pretty pictures are nice, but they aren’t your only option when it comes to decorating bare walls. Consider hanging up a unique rug or an intricate tapestry instead; these are not only visually appealing but add a textural element to your space. Have lots of trinkets and collectibles to display? Mount some attractive wall shelves and arrange them as you see fit. If you don’t want to poke holes through your drywall, try putting up some wallpaper or wall decals, which provide plenty of pizzazz on their own.Browse our wall decor section to find products you’ll love.
