START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.






NEXT



Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

Question 2 of 5





Question 3
If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing

Sell some investments

Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4
How long do you plan to keep your assets invested for?

YEARS


Estimating your time horizon


Your investing goal may be far in the future, or it could be right around the corner. How many years you have to reach your goals will shape your portfolio.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3

Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.






Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3



 


Learn more about why to use ETFs.






 






Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

There can be no guarantee that these strategies and processes will produce the intended results and no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. This could result in the Fund's underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives.

	ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a "buy" or "sell" is executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs. Shares are bought and sold at market price (closing price) not net asset value (NAV) are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the return you would receive if you traded at other times.

	There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment goal. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles, or from social, economic, or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Bonds and bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise.

	Investments in sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations involve special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt or the authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default. Investments in commodities are subject to higher volatility than more traditional investments. The fund may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses. The use of leverage by the fund managers may accelerate the velocity of potential losses. The Fund employs a "momentum" style of investing that emphasizes investing in securities that have had higher recent price performance compared to other securities. This style of investing is subject to the risk that these securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities or that the returns on securities that have previously exhibited price momentum are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. Diversification may not protect against market loss. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume.

	Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Buying and selling shares will result in brokerage commissions. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

	There are special risks associated with margin investing. As with stocks, you may be called upon to deposit additional cash or securities if your account equity declines.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.
Cumulative return is the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time. Annualized return is the average return gained or lost by an investment each year over a given time period. Cambria Funds' NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time.
The closing market price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Since the Fund's Shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns.

SOVB Cambria Sovereign High Yield Bond ETF
The Cambria Sovereign High Yield Bond ETF seeks income and capital appreciation from investments in securities and instruments that provide exposure to sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds. The Cambria Sovereign Bond Index consists of liquid sovereign debt issues with high yield characteristics. The Fund seeks high income generation and capital appreciation and provides exposure to a basket of foreign currencies. Rather than adhering to traditional notions of emerging and developed markets, the strategy seeks the most attractively priced debt securities from a global opportunity set.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.
Cumulative return is the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time. Annualized return is the average return gained or lost by an investment each year over a given time period. Cambria Funds' NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time.
The closing market price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Since the Fund's Shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns.

	The Cambria ETFs are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Company (SIDCO), 1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA 19456, which is not affiliated with Cambria Investment Management, LP, the Investment Adviser for the Fund. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.

To determine if this Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expense before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's full or summary prospectus which may be obtained by calling 855-383-4636 (ETF INFO) or visiting our website at www.cambriafunds.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

	SYLD, GMOM and VAMO are actively managed using proprietary investment strategies and processes. There can be no guarantee that these strategies and processes will produce the intended results and no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. This could result in the Fund's underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives.

	ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a "buy" or "sell" is executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs. Shares are bought and sold at market price (closing price) not net asset value (NAV) are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the return you would receive if you traded at other times.

	There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment goal. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles, or from social, economic, or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Bonds and bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise.

	Investments in sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations involve special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt or the authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default. Investments in commodities are subject to higher volatility than more traditional investments. The fund may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses. The use of leverage by the fund managers may accelerate the velocity of potential losses. The Fund employs a "momentum" style of investing that emphasizes investing in securities that have had higher recent price performance compared to other securities. This style of investing is subject to the risk that these securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities or that the returns on securities that have previously exhibited price momentum are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. Diversification may not protect against market loss. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume.

	Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Buying and selling shares will result in brokerage commissions. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

	There are special risks associated with margin investing. As with stocks, you may be called upon to deposit additional cash or securities if your account equity declines.

Cambria ETF Trust Launches Cambria Core Equity ETF (CCOR)
BY Business Wire — 10:24 AM ET 05/24/2017

 LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      The Cambria ETF Trust and its investment manager, Cambria Investment
      Management, LP, today launched the Cambria Core Equity ETF , which actively manages a diversified portfolio of equities
      and options. CCOR is listed on the NYSE Arca exchange and utilizes a
      combination of several strategies to produce capital appreciation while
      reducing risk exposure across market conditions.
    

      Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the value of the Fund’s
      net assets will be invested in equity securities. CCOR’s underlying
      holdings include high-quality companies across all industries and
      sectors that have prospects for long-term total returns as a result of
      their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase
      dividends over time.
    

      CCOR also sells exchange traded index put and call options to reduce
      volatility and increase return. In addition, CCOR buys index put
      options, which can protect investors from a significant market decline
      that may occur over a short period of time. CCOR also uses proprietary
      models and analysis of historical portfolio profit and loss information
      to identify favorable option trading opportunities, including favorable
      call and put option spreads.
    

David Pursell, the fund’s Senior Portfolio manager, said: "CCOR was
      developed to be a core holding for all types of investors, as the
      strategy seeks to combine the long-term compounding benefits of stocks
      with the goal of improving risk management to minimize portfolio
      drawdowns.”
    

      “The Cambria Core Equity ETF fits in well with the growing lineup of
      innovative ETF solutions for various types of investors, both individual
      and institutional, that Cambria has already launched,” added Meb Faber,
      Cambria’s Chief Investment Officer. CCOR is the 11th fund to
      be launched on the Cambria ETF Trust.

      DISCLOSURE
    

Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors,
      charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information
      can be found in the Funds’ summary and full prospectuses, which may be
      obtained by calling 1-855-ETF-INFO, or by visiting www.cambriafunds.com.
      Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


      ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a “buy” or “sell” is
      executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of
      ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs.
    

      Shares are bought and sold at market price (closing price) not net asset
      value (NAV) are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market price
      returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm
      Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the
      return you would receive if you traded at other times. Buying and
      selling shares will result in brokerage commissions. Brokerage
      commissions will reduce you would receive if you traded at other times.
      Buying and selling shares will result in brokerage commissions.
      Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
    

      There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment goal.
      Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.
    

      There is no guarantee dividends will be paid. Diversification may not
      protect against market loss. An option premium is the dollar price per
      share that an option holder pays the option writer for the option
      privileges.
    

      The Fund is actively managed.
    

      Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their performance from
      an underlying reference asset, such as an index. Derivatives, such as
      put options, are often more volatile than other investments and may
      magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. A small investment in a derivative
      can have a large impact on the performance of the Fund as derivatives
      can result in losses in excess of the amount invested. Options used by
      the Fund to offset its exposure to tail risk or reduce volatility may
      not perform as intended. There can be no assurance that the Fund's put
      option strategy will be effective. The put option strategy may not fully
      protect the Fund against declines in the value of its portfolio
      securities.
    

      Cambria Investment Management, LP serves as an advisor to the Cambria
      ETF Trust. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution
      Co., which is not affiliated with Cambria Investment Management, LP or
      any of its affiliates.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (of between $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.*The ETF/ETP Screener includes many types of Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Exchange-traded products (ETPs). It can include ETPs not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.** Performance data shown is past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Yield and return will vary, therefore you have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  For standard quarterly performance, go to the funds SnapShot page by clicking on the ETF/ETPs symbol.ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments.  ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses.  Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Leveraged and inverse exchange traded products are not designed for buy and hold Investors or investors who do not intend to manage their investment on a daily basis. These products require a Most Aggressive investment objective and an executed Designated Investments Agreement to purchase. These products are for sophisticated investors who understand their risks (including the effect of daily compounding of leveraged investment results), and who intend to actively monitor and manage their investments on a daily basis.For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive, long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation is described in the ETFs prospectus and related documents.

How are Similar Funds determined?

This function provides a list of ETPs that is generated by XTF Marco Polo ("XTF"), a third-party independent research provider. XTF uses a proprietary algorithm to develop a list monthly of potentially similar ETPs based on a number of financial characteristics. The ETP characteristics evaluated by XTF's algorithm include, but are not limited to, geography, investment philosophy, style, market capitalization, credit grade and return correlations. Please note: The list provided may include as "similar" ETFs, ETNs and other ETP products. ETNs are not mutual funds; they are unsecured debt of the issuer. Unlike ETFs, ETNs are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. ETNs may trade at a price significantly different from their indicative value. ETNs can become illiquid; you should be willing and able to hold your notes until maturity. Some ETNs are callable or redeemable by the issuer before their stated maturity date. The tax treatment of ETNs is uncertain and may vary from what is described in the prospectus. The results may also include inverse and/or leveraged ETFs and ETNs, which require a Most Aggressive investment objective and an executed Designated Investments Agreement to purchase. These products are for sophisticated investors. They are not designed for buy-and-hold investors who seek to track an index over a long period of time.
This function provides general educational information on potentially similar ETPs. While this function may be of use to investors in evaluating certain information about ETPs, it should not be considered to include every factor that may be necessary for an investor to make a decision to invest in an ETP. A decision to invest in a particular ETF may be based on a number of factors, including investors' needs, goals, and comfort with risk. Please read the ETP's prospectus, offering circulate or other publicly available investment information before making an investment decision. As with other investments through Fidelity, you must decide for yourself if an investment in a security is consistent with your evaluation of the security, your investment objectives, your risk tolerance, your investment time frame and your financial situation. The information provided is educational in nature and should not be used as the sole basis for an investment decision. By making this information available, Fidelity is not endorsing or guaranteeing the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source.











		ETF/ETP Market Tracker provides a quick snapshot of changes for each asset class and individual ETF/ETPs throughout the trading day*. "Performance" shows change in price; "Volume" displays whether the relative volume is higher or lower than average; and "Net Flows" shows weekly net flows. The size of each box represents the relative change in net assets of the asset class within each category. A larger box indicates a greater change in net assets for the asset class. Click "Get more details on the market" to drill down into distinct and specific areas of the market as well as individual ETF/ETPs.	
These 3 views are updated in the following manner:
Today's Price % Change by Asset Class - Today's intraday price performance percent change for each ETP in each asset class is added together and then divided by the total number of ETPs in each asset class.
Relative Volume by Asset Class - Using the 90-day average of the daily volume for both the market and the security; we divide the security's average volume by the market's total volume to determine the normal percentage of the total volume that comes from each security. Throughout the trading day, we will do a similar calculation, comparing the current volume for that security to the total market volume at that point in the day. The two calculations are compared and if the current day's percentage is greater than the average, the security has higher relative volume than the market.
Prior Day Net Flows as % of Net Assets by Asset Class -  Prior Trading Day's ETP Net Flows are added together for the asset class then divided by the total sum of Net Assets for each asset class.
*Price change and volume are delayed typically 1 to 5 minutes during market open. Market close price change and volume will appear until next market open. 











		Expert Strategies are featured to help educate investors about different investment styles used by research firms and consist of a mix of screens from different providers representing different equity styles and are intended to reflect current market trends. They are typically changed monthly. Fidelity does not endorse or recommend them.
		











		Sabrient selects its ETF Bulls or Bears of the Week using a proprietary methodology that combines Sabrient's Outlook Scores with its Bull or Bear Score.

	ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a "buy" or "sell" is executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs.

Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the return you would receive if you traded at other times.

	There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment goal. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles, or from social, economic, or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Bonds and bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise.

	Investments in sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations involve special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt or the authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default. Investments in commodities are subject to higher volatility than more traditional investments. The fund may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses. The use of leverage by the fund managers may accelerate the velocity of potential losses. The Fund employs a "momentum" style of investing that emphasizes investing in securities that have had higher recent price performance compared to other securities. This style of investing is subject to the risk that these securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities or that the returns on securities that have previously exhibited price momentum are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. Diversification may not protect against market loss. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume.

	Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Buying and selling shares will result in brokerage commissions. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

	There are special risks associated with margin investing. As with stocks, you may be called upon to deposit additional cash or securities if your account equity declines.

Cambria ETF Trust Launches Hedged Multifactor ETF

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cambria ETF Trust and its investment manager, Cambria Investment Management, LP, today launched the Cambria Value and Momentum ETF (Ticker: VAMO). This is the sixth fund in Cambria's suite of ETFs, which has quickly gained over $400 million in assets. 
VAMO, listed on the NYSE Arca exchange, is an actively managed ETF with multifactor and hedging capabilities. VAMO invests in 100 stocks with market caps greater than US $200 million which rank among the highest in value and momentum factors. The Fund then has the ability to hedge up to 100% of the portfolio based on top down objective assessment of stock valuations and market trends. 
VAMO allows the investor to hedge the equity portfolio when the market is expensive or in a downtrend, or both. The Fund will scale the hedges up and down on a weekly basis. At launch, its two largest sectors exposures are financial and consumer discretionary stocks, and the fund is hedged approximately 100%. 
"The recent volatility in the US markets is a classic example of why investors may want to consider hedging their investments," said Meb Faber, Cambria Chief Investment Officer. "Value and momentum have long been important factors when selecting equity investments. Combining these two factors with hedging provides a strong portfolio of companies with the potential to minimize downside losses."
Eric Richardson, Cambria's Chief Executive Officer, added: "As one of the fastest growing issuers of smart-beta ETF strategies, we're pleased to expand our offering of academically-driven funds which meet investors' portfolio needs."

Cambria ETF Trust Launches Global Momentum ETF (GMOM)

Nov 04, 2014, 10:33 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Cambria Investment Management, LP 











 
















































 

 




















 


LOS ANGELES, Nov. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cambria ETF Trust and its investment manager, Cambria Investment Management, LP, today launched the Cambria Global Momentum ETF (Ticker: GMOM), which utilizes a quantitative approach to actively manage a diversified portfolio of world asset classes.  The fund is based on the insight that sorting assets based on trailing measures of momentum and trend has historically led to outperformance.  
GMOM is listed on the NYSE Arca exchange and is comprised of 17 holdings which represent the top 33% of a universe of approximately 50 ETFs. The holdings are selected on measures of trailing momentum and trend. By sorting through a basket of domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and currencies, the strategy targets aggressive returns while still managing risk and volatility.  
In traditional long-only strategies, investors are at risk of exposure to long bear markets. In times of increased volatility and bear cycles, GMOM shifts investors into potentially less volatile assets like cash and bonds when the high momentum ETFs are trading below their long-term trend metrics.
"The Cambria Global Momentum ETF seeks to take advantage of momentum and trend in a systematic way in an attempt to protect investors from emotional decision making," said Mr. Faber. "The fund attempts to achieve better than equity like returns while still having strict risk control methods."
Eric Richardson, Cambria's Chief Executive Officer, added: "GMOM's foundation is based on comprehensive research and a carefully crafted approach of management that capitalizes on Meb Faber's white paper, A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation.  The white paper and the subsequent book The Ivy Portfolio: How to Invest Like the Top Endowments and Avoid Bear Markets show that sorting assets based on trailing measures of momentum and trend has led to outperformance. The new fund fits in well with the suite of innovative strategic-beta ETFs that Cambria has already launched."

Cambria ETF Trust Launches Cambria Core Equity ETF (CCOR)






























LOS ANGELES, May 24, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
The Cambria ETF Trust and its investment manager, Cambria Investment 
      Management, LP, today launched the Cambria Core Equity ETF (nyse 
      arca:CCOR), which actively manages a diversified portfolio of equities 
      and options. CCOR is listed on the NYSE Arca exchange and utilizes a 
      combination of several strategies to produce capital appreciation while 
      reducing risk exposure across market conditions.


                                        








Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the value of the Fund’s 
      net assets will be invested in equity securities. CCOR’s underlying 
      holdings include high-quality companies across all industries and 
      sectors that have prospects for long-term total returns as a result of 
      their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase 
      dividends over time.


                                        








CCOR also sells exchange traded index put and call options to reduce 
      volatility and increase return. In addition, CCOR buys index put 
      options, which can protect investors from a significant market decline 
      that may occur over a short period of time. CCOR also uses proprietary 
      models and analysis of historical portfolio profit and loss information 
      to identify favorable option trading opportunities, including favorable 
      call and put option spreads.


                                        








David Pursell, the fund’s Senior Portfolio manager, said: "CCOR was 
      developed to be a core holding for all types of investors, as the 
      strategy seeks to combine the long-term compounding benefits of stocks 
      with the goal of improving risk management to minimize portfolio 
      drawdowns.”


                                        








“The Cambria Core Equity ETF fits in well with the growing lineup of 
      innovative ETF solutions for various types of investors, both individual 
      and institutional, that Cambria has already launched,” added Meb Faber, 
      Cambria’s Chief Investment Officer. CCOR is the 11
		[th]
	 fund to 
      be launched on the Cambria ETF Trust.

DISCLOSURE


                                        

Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, 
      charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information 
      can be found in the Funds’ summary and full prospectuses, which may be 
      obtained by calling 1-855-ETF-INFO, or by visiting

. 
      Read the prospectus carefully before investing.









ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a “buy” or “sell” is 
      executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of 
      ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs.


                                        








Shares are bought and sold at market price (closing price) not net asset 
      value (NAV) are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market price 
      returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm 
      Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the 
      return you would receive if you traded at other times. Buying and 
      selling shares will result in brokerage commissions. Brokerage

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment goal. 
      Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.


                                        








There is no guarantee dividends will be paid. Diversification may not 
      protect against market loss. An option premium is the dollar price per 
      share that an option holder pays the option writer for the option 
      privileges.


                                        








The Fund is actively managed.


                                        








Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their performance from 
      an underlying reference asset, such as an index. Derivatives, such as 
      put options, are often more volatile than other investments and may 
      magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. A small investment in a derivative 
      can have a large impact on the performance of the Fund as derivatives 
      can result in losses in excess of the amount invested. Options used by 
      the Fund to offset its exposure to tail risk or reduce volatility may 
      not perform as intended. There can be no assurance that the Fund's put 
      option strategy will be effective. The put option strategy may not fully 
      protect the Fund against declines in the value of its portfolio 
      securities.

START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.






NEXT



Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

Question 2 of 5





Question 3
If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing

Sell some investments
Sell everything


Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4

YEARS


Estimating your time horizon


Your investing goal may be far in the future, or it could be right around the corner. How many years you have to reach your goals will shape your portfolio.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3

Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.






Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The strategies discussed are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will be effective.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

Best Online Brokers

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
