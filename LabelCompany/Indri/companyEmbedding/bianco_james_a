Pizzeria Bianco---James Beard Worthy...Forget It..Lets Fight

Jan 20, 2001 01:58 PM






I am a chef and restaurant owner in Seattle. I spent many years as a chef in Scottsdale. I agree that Bianco's pizzeria is pretty good, yet all the gushing makes me sick. I as a chef cannot believe that he was nominated last year for a James Beard award. This award as you know is by region and selects only a handful of nominees. Robert McGrath who is an accomplished, outstanding culinarian was nominated and he has earned it. Bianco is just a talented guy who is a marketing machine. I do not feel that he deserves this many kudos. There are so many chefs that have much more talent than he. Marketing has just put him on top. I cannot recall what other kitchens he was manning before his own. Anyway, I love a good fight and I want to hear all the boo-birds come out of the woodwork or those that agree jump on the bandwagon.Maybe Joe at Pizza Hut will get the prestigious Beard nomination. You would think maybe a Brian Reilly of CREW or some young stud would get the nod.

Restaurant-wise, Phoenix is about the most miserable big city in the United States: expensive, mediocre and and pretentious.  (I will except Allessandro Stratta, whom you will notice fled the area as soon as he was able.) And Bianco uses honest ingredients, is scrupulous about local, organic, sustainable produce, and makes a truly fine product. I think it is admirable that the Beard committee recognizes this instead of nominating yet more of the confused and awful fusion restaurants in which the region seems to specialize. Bianco is beloved by the national chef circuit because they realize he prepares close to the only (non-Mexican) food in the godforsaken region worth eating.

Dear Chowhounds: Whoever deserves the Beard prize, Chef Simpson has accurately taken the culinary temperature of all of Maricopa County. Indeed, the Mexican food of the area is eminently forgettable. Those who know always plan a trip so that they never have to take a meal there.  Motoring, you must breakfast in Tucson, and drive five miles an hour above the speed limit into Yuma for lunch. (I cannot help you going north from Phoenix.) Flying, you must breakfast or lunch shortly before gate time, fly into Phoenix, eat there in the home of known friends, and be gone before the next mealtime. If trapped, you must get to the nearest Picadilly Cafeteria (acceptable but no more), and promise yourself never to make THAT mistake again. Don't eat in the numerous over-priced clip-joints of Maricopa County, including the Arizona Biltmore. You may have a tolerable meal in such places, but you will have been 'taken'. The information I have imparted here has been known to native Tucsonans for more than half-a-century. Do I harbor a deep dislike for Phoenix and its environs? I certainly do, as did my father and mother before me. It is Arizona at its basest, including food, other culture, and supremely POLITICS. Canon Fowler

Dear Chowhounds, Back to the real issue at hand, Pizzeria Bianco serves straight forward, fresh food in a genuine, friendly atmosphere-period.  This is something that is hard to come by in any city.  Let's leave the culinary egos and jealousy at home.

Old topic?  I had to do a doubletake... the original post was from when Clinton was handing Bush the keys to the White House!  Since then, Bianco did get the James Beard award (2003), is as popular as ever, and still cranking out the food on a daily basis.  Gotta give him props for that - and maybe the timing of this was strangely intuitive, for Bianco's will now have been opened during 5 presidential terms, if my math is correct.

You should really get your facts straight before you post something you know nothing about. First of all, Alex did NOT flee this area (to go to Las Vegas). He was made an offer he couldn't refuse, and more power to him. He didn't go looking for it. Steve Wynn came to him. Second of all, as of right now, he IS planning on returning here sometime in the very near future. So, I doubt HE thinks it's as awful an area as you do, if he's coming back to it (or at least considering it)!!!
