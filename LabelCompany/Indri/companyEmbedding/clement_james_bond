It's starting to look like Facebook and YouTube blew a golden opportunity to grab TV ad money this year





Google's been running a secret test to detect bogus ads — and its findings should make the industry nervous




Most people can't imagine James Bond drinking anything other than his signature vodka martini (shaken not stirred). But the international man of mystery is going to be sipping Heineken, again, in the upcoming Bond flick "Skyfall."
While some fans cry "sacrilege," this isn't the first time Bond has strayed from martinis.
In the very first Bond movie, "Dr. No," Bond perched at a bar beside a Red Stripe. He's also imbibed various brands of vodka, sodas, and other prominently labeled beverages.
For "Skyfall," Bond will be seen with a mall full of different brands, covering everything from Coke Zero, to Sony Vaio. The Heineken tie-in is one of the largest product placement packages in history.
To give you a sense of just how big of a deal product placement is for James Bond, we put together a short history of product placement throughout the lifespan of the movie franchise.

Spectre, the longest, most expensive Bond yet, wouldn’t have been made without product placement. There is always a hoo-ha about this sort of thing. The sanctity of Ian Fleming’s character suddenly becomes paramount. His watch is wrong! His car is wrong! He’s also stopped hitting women. He might, one day, be black. 




Spectre review: James Bond is back, stylish, camp and sexily pro-Snowden

Good news for those peeved by 007 drinking a beer in Skyfall, Spectre is subtle in its product placement. Three brands are mentioned by name – two car manufacturers and a gunmaker – and only one is an official sponsor. Bond drinks a vodka martini, but doesn’t ask for it by brand. He doles out champagne, but the label’s left hidden. The close-ups we get of logos are of a restaurant where M (Ralph Fiennes) is eating alone and a scene where he is reading in a newspaper about an escapade in Mexico that’s gone awry. That’s a shot of a copy of the Guardian, on to which M slaps a copy of the Times. Advertising is at play; still, we are a long way from the grand-scale product flog of “Buy Another Day”.

  The film team review Spectre


Daniel Craig, not shy about advertising his feelings on the character and the franchise, has described product placement in the Bond films as “a fact of life”. But, increasingly sponsorship in Bond – at least in the Craig era – has become a fact of the real world, while the fiction is left alone. The use of the actors in selling stuff around the films is brazen and often crass, but it’s allowed Sam Mendes and his writing team to avoid too much out-and-out endorsement in Spectre. It’s a fair trade for fans: let Naomie Harris race around the Southbank in pursuit of a mobile phone on the telly ads, so that the film stays relatively unsullied.
The real world also offers moments of real people rejecting the script. Both Mendes and Craig expressed doubts about the quality of the studio’s choice of mobile phone for the character in Spectre. There’s something delightfully contradictory (and not very suave) about Daniel Craig being paid millions to clotheshorse all this swag, while bitching about it in private. Very off-brand Daniel.

Bond – moneyed, stylish, aspirational – has always been a potent brand for advertisers to associate themselves with. But, with Spectre, it’s almost as if the brand has branched into two: the Bond of the film and the Bond that can be used to sell. It’s a canny strategy, allowing Craig, Mendes and producer Barbara Broccoli to bolster both their artistic credibility and their product placement fees. 
Spectre is cornier than Skyfall, less gripping than Casino Royale. The plot is baggy, the real-world concerns (surveillance and civil liberties) are as throwaway as ever. The film has its problems, but product placement isn’t one of them.

This may come as a shock to some, but movies are expensive to make. Especially big action movies like the James Bond films. That’s why more and more studios are turning to “brand partners” to help get their movies made, as director Morgan Spurlock explored in his recent documentary The Greatest Movie Ever Sold (check out our review and our interview with Spurlock).
But can too much product placement ruin a movie? What happens if corporate brands invest so much money into a film that the filmmaker loses control of the finished product?

No film will answer these questions better than the as-yet-unnamed new James Bond film, Bond 23, which will set new records in product placement spending. According to a new report from The Australian newspaper (via TheFilmStage.com), Bond 23 will get an eye-popping $45 million in funds from product placement agreements. That amount equals one-third of the film’s production budget.
To put that figure in perspective, the film that held the record previously was Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report, which received $20 million from product placement agreements. For the math haters out there, Bond 23 is getting over twice as much money from big brands.
With the exception of one long action sequence that took place in a Lexus factory (and conveniently ended with the construction of a sleek Lexus car for Tom Cruise to drive away in), I recall Minority Report being pretty good about hiding product placement in the context of the story. The more recent Bond films, on the other hand, have fallen into the trap of lingering on brand names in shots and other ostentatious product placement, which can be very distracting to audiences.
I’m a Bond fan, and I’m pleased that Bond 23 is finally going into production after the MGM bankruptcy saga. I’m also very excited to see what director Sam Mendes brings to the venerable franchise. However, I won’t lie and say that the product placement figures don’t bother me.


Aston Martins: A product that has long been placed in Bond movies.


The James Bond franchise is highly recognizable and, thus, is also easily marketable. It’s no wonder that big brands want to be involved in the next film. One has to wonder, however, just how much influence $45 million buys. In a profit-driven town like Hollywood, I’m betting it’s a lot more than Bond fans would like.
What do you think of this news? Is product placement nothing to worry about, or is it risky to receive one-third of your budget from sponsors?

Is product placement out of control?
The tactical advantage is questionable when more than 60 brands can share the screen.


By Mindi Chahal

The number of product placements in this summer’s blockbuster films is set to soar, but the tactical advantage is questionable when more than 60 brands can share the screen. To be successful marketers must ensure the creative is right and exploit additional complementary content.
This summer is set to be full of blockbuster films, with Jurassic World and Entourage already in the cinema and Disney’s Tomorrowland, a new Mission Impossible and a fifth film in the Terminator franchise all due for release. All the films will inevitably be packed with product placements.
Entourage, based on the HBO TV show, features a whopping 65 brands in its 104 minutes running time, according to analysis by Interbrand’s Brandchannel.com. So has product placement gone too far, or is the screen time a brand gets worth the investment? And if it is, then how do brands maximise the impact?
Beyond the money that is handed over in these deals, the associations formed by brands and the authenticity of the placement are also in question, as is the matter of whether the rising popularity of product placement is causing a dip in its credibility as a marketing channel.

Product placement revenues in the US alone are set to grow 13.2% in 2015 from more than $6bn last year, according to PQ Media, although no other market is close to matching it.
Exploiting additional content
Analysis of films Jurassic World and Avengers: Age of Ultron by Amobee Brand Intelligence suggests that product placement can be effective – at least in creating awareness and engagement – particularly when the brand follows up with additional content.

“Some of these projects can start two to three years before the film releases but it can help tell a brand story if done right.”
George Clement, Chevrolet

Its data shows that ‘digital consumption’ increased for brands associated with these films. The measure estimates audience interest based on how much related content is being viewed across the web, mobile, social, and video channels.
The study shows that between May and June, 56% of shaving foam brand Barbasol’s digital consumption was related to Jurassic World, with 39% of it also mentioning the connection to the original 1993 film Jurassic Park, where it previously appeared. Barbasol has also more than doubled its digital footprint in the past month because of the association.
However, Lego is the brand most associated with the film, not because of product placement but because of the Jurassic World toy line it released. Barbasol and Mercedes-Benz, which both did product placements, come second and third.
Amobee’s statistics also show that between March and June, there was nearly five times as much Avengers-related digital consumption for Gillette as Barbasol achieved through Jurassic World. While Gillette’s Fusion Pro-Glide razor appeared in the latest Avengers film briefly, it is fair to assume most of this consumer activity was prompted by its parody press conference, TV ad and YouTube videos suggesting it had designed razors equipped with the same superpowers as the Avengers characters.

The value of shareable content linked with product placement is being realised by some marketers. General Motor’s Chevrolet brand, for example, filmed interviews with people who own its electric car Volt at a pre-screening of the Tomorrowland film in which it appears, hosted on the brand’s YouTube channel.
General Motor’s Cadillac brand also ran a similar behind-the-scenes video with the cast of Entourage and their thoughts on their ‘co-star’ in the film, the Cadillac Ciel.

“Cinemagoers are emotionally engaged and ready to be told stories,” says Karen Stacey, CEO at Digital Cinema Media. “Brands have an unrivalled opportunity to entertain and connect with them and can showcase their best brand stories alongside legendary film-makers and characters.”
Stacey believes there are several trends that are emerging that will get brands noticed in today’s fragmented media landscape. First, using effective advertising; second, building powerful emotional connections; and third, exploiting branded content
(see viewpoint, below).
Making product placements credible
One sector that seems to have realised bigger potential in product placement in the past year is the automotive industry. It is nothing new, of course, as James Bond fans will know, but cars are increasingly integrated into film storylines and the best branded content around films is getting sleeker and smarter, not only drumming up interest in the film but also synchronising with key campaigns for brands.

This year’s releases will see Mercedes race around with dinosaurs in Jurassic World and BMW Minis turn into ghosts from the arcade game Pac Man for Adam Sandler’s new film Pixels – where villains from video games come to destroy earth.
For its tie-in with Tomorrowland, Chevrolet started talking to film-makers in 2013, as the technology and future theme were important to its ‘Find New Roads’ campaign – a concept that was part of the launch of a new global brand positioning.
“It’s great to be able to get in early to work with the film-maker and find that natural connection within the story of the film,” says George Clement, manager of branded entertainment at Chevrolet. “It’s important to get far upstream as you can. Some
of these projects can start two to three years before the film releases but it can help tell a brand story if done right.”
The best branded content around films is getting sleeker and smarter, and is synchronising with key brand campaignsThis does require involvement in the creative process, particularly if the placement is arranged through a partnership model, which the brand prefers. Clement says: “We do have some say in that process but we are also respectful of the creative process.”
Chevrolet has a long history of prominent product placement deals. The Bumblebee character in Transformers is a Chevrolet Camero, for example, while Tomorrowland is also not the first time the brand has teamed up with Disney. The manufacturer’s Corvette, Tahoe, Silverado and Impala models featured in Disney-owned Marvel Studios’ Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
Bridget McCarville, branded entertainment manager at Cadillac, is not worried about the 64 other brands its going up against in the Entourage film because it was “fortunate” that Cadillac already featured with the Escalade model in the HBO series.
“We loved that it took place in Los Angeles as LA has a car culture,” says McCarville. “It was a great backdrop for us to feature.”
She adds: “If you want to play in this space, you have to realise that you are telling your brand story through an intermediary. You have to trust their creative process; you hand it over and put it in the world that they are creating so that the story comes through, it connects and it’s organic.”
An ‘organic’ connection also saw Volkswagen make an appearance in the recent film Pitch Perfect 2, about an American a capella singing group, but the influence over the creative content was limited as the deal was not a paid-for partnership.
Universal approached Volkswagen with an opportunity to provide vehicles for the film and equipment for a scene where a rival German a capella group, called Das Sound Machine, perform at an automotive show.
“There is great exposure for the brand,” says Jennifer Clayton, general manager for marketing at Volkswagen. “When we evaluate these types of partnerships we want to make sure it feels like a good fit, is in line with our tonality and see whether there is an opportunity to do more with it.”
However, she says “there is a fine line you walk” in product placement because there are risks in bombarding consumers with products. “If you force your brand into a movie or piece of content where it doesn’t feel right, consumers nine times out of 10 are going to call you out on that,” she adds.
The film Entourage features 65 brands including CadillacFor Universal, the appeal of the Volkswagen product placement is cost savings on the staging equipment for the auto show scene, vehicles for the film and the flexibility in creative choices as they do not have to treat the brand as a marketing partner because it is not a paid-for deal.
Restrictive TV regulations
The small screen is also getting savvy about the opportunities for brands and TV programming. However, in the UK there are tighter guidelines on what can be done in the TV format than on film, which are set by telecoms regulator Ofcom, including what products can be used, and where and how they can be placed.
Programmes are also required to carry a product placement logo in the form of the letter P, to inform viewers the programme-maker has been paid to include products.
Its value, however, is under scrutiny as only four in 10 adult viewers are aware of product placement in television programmes and only 14% recognise that the ‘P’ symbol indicates product placement, according to a study of 2,074 UK adults by Ofcom.
Product placement in TV is taking a similar road to film, where brands are woven into storylines. ITV, for example, works with brands early in the process to “scope out opportunities on screen” explains Katherine Marlow, senior product placement
and branded content manager at ITV.
She says brands need to “communicate objectives at the earliest stages”, so it can work on finding relevant scenes and environments with production partners.
In the case of its Visa Contactless deal with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, the payments brand briefed ITV in the last quarter of 2014 and the broadcaster was able to agree a deal before filming started in December and transmission in February.
“Under the Ofcom guidelines, all placements have to be editorially justified and cannot be unduly prominent,” says Marlow. “Product placement is the closest a brand can get to [branded TV] content and while the opportunity is hugely exciting, we are always careful about the implementation. Above all, we have to respect the viewers and maintain their trust and engagement.”
Ofcom restrictions would also prevent overcrowding a programme with several brands, so the bun fight between brands on the big screen does not happen on TV in the UK.
However, Marlow adds: “Some shows are big enough to sustain multiple PP deals such as The X Factor, which last year partnered with Skype, Tresemmé and TalkTalk on screen.”
Music is also an increasingly fertile ground for product placement. A report published by The University of Colorado in March found that references to products in lyrics had increased, and that the practice of featuring brands in music videos was becoming more common.
Partnering with Lotus F1 will open up opportunities through TV coverage in emerging markets for Pharrell Williams’s brand I Am OtherAs more artists look to create revenue in alternative ways, considering the state of the music industry and the rise of streaming sites eating into recording revenues, it is no wonder that more brands are paying to place products in songs and videos.

Musicians are also going the other way, placing their own brands into televised entertainment.
“The truth is it’s about patronage rather than placement and finding two brands that work well together,” says Damon Bryant, executive creative director at Lotus F1 Team and partner at agency Bacchus Creative. “Quite often you will get a brand that will want to sign an artist just because they are big, and they have a big song, but you are paying a lot of money for a song to go on your ad campaign or into a feature film.”
He recently worked with singer and producer Pharrell Williams on placing his brand I Am Other, which incorporates the star’s music, film, television, apparel, tech and multimedia, into Formula 1.
Bryant says Pharrell “sees that TV audience and realises how he can push his music through” and also mentions that the star sees the merchandising partnerships, art projects, soundtracks made for the racetrack and opportunities in emerging markets that watch F1, including Azerbaijan, Russia and Mexico. “That is a really exciting place where you are merging the music world, TV and F1,” he adds.
Bryant’s view on films reflects the same preference for “patronage not placement”.
He says: “You have to engage with it in a beautiful way and make it part of the storytelling. We all wear clothes, wear a watch and drink – make it part of the story and that’s how it makes much more sense. The brands have the money, but don’t just slap them in for the sake of it because people get fed up of that.”
Whether it is film, music or TV, brands that want to tap into the respective audiences of these genres will have to respect the creativity of each, come early to the table to work alongside the creative and create the right interplay between the content on the screen and branded content surrounding it.

For brands looking to move into the content space, they need to have an idea that’s pure and original, while also understanding exactly who will watch it, like it and share it.
Advertisers must ensure they are using the right platforms available to them when launching their content.
While content will always be king, brands need to start being braver, bolder and more disruptive with their approach to ensure they are effectively engaging their target audience.
We believe that the rush to branded content that we are seeing today will see advertisers and agencies challenge themselves to make this content ever more cinematic.

We look at which brands sit in our world. It’s being smart about it. Work out the demographic and find the brand that sits in the same world as you do; that way you can lift each other because your audiences are similar.

Consumers are looking for you to place your products in unique spots.
The key is where do we fit in and how does it work. Today’s consumer is savvy so if a brand can help enhance a story, they will appreciate it.

Writers, James Bond, and the Perils of Product Placement








































By David Gaughran For Indiereader.com
It’s one of the most recognizable quotes in the history of cinema: “Shaken, but not stirred.” The phrase perfectly encapsulated the nature of James Bond, and has since become synonymous with the suave British spy.
Its first appearance was in Ian Fleming’s fourth Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever, although Bond himself didn’t utter the words until the sixth outing, Dr. No – half-way through the much-loved series.
The movie franchise did a lot more to immortalize the phrase, and it appeared from the very first installment, Dr. No, and in virtually every Bond movie since (with some notable exceptions).
It’s symbolic of James Bond’s quintessential characteristics – sophistication – which explains why fans have reacted so angrily to reports that he will be trading his martini for a Heineken in the upcoming Skyfall. This isn’t the first time that Bond’s traditions have been tampered with; his usual Aston Martin was swapped for a BMW in Goldeneye (presumably for a large check), which caused a similar backlash.
Critics argue that throughout the Fleming novels, numerous novelizations by other authors, and twenty-two movies (to date) that have featured the spy, there are only a few remaining signifiers that make Bond who he is: his code number (007), his looks and taste for amorous adventures, and his sophistication and sense of style – of which the martini, with its explicit instructions for preparation, is a key part.
I’m sure the anger is compounded by the replacement beverage being something as unsophisticated as beer, and something as universal and generic as Heineken. And I’m also confident that nobody is surprised to hear the release of the movie will be accompanied by a worldwide advertising campaign from Heineken, featuring Bond swilling their lager.
Aside from the much-derided (temporary) switch to BMW, this is hardly the first instance of product or brand placement in Bond movies. Since the very first installment in 1962, Bond movies have featured British Airways, PanAm, Perrier, Finlandia Vodka, Smirnoff, Ford, Omega, Mattel, Calvin Klein, Virgin Atlantic, Revlon, Samsonite, Sony Ericcson, Kodak, and many more.
I’m sure Ian Fleming’s literary estate would defend the practice as monetizing something that was native to Fleming’s writing anyway (he often mentioned brands like Cartier and received no compensation). However, fans would be justified in arguing that mentions of products have become increasingly shameless (with a scene in Casino Royale namedropping Omega attracting particular scorn).
Product placement in movies and television has become so ubiquitous that it has led to widespread parody, faux product placement (the invention of fictional products/brands such as Kwik-E-Mart in The Simpsons), reverse placement (the rebranding of real-life 7/11 stores as Kwik-E-Marts in 2007), and product displacement (where Mercedez-Benz asked the makers of Slumdog Millionaire to remove their iconic logo from scenes featuring their cars in slum settings).
Such product placement isn’t as common in books, but it has a long history. When Jules Verne began serializing Around the Wold in Eighty Days in 1872, transport and shipping companies lobbied to be mentioned (it should be noted that Verne claimed the novel was inspired by a Thomas Cook advertisement in a Parisian newspaper).
However, without a doubt the most shameless literary product placement was in a pulpy detective novel from 1962 called Never Kill A Client by Brett Halliday. The book was part of a long-running (and hugely popular) series featuring private detective Mike Shayne.
In one early scene in Never Kill A Client, Shayne is on the scent of a case and boards a flight to Los Angeles, taking a seat next to a passenger reading another of Brett Halliday’s books. The narrator goes on to say:
“It wasn’t a rare occurrence for Shayne to see some complete stranger reading one of Halliday’s books. With thirty million copies of them sold in soft cover editions, it would have been queerer if you didn’t run into them now and then. And Shayne also knew that She Woke to Darkness had recently been reissued in a new cover and there were probably several hundred thousand copies of it in the hands of readers throughout the country.”
The conversation between Shayne and the passenger about Halliday’s oeuvre continues for another two pages. Such an aside is probably made easier by the fact that Brett Halliday was a pen-name.
The writer, Davis Dresser, was an interesting character who wore an eye-patch since a childhood accident with barbed wire. Aside from a voluminous writing output, he was also a founding member of the Mystery Writers of America, of which his wife, fellow author Helen McCloy, later became the first female president.
There is no doubt that Dresser’s tongue is firmly planted in his cheek in the above, as fun is poked at several of his novels. However, it quite clearly shows the possibilities for advertisers to shoehorn their way into fictional narratives.
The advent of e-books makes such marketing tie-ins a lot more attractive to brands. As any author who has been interviewed for a newspaper will know, a clickable link can make all the difference between a bump in sales and no effect whatsoever.
Publishers (and self-publishers) have been circling the idea of advertising in e-books for some time. Straight advertising can be intrusive and can also provoke a negative reaction (even if advertising in books is nothing new and has long been common in things like travel guides). Product placement is (usually) more subtle, and allows marketers to tap into the emotional connection that people have with the writer’s characters.
The attraction of the idea is obvious. It’s an additional revenue stream, and potentially a very lucrative one. While product placement in novels is unlikely to attract the kind of prices we are seeing in movies (Skyfall is aiming to bring in over $40m in product placement fees), there is no doubt that the biggest selling books could command considerable prices.
For self-publishers, the attraction lies in monetizing free or cheap content. After all, a book could be permanently free if it was subsidized sufficiently by advertising or product placement fees.
However, as the James Bond outcry shows, there are clear dangers here. It seems there is a small step between getting paid for something you are doing anyway (mentioning how much a character loves their Converse), and radically altering the characteristics of your hero, or your plot, to suit a corporate agenda.
David Gaughran is the author of the South American historical adventure A Storm Hits Valparaiso and the short stories If You Go Into The Woods and Transfection as well as the popular self-publishing guide Let’s Get Digital: How To Self-Publish, And Why You Should. Born in Ireland, he now lives in Sweden, but spends most of his time travelling the world, collecting stories.

My children are now old enough to go downstairs and turn on the TV by themselves. It’s an important moment in their lives — and the lives of their parents. The children have the independence of choosing what they watch, and the parents have the opportunity to stay in bed on a weekend morning. This developmental stage has been in place for decades and, I confess, it’s one I secretly looked forward to.
And yet just 10 minutes into their morning viewing on a recent Saturday, my children shouted in annoyance. They rousted me from bed, complaining that something was wrong with the TV. Through the frenetic complaints, I eventually realized that their program had been interrupted by ads.
This was a new experience for them. They were used to watching on demand or recorded programs. Trying to explain to my children that there are advertising breaks so people can sell them things was a deflating experience. I have since learned that I am not alone in this experience, but that did not help me at the time.
Their incomprehension was total. My argument, that ads are a minor but necessary annoyance, was hardly persuasive. While many have theorized about the decline of interruption-based advertising, I realized as I looked into my children’s faces that the end may be sooner than advertisers realize.
This is a fundamental shift not only for the TV channels, which will have to completely rethink their revenue model, but also for brands, which find it incredibly, and increasingly, difficult to capture the attention of empowered, impatient consumers.
An obvious solution is product placement, a company paying for its product to be featured prominently in a film or television program as a form of advertising. According to PQMedia, the U.S. product placement market grew by 12.8% in 2014, to over $6 billion, and is set to reach over $11 billion by 2019.
The trouble is that the huge success of product placement is causing a dip in its credibility and effectiveness as a marketing channel. Audiences are increasingly skeptical. Research by Eva A. van Reijmersdal of the University of Amsterdam suggests that when product placement becomes too prominent, it affects attitudes negatively because viewers become aware of a deliberate selling attempt. Product placement can also lower audiences’ evaluations of the focal entertainment product (the film or the show), as recently demonstrated by Andre Marchand and colleagues. And it’s particularly true when audiences like the film or show.
This leaves marketers scratching their heads. If interruption-based advertising is no longer an option, and if traditional product placement is no longer the answer, how can brands reach consumers while not offending their sense of empowerment and leveraging their desire for immediate gratification?
I have looked at brand-to-consumer interactions for the last 15 years, and it is obvious that consumers are becoming more impatient, more demanding, and more marketing-savvy than ever before. My research on product placement suggests two new routes that could leverage the evolution in consumer behavior.
The first is interactive product placement, which is technology-driven and leverages the consumer desire for immediacy and relevance while watching a TV show. The second is reverse product placement, an innovative way of launching new brands that can protect the integrity of the show and respect the empowerment of the imaginative consumer.
Interactive product placement. The increasing ubiquity of digital communications technologies and the maturation of interactive video technologies mean that product placement could evolve from a simple promotional tool to a selling tool.
Video technology now allows certain objects, such as products, to be “clickable” within the video. (This sometimes involves actual clicking, such as when you’re watching a video on your laptop, mobile device, or smart TV. It could also involve holding your phone’s camera up to a large screen and scanning an image of the thing being shown.) These interactive technologies allow the viewer to get more information on — or even buy — those brands. If, say, James Bond is wearing a shirt you like, you will be able to buy it immediately.







This will have a significant impact on the design of future product and brand placement campaigns. In addition to introducing a heretofore unknown flexibility to the design and timing of campaigns, these technologies allow product placement campaigns to be targeted, monitored, and measured in real time, as with other forms of internet advertising.
Reverse product placement. A number of fictional brands have been created in order to protect the integrity of the host show. “Red Apple” cigarettes are a fictional brand of tobacco used by Quentin Tarantino in films such as Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Four Rooms. Tarantino seeks to minimize relying on corporate sponsorship and to affirm the nonconformist nature of his movies. The fictional brand conveys a “cool” image, as it is associated with the characters and atmosphere of Tarantino’s movies. It cannot be purchased nor consumed — at least not as cigarettes — though the (fake) vintage ad here can be.
If these fictional brands possess brand equity, is it possible to turn that equity into revenue? The question is moot, because it is already happening — and more regularly than you may think. In 2012 Staples Inc., under license from NBC’s parent company, Comcast, began to manufacture paper using the “Dunder Mifflin” brand name — the fictional paper company in the TV show The Office. Avion Tequila, from the hit HBO show Entourage, has also been “defictionalized” and is now available as a real product in some of New York’s trendiest bars.
There’s no reason to think other brands won’t follow suit, either licensing popular fictional brands from their creators or using popular shows to gauge consumer interest in their own forthcoming or proposed products. Fictional brands can be a method of protecting the integrity of the host show and introducing new brands, but they also can provide an additional stream of revenue to the TV series and film producers seeking to make money in an era when interruptive advertising is dying.
Reverse and interactive product placement could revolutionize the advertising industry. Both of those techniques further blur the lines between entertainment and advertisement, and will accelerate the demise of interruption-based advertising — much to the delight of our children.

Despite saying he’d rather “slash my wrists” than play the world-famous spy/“misogynist” in any future installments, “Spectre” star Daniel Craig cared enough about the character to turn down a $5 million product placement deal to promote Sony’s mobile tech.
According to emails from October 2014 leaked in the Sony hack, Craig and director Sam Mendes scoffed at the idea of 007 using such a sub-standard product.
“BEYOND the $$ factor, there is, as you may know, a CREATIVE factor whereby Sam and Daniel don’t like the Sony phone for the film (the thinking, subjectively/objectively is that James Bond only uses the ‘best,’ and in their minds, the Sony phone is not the ‘best’),” the email from a Columbia Pictures exec read.
God forbid Bond use Android.
So will you be watching “Spectre” to see which phone got the James Bond stamp of approval? Or are you a Sony Xperia Z4 devotee ready to boycott the movie altogether?
