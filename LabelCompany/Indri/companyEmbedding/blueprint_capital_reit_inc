Company - Blueprint Capital

Company - Blueprint Capital














































OUR HISTORY
Blueprint was founded in 2009 by Seattle real estate veterans Mark Knoll and Dan Duffus to help local builders develop and finance small-scale residential housing. The simple idea was to create a better lending model—along with a technology platform and trusted brand—to serve the Seattle market.
The first (and obvious) part of our thesis was clear: That community banks have significant challenges lending to small-scale builders due in large part to new constraints under Dodd-Frank legislation and stricter FDIC regulations—a trend that is likely to continue. The second part of our thesis was that helping local builders with more than just financing would produce better results for them as well as our investors.  This new “value-added” approach, applied to the entire project lifecycle, is the differentiating feature of Blueprint.
Building on our early success, we converted the company to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in 2013 to facilitate loan growth and develop rental property for our portfolio. Today, we are proud to have become Seattle’s leading REIT with the lowest loan default rate (zero) among our peer banking competitors.






Our market
Seattle is one of the most active real estate markets in the country. It provides key requirements for housing demand such as strong population, job and income growth. Within the Seattle market, we focus on urban “in-fill” development rather than suburban “tract” development. Urban housing is in high demand and more resilient to market cycles. And, recycling land in established neighborhoods reduces suburban sprawl—a much more environmentally-sustainable solution to growth.



Urban “In-Fill” Development




Urban “In-Fill” Development





Suburban “Tract” Development









Full-cycle  support


OUR SERVICES
In-fill development is dominated by small-scale, local builders. Blueprint’s innovative lending model serves this market by combining construction financing—which by itself is a commodity product—with value-added development services for an end-to-end builder solution.
Specifically, we support our customers through all four phases of the project lifecycle:  Blueprint sources projects through our agent referral network, provides competitive financing, completes the plans and permits and helps market the project during construction. This integrated, co-operative approach increases builder productivity and, in turn, reduces risk for our shareholders.







OUR REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS
In addition to lending, Blueprint develops residential income property for its portfolio. Our relationship network produces many excellent opportunities for “build and hold” projects in the same urban in-fill neighborhoods that are close to transit, shopping and entertainment. Currently, we are focusing on studio apartment homes that are affordable for residents making 60-80% of the median area income. Key drivers for acquiring rental real estate are:  Income diversity, capital appreciation and building a rental infrastructure in the event that we acquire and hold real estate through a loan foreclosure.
 








our  shareholders
Blueprint is owned by a large and diverse group of individual shareholders made up of our builder customers, management and individuals who value community investing. Our shareholders invest in the thriving Seattle real estate market through the leading real estate investment trust.

BUILDING SMART, SUSTAINABLE NEW HOMES

Blueprint only finances projects in Seattle area neighborhoods because part of our core philosophy is to invest in what we know best. Our experience, comfort and success is with smaller-scale, infill projects. We also feel strongly about investing in projects that are compatible with the neighborhood as well as eco-friendly.


In-fill development makes sense because recycled land saves open space and provides an intelligent alternative to suburban sprawl. And, throughout the process, our customers strive to build sustainably because what’s good for the earth is also good for people. Environmentally-conscious building practices create healthier, more energy-efficient homes.

OUR HISTORY
Blueprint was founded in 2009 by Seattle real estate veterans Mark Knoll and Dan Duffus to help local builders develop and finance small-scale residential housing. The simple idea was to create a better lending model—along with a technology platform and trusted brand—to serve the Seattle market.
The first (and obvious) part of our thesis was clear: That community banks have significant challenges lending to small-scale builders due in large part to new constraints under Dodd-Frank legislation and stricter FDIC regulations—a trend that is likely to continue. The second part of our thesis was that helping local builders with more than just financing would produce better results for them as well as our investors.  This new “value-added” approach, applied to the entire project lifecycle, is the differentiating feature of Blueprint.
Building on our early success, we converted the company to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in 2013 to facilitate loan growth and develop rental property for our portfolio. Today, we are proud to have become Seattle’s leading REIT with the lowest loan default rate (zero) among our peer banking competitors.






Our market
Seattle is one of the most active real estate markets in the country. It provides key requirements for housing demand such as strong population, job and income growth. Within the Seattle market, we focus on urban “in-fill” development rather than suburban “tract” development. Urban housing is in high demand and more resilient to market cycles. And, recycling land in established neighborhoods reduces suburban sprawl—a much more environmentally-sustainable solution to growth.



Urban “In-Fill” Development

Suburban “Tract” Development









Full-cycle  support


OUR SERVICES
In-fill development is dominated by small-scale, local builders. Blueprint’s innovative lending model serves this market by combining construction financing—which by itself is a commodity product—with value-added development services for an end-to-end builder solution.
Specifically, we support our customers through all four phases of the project lifecycle:  Blueprint sources projects through our agent referral network, provides competitive financing, completes the plans and permits and helps market the project during construction. This integrated, co-operative approach increases builder productivity and, in turn, reduces risk for our shareholders.







OUR REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS
In addition to lending, Blueprint develops residential income property for its portfolio. Our relationship network produces many excellent opportunities for “build and hold” projects in the same urban in-fill neighborhoods that are close to transit, shopping and entertainment. Currently, we are focusing on studio apartment homes that are affordable for residents making 60-80% of the median area income. Key drivers for acquiring rental real estate are:  Income diversity, capital appreciation and building a rental infrastructure in the event that we acquire and hold real estate through a loan foreclosure.
 








our  shareholders
Blueprint is owned by a large and diverse group of individual shareholders made up of our builder customers, management and individuals who value community investing. Our shareholders invest in the thriving Seattle real estate market through the leading real estate investment trust.
