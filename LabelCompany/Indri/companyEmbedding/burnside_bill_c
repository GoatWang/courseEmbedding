Burnside's NCS team also included the minor characters of DC Pete Moss, played by John White, and DC Chris Gibson, played by Paul Gilmore.[2] In addition, several recurring characters appeared throughout the series: Paul Nicholas played Ronnie "The Razor" Buchan, a former London gangster and Burnside's nemesis. Tony Selby played Jim Summers, the father of Dave Summers and Burnside's former boss. Shane Richie played Burnside's regular informant, Tony Shotton.

After taking up a position with NCS, Burnside attempts to use his new found-status to collect information on Ronnie Buchan, an old-time adversary who was acquitted of shooting Burnside's friend and police partner Barry. However, upon his arrival, he is caught up in the midst of ongoing operation Gasgoyne, whilst also trying to identify who is responsible for an influx of guns and weaponry on the south coast. Choosing to ignore Supt. Brian Lee, Burnside and his new comrades Dave Sumers and Sam Phillips go on the hunt for Billy Holden, a small-time arms dealer suspected of being the importer of a new wave of high-powered guns. And when his best mate, Renfrew, decides to let his son one of Holden's guns, all hell breaks loose resulting the death of eight teenagers. Determined to catch Holden in the act, making a deal with local gangster mob The Yardies, Burnside sets up his own covert operation to nail Holden before any further disasters.

A serial killer who strangles his female victims with a tie before shaving their pubic hair off is once again prime priority after the death of a fifteen-year-old school girl. Initially, her on-off boyfriend Jerry Forbes is suspected of the murders, having attended football matches in the locations on the days of the murders. However, Sam Phillips is not convinced, and determined to run with her own line of enquiry, decides to tackle local photographer Dave Evans, who despite his 'limp dick' seems the most likely suspect in her eyes. However, her intimacy with Dave, including allowing him to shave her, lands Sam in deep water with both Burnside and Supt. Lee. Not convinced that Evans is entirely concrete, Burnside pressures Sumers to continue with the Forbes angle. However, a reconstruction of the young girl's murder proves the turning point, which points fresh evidence towards Evans. But is Sam in too deep? And will her final sacrifice put her in danger?

When the trial of Dave Vickers sees him acquitted of murder, Burnside's informant Tony Shotton is forced to relocate himself to a quiet country retreat before Vickers and his mob catch up with him. Meanwhile, still on Vickers' trail, Burnside attempts to infiltrate Vickers' upcoming money laundering scam by taking out his lawyer and putting Sumers undercover in his place. However, little does Sumers know that somebody very close to home is leaking information to Vickers and his mob, which soon leads to the murder of Tony Shotton. Hellbent on getting revenge, Burnside decides to make Vickers' deal go tits up by setting fire to £100 million pounds that Vickers has stashed away ready to launder for the Russian Mafia. And when the mafia arrive in London looking for their dough, Burnside decides to give Vickers a do or die ultimatum - give himself up and spend time in jail, or let himself free to the mercy of the Russians. Meanwhile, old foe Ronnie Buchan resurfaces, and Burnside sees his chance to finally nail his arch enemy.

Background[edit]
The lead character of the series was Detective Chief Inspector Frank Burnside, who had appeared in The Bill almost from its inception. Burnside disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 1993 and returned briefly five years later, when it was revealed that he had been working undercover.[1] The main secondary characters were Detective Sergeant Dave Summers and Detective Constable Sam Phillips. Burnside's NCS team also included the minor characters of DC Pete Moss, played by John White, and DC Chris Gibson, played by Paul Gilmore.[2] In addition, several recurring characters appeared throughout the series: Paul Nicholas played Ronnie "The Razor" Buchan, a former London gangster and Burnside's nemesis. Tony Selby played Jim Summers, the father of Dave Summers and Burnside's former boss. Shane Richie played Burnside's regular informant, Tony Shotton.

After taking up a position with NCS, Burnside attempts to use his new found-status to collect information on Ronnie Buchan, an old-time adversary who was acquitted of shooting Burnside's friend and police partner Barry. However, upon his arrival, he is caught up in the midst of ongoing operation Gasgoyne, whilst also trying to identify who is responsible for an influx of guns and weaponry on the south coast. Choosing to ignore Supt. Brian Lee, Burnside and his new comrades Dave Sumers and Sam Phillips go on the hunt for Billy Holden, a small-time arms dealer suspected of being the importer of a new wave of high-powered guns. And when his best mate, Renfrew, decides to let his son one of Holden's guns, all hell breaks loose resulting the death of eight teenagers. Determined to catch Holden in the act, making a deal with local gangster mob The Yardies, Burnside sets up his own covert operation to nail Holden before any further disasters. Or is he already too late?

A serial killer who strangles his female victims with a tie before shaving their pubic hair off is once again prime priority after the death of a fifteen-year-old school girl. Initially, her on-off boyfriend Jerry Forbes is suspected of the murders, having attended football matches in the locations on the days of the murders. However, Sam Phillips is not convinced, and determined to run with her own line of enquiry, decides to tackle local photographer Dave Evans, who despite his 'limp dick' seems the most likely suspect in her eyes. However, her intimacy with Dave, including allowing him to shave her, lands Sam in deep water with both Burnside and Supt. Lee. Not convinced that Evans is entirely concrete, Burnside pressures Sumers to continue with the Forbes angle. However, a reconstruction of the young girl's murder proves the turning point, which points fresh evidence towards Evans. But is Sam in too deep? And will her final sacrifice put her in danger?

When the trial of Dave Vickers sees him acquitted of murder, Burnside's informant Tony Shotton is forced to relocate himself to a quiet country retreat before Vickers and his mob catch up with him. Meanwhile, still on Vickers' trail, Burnside attempts to infiltrate Vickers' upcoming money laundering scam by taking out his lawyer and putting Sumers undercover in his place. However, little does Sumers know that somebody very close to home is leaking information to Vickers and his mob, which soon leads to the murder of Tony Shotton. Hellbent on getting revenge, Burnside decides to make Vickers' deal go tits up by setting fire to £100 million pounds that Vickers has stashed away ready to launder for the Russian Mafia. And when the mafia arrive in London looking for their dough, Burnside decides to give Vickers a do or die ultimatum - give himself up and spend time in jail, or let himself free to the mercy of the Russians. Meanwhile, old foe Ronnie Buchan resurfaces, and Burnside sees his chance to finally nail his arch enemy.
