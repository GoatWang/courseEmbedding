INTERVIEW: Rodney C. Adkins, IBM's futurist
Multiplatform systems will proliferate

Jul 20, 2000

Rodney C. Adkins
Rodney C. Adkins, IBM Corp.'s general manager for Web servers, has spent his entire career with Big Blue.In 1981 he joined IBM as an engineer after completing his second bachelor's degree.After a short break for graduate school, he worked in product development, business operations and general management, and eventually became IBM's vice president of development for commercial desktop computers.In 1996, Adkins was named general manager of commercial desktop systems in IBM's personal systems group. In 1998, he took over his current post, in which he manages the Unix workstation and server product lines of IBM's enterprise systems group.Within IBM, Adkins serves on the worldwide management committee and the board of governors of the IBM Academy of Technology. He is also co-chairman of IBM's Multicultural People in Technology initiative. Adkins has a bachelor's degree in physics from Rollins College.He received a second bachelor's and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology.GCN associate editor Patricia Daukantas interviewed Adkins by telephone.












GCN:'What lines of servers and workstations fall under your purview?


ADKINS: As part of our Web server business unit, we focus on Unix products that range from workstations all the way up to large-scale supercomputers. The brands are called RS/6000 and NUMA-Q.



NUMA-Q is a brand that we added to our portfolio last September when we merged with Sequent [Computer Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.].



GCN:'IBM Corp. is working on a couple of the Energy Department's Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative supercomputers, ASCI Blue Pacific and ASCI White. What other big RS/6000 installations are there within the government?


ADKINS: Oak Ridge National Laboratory recently upgraded theirs. The National Weather Service has a big machine that's looking at climate control [

GCN, Feb. 21, Page 33
]. The National Center for Atmospheric Research has another, and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center is another example.



GCN:'Are the RS/6000 machines mainly for scientific computing, or are agencies using them for data warehousing or hosting large Web sites?


ADKINS: The most visible application is clearly in the scientific and technical computing area, but we have a number of government personnel who are using the machines for typical business purposes. That would include databases, business intelligence and other commercial applications.



Given the size of many of these machines, the scientific and technical uses tend to get a lot more of the visibility. 



GCN:'Are there any practical limitations on RS/6000 multiprocessing?


ADKINS: With any technology, you approach a point where potentially you're dealing with physical barriers. But the design and the architecture of our offerings pretty much provide what I would describe as unlimited scalability.



IBM has eight research labs around the world that look at advanced technologies and high-performance computing techniques. As best as most of our top scientists can tell, there is considerable leeway before we have to worry about hitting some theoretical limit in terms of the scalability of the processors or interconnect technology or even the software.



GCN:'In the relatively near term, won't you bump up against the limits of fabrication'making  spacing between transistors any smaller?


ADKINS: We've been looking at that for a number of years, and every time we get to that point, there's always some technology breakthrough.



We did two innovative things related to processors and fabrication technology. Last year we introduced copper as part of our microprocessor technology road map [

GCN, May 8, Page 36
]. We also came up with something called silicon on insulator [SOI], which insulates transistors on a chip to reduce power leakage and improve performance [

GCN, July 3, Page 38
].



This leads into a set of offerings that we will announce in the second half of 2001 and the first half of 2002, called Power IV. In that architecture, we're taking the IBM innovations like copper and SOI and adding high-speed, high-performance capabilities.



GCN:'You mentioned the acquisition of Sequent last year. What is IBM doing with the NUMA-Q technology that you got from Sequent?


ADKINS: We're doing two things with Sequent. One, as part of the acquisition, we picked up a new class of server offerings. The best way to describe them is as large servers that can start off with a building block. Through interconnection technology you can make a small server a bigger server just by adding a number of building blocks. That's what nonuniform memory access technology is about. It lets you scale from a small symmetric multiprocessing server to a larger SMP server while maintaining the same programming model.



We will extend that across all our Unix servers, from entry to midrange and large-scale. That will give us capabilities across the entire product line with the ability to interconnect a number of servers and make them look like one big server.
