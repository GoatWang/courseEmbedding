Our Products












Our Certified Organic broth is handcrafted the same way it has been for centuries: in small batches.
We start by using triple filtered water. Adding Pastured, organic chicken bones -including the feet-which are particularly rich in gelatin. For our beef broth we use Certified Organic Grass-Fed beef bones. We add organic onions, organic fresh garlic, Celtic Sea Salt® by Selina Naturally® and Organic apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar acts as a magnet to help pull the vitamins and minerals from the bones and into the broth. We then bring the broth to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer. This slow simmer continues on for 24 hours for our chicken broth and 48 hours for our beef broth.
An hour before the broth is ready we add fresh organic parsley to pull any remaining minerals from the bones.
The broth is then coarsely filtered and immediately cooled, packaged in our BPA and EA free bags and then immediately frozen to preserve freshness.

“When I heard about bone broth I was really nervous to try it and was not going to spend 24 hours making it myself. I saw this beef broth on the Instagram I follow and picked it up at my local Sprouts. I heated it up and added some lime juice and salt and it was so tasty! I've been drinking it nightly now for a couple weeks and have noticed I sleep better when I drink it before bed. I have just been sipping it but plan to start cooking with it as too.”

The BEST tasting!

“I tried a few other bone broths but fortunately my first foray into drinking bone broth was Bonafide Provisions that I found on sale at my local health food store. Because it was sooo delicious! Other brands might've turned me off for ever or maybe you guys just spoiled me and I know how good it should taste! It needs nothing added and is wonderful for breakfast or a bedtime snack. Well done!”

Bonafide Provisions LLC


        Bonafide Provisions was founded in 2011 when Sharon Brown, a clinical nutritionist and certified GAPS practitioner, noticed a reluctance from her patients to make their own bone broth. Having walked over 500 clients through the GAPS program, she knew the benefits of this amazing elixir. Her passion for healing and nutrition coupled with a desire to see a shift towards a more nutrient-dense diet is what set the ground for Real Bone Broth, now, Bonafide Provisions. Sharon approached her husband, a professional trained chef and her niece, a nutritional therapist and CrossFit coach, and together they created Bonafide Provisions.

They believe in maintaining the time honored tradition of the slow cooked, handcrafted, small batch, broth to ensure every batch is the highest quality.

Our broth was the first USDA Organic broth available on the market. The ingredients are meticulously chosen and we pay special attention to organic, local, and sustainable ingredients. Our broth is not shelf stable. We adhere to the time honored tradition of freezing the broth after it is prepared to maintain the integrity of the product.

Our Products












Our Certified Organic broth is handcrafted the same way it has been for centuries: in small batches.
We start by using triple filtered water. Adding Pastured, organic chicken bones -including the feet-which are particularly rich in gelatin. For our beef broth we use Certified Organic Grass-Fed beef bones. We add organic onions, organic fresh garlic, Celtic Sea Salt® by Selina Naturally® and Organic apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar acts as a magnet to help pull the vitamins and minerals from the bones and into the broth. We then bring the broth to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer. This slow simmer continues on for 24 hours for our chicken broth and 48 hours for our beef broth.
An hour before the broth is ready we add fresh organic parsley to pull any remaining minerals from the bones.
The broth is then coarsely filtered and immediately cooled, packaged in our BPA and EA free bags and then immediately frozen to preserve freshness.

Bonafide Provisions LLC


        Bonafide Provisions was founded in 2011 when Sharon Brown, a clinical nutritionist and certified GAPS practitioner, noticed a reluctance from her patients to make their own bone broth. Having walked over 500 clients through the GAPS program, she knew the benefits of this amazing elixir. Her passion for healing and nutrition coupled with a desire to see a shift towards a more nutrient-dense diet is what set the ground for Real Bone Broth, now, Bonafide Provisions. Sharon approached her husband, a professional trained chef and her niece, a nutritional therapist and CrossFit coach, and together they created Bonafide Provisions.

They believe in maintaining the time honored tradition of the slow cooked, handcrafted, small batch, broth to ensure every batch is the highest quality.

Our broth was the first USDA Organic broth available on the market. The ingredients are meticulously chosen and we pay special attention to organic, local, and sustainable ingredients. Our broth is not shelf stable. We adhere to the time honored tradition of freezing the broth after it is prepared to maintain the integrity of the product.

Review: Bonafide Provisions’ Drinkable Veggies Marries Both Broth and Drinkable Soup

            Posted: Mar 07, 2017 at 6:17 PM (Last Updated: Mar 08, 2017 at 9:43 AM)
            



Covers Products: Thrive, Revitalize, Revive, Glow, Renew

If you read our site on even an irregular basis, you’ll know that we frequently cover both drinkable soup and bone broth. There are significant contrasts between these two concepts, with drinkable soup largely a vegetable based vegan product and bone broth not much more than meat-based stock. With this new product offering, Bonafide Provisions seems to be trying to marry the two. Drinkable Veggies Bone Broth, which is USDA Organic certified, contains chicken broth at the base of each savory flavor. From there, they’ve added vegetables, salt, spices, and vinegar (apple cider vinegar and white vinegar) to create each individual formulation. We’d describe the flavors as more savory and flavorful than either bone broth or drinkable soup.For this review, we sampled five flavors: Glow (tomato, beet, cucumber), Revive (carrot, fennel, turmeric), Thrive (squash, onion, turmeric), Renew (red pepper and tomato), and Revitalize (peas, asparagus, spinach, lemon, and mint). Hearing just the names, you definitely won’t have a sense of what the actual flavors are. One note about tasting these savory products: we found them to be much more enjoyable as they approached room temperature. The experience just isn’t the same when they are chilled.Our favorites of the bunch were Thrive, which has an incredible umami flavor, Revive, which has a bright carrot flavor, and Revitalize, which is loaded with fresh pea flavor. But even the other two, Glow and Renew, are quite tasty, although we feel as though they could use a bit more “pop.”Taking a look at the outside, Bonafide Provisions has created something that looks and feels like a super premium product. Using cleanly executed illustrated graphics, the product has visual appeal thanks to the clean arrangement on the label and its use of a single accent color for each product. While it definitely has some visual appeal, we feel as though the messaging that the product uses needs some work. First and foremost, the juxtaposition of placing “drinkable veggies” on top of “bone broth” in different fonts isn’t the most intuitive way to communicate what the product is. When we first saw it, we were immediately wondering if this was a “veggie bone broth” or simply a vegetable drink. Remedying this would be a huge help. Second, the use of functional words, such as “Renew” or “Thrive” seems meaningless in the context of bone broth or drinkable soup. We feel as though this space could be better used for some sort of flavor name that helps the consumer understand what’s inside the bottle. Overall, Bonafide Provisions has created some really nice innovation with this product line. The nexus of drinkable soup and bone broth is something that works quite well and, after seeing and tasting what they’ve created, feels like it might have larger potential than either concept does by itself.

Chapter: Pacific SouthwestProcessor/HandlerSimply put, our bone broth is real bone broth. We use the old world, traditional method of cooking the bones for 24 hours and use organic apple cider vinegar to pull the vitamins and minerals form the bones into the stock. We immediately cool the broth, freeze it, and make sure that no plastic utensils are used to prevent chemical leeching.
