In 2010, Kempner hosted a $30,400/plate Democratic Party fundraising dinner attended by President Obama at his home in Cresskill, New Jersey.[4][16][17]
In December 2010, President Obama appointed Kempner a member of the White House Council for Community Solutions, a council that works to "reengage disenfranchised youth."[7][18]
In September 2012, he was listed by the New York Times as one of the top "bundlers" for Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, having raised $3 million in 2011 and through May 2012.[19]
In 2013, Kempner donated $50,000 to Organizing for Action.[5] In January 2014, President Obama nominated Kempner to the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees federally controlled outlets that operate overseas.[20] Kempner took office in December of that year.[21]

MWW Group - Michael Kempner






Company: MWW Group, East Rutherford, NJ   Company Description: MWW Group is a full-service public  relations and marketing communications firm known for its results-driven  approach to public relations and "Aim High. Deliver." philosophy. MWW  Group has been named Agency of the Year by The Holmes Report and Midsize Agency  of the Year by PR News.   Nomination Category: Corporate Communications, Investor  Relations, & Public Relations Categories   Nomination Sub Category: Communications, Investor Relations,  or PR Executive of the Year
Nomination Title: Michael W. Kempner - President/CEO of MWW  Group
Tell the story about what this nominee achieved since  January 1 2008 (up to 500 words). Focus on specific accomplishments, and relate  these accomplishments to past performance or industry norms. Be sure to mention  obstacles overcome, innovations or discoveries made, and outcomes:
Michael Kempner, president and CEO of MWW Group, has always  been an innovator    and public relations pioneer. He began MWW in 1986 and has  since led the firm    to become one of the fastest growing in the industry.   His efforts for his    company are only exceeded by the efforts to the communities  in which he    operates, and the world at large.  MWW Group’s commitment to corporate social    responsibility and corporate citizenship comes straight from  Kempner’s heart    and has spread throughout his organization.
Since its founding, Kempner has lead the firm to  year-over-year consecutive    growth and been dedicated to continuing this effort by  delivering outstanding    results for MWW Group’s clients in 2008. As a result of  Kempner’s drive and    pioneering PR practices, MWW Group experienced 7% organic  growth and 4% new    business growth in 2008, arguably the most difficult year  businesses have seen    in a long while.     New 2008 clients included Target, Adecco, Harrah’s, Gold’s    Gym, JetBlue Airways, The Hershey Company, Johnson &  Johnson, and American    Water Works.   In the  case of Target, Adecco, JetBlue and The Hershey Company,    MWW Group rose to the top amongst some of the biggest  multinational PR    consultancies in the world.
Kempner’s commitment to the community is reflected in the  work MWW Group and    its employees do for organizations each year.  In 2008, Kempner worked with    colleagues to focus on the company’s commitment to hunger,  children and the    environment resulting in working with America’s Harvest and  Community Food    Banks; pro-bono initiatives for Keep A Child Alive (KCA), a  group dedicated to    providing food and medicine to AIDS orphans in Africa; the  formalization    of “MWW Group Green” incorporating environmental  responsibility into every    aspect of our business and a commitment to gain ISO 14001  certification (only    the second PR firm in the nation to do so).  Kempner also issued the company’s    first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2008.   In addition to his visionary work    at MWW Group, Mr. Kempner is a board member of Center for  Food Action and North    Jersey Community Bank and was on the chair committee of the  2008 Black Ball to    benefit KCA.
Kempner is a leader in the digital media arena.  DialogueMedia, MWW Group’s    award winning, digital and emerging media practice is  recognized for its    industry leading campaigns and strategic expertise in  digital and emerging    media. Kempner also authors thought-leader content via a  personal blog, Twitter    and Facebook.
Kempner has also inspired employees by personally mentoring  employees and    promoting growth from within, MWW's staff retention rate is  85%. Many members    of our senior staff have been with the company for over ten  years partly    because of the fostering of creativity and talent guided by  Kempner.        Kempner’s vision and commitment has resulted in numerous  industry awards.  In    2008, MWW Group was named PR Agency of the Year (American  Business Awards),    Midsize PR Firm of the Year (PR News) and Kempner was named  the PR Professional    of the Year (PRWeek). In addition, our Financial Relations  Board division was    awarded a Silver Anvil, public relations’ highest honor.
