Make a statement this AW17 in the Elif dress. Adorned in a floral print, this classic wrap style elegantly ties at the waist for a figure-cinching fit. Easy-wearing yet equally chic, the fluid skirt and dramatic sleeves will add movement when you walk. Style with two-strap sandals and minimal jewellery in tones of gold.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
