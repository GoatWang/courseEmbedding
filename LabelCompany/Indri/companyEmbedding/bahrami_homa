                           Living with uncertainty is an everyday reality for most business entities today. This is especially the case for knowledge-intensive
                              enterprises, such as those in technology, financial services, biotechnology and telecommunications, where new innovations
                              and shifting customer preferences can radically change competitive dynamics. The focus of the book is on how knowledge enterprises
                              can harness uncertainty by becoming super-flexible. Based on over 20 years of field research and practical experience in Silicon
                              Valley's technology ecosystem, the authors present conceptual frameworks, illustrative examples and practical lessons for
                              strategizing, organizing and managing knowledge-based enterprises in turbulent settings

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsToday, we live in a dynamic and inter-connected world. A multitude of "revision triggers" make it necessary to anticipate, prepare for, and continuously adapt to new realities. The key to dynamic adaptation we argue, is to become "super-flexible". Super-flexibility is defined as the ability to engage in a continuous balancing act: on the one hand, we need to withstand turbulence and create stable anchors, on the other hand, we have to transform and adapt to new realities.

About this book




Today, we live in a dynamic and inter-connected world. A multitude of "revision triggers" make it necessary to anticipate, prepare for, and continuously adapt to new realities. The key to dynamic adaptation we argue, is to become "super-flexible". Super-flexibility is defined as the ability to engage in a continuous balancing act: on the one hand, we need to withstand turbulence and create stable anchors, on the other hand, we have to transform and adapt to new realities. Our leadership "toolkit" should help us diagnose on the fly, and take rapid actions as new developments unfold. This book is about how business leaders  can harness uncertainty and make their teams and enterprises "super-flexible". Based on 25 years of field research, advisory work, and professional experience in Silicon Valley' s innovative ecosystem, the authors present a cross-functional, "general management" toolkit for strategizing, organizing, leading, and ultimately re-inventing knowledge enterprises for a dynamic world.

            Nimble Storage: Scaling Talent Strategy Amidst Hyper-Growth

                Source:

                UC Berkeley - Haas School of Business


            The Nimble Storage case study tells the story of a rapidly growing storage startup in Silicon Valley. The key protagonists are CEO Suresh Vasudevan, along with the Vice President of Human Resources, Paul Whitney. The case study describes the history of the company, the context in which Whitney was hired, and key people initiatives since Whitney's arrival. With lofty ambitions, such as transforming the world of storage through its hybrid storage system, and with the stated goal of becoming a billion dollar company in three years, Vasudevan, Whitney, and the senior team believed that Nimble's people strategy would be critical in helping achieve its ambitious goals and thus focused on short- and long-term people initiatives in order to scale. The case study ends with the launch of the company's new leadership program, LEAD and raises questions about Nimble's future growth and international expansion, specifically how its growth plans might affect people initiatives going forward.


                Learning Objective:

                To teach students about the rapidly growing storage industry and a start-up that has experience and managed hyper-growth through its people strategy and initiatives.

                Issues:

Insights              Super-Flexibility & Thriving in a World of Constant Change








Super-Flexibility & Thriving in a World of Constant Change





Homa Bahrami | Senior Lecturer, Haas School of Business; expert in organizational effectiveness
 
I have worked with business leaders from several global companies on leadership and organizational challenges at the Haas Center for Executive Education during the last six months; among them, a life science company experiencing hyper-growth; a leading software company pioneering innovative approaches to adapt to the new realities of the “cloud”, a European energy company, adjusting to low oil prices, and a pioneering tech company preparing for its next phase of growth. Each faces its own unique challenges, but they all have one common wish: how to develop a flexible organizational and leadership DNA to thrive in a world of constant change. 
 
As it happens, I have had the good fortune of working on this topic, as a researcher, writer, executive educator and advisor for the past 30 years. I have examined organizational architectures, team practices and leadership skills. My colleague, Stuart Evans from Carnegie Mellon, and I have distilled dynamic practices that enable leaders to succeed in a world of constant change. Our work has taken us to young start-ups, growing adolescents and established corporations, not only in Silicon Valley, but also in different parts of the world. 
 
We have observed 3 modes of adaptation in practice: Deliberate adaptation, as is the case with disruptive innovators; forced adaptation, as is most commonly observed in crisis situations; and accidental adaptation, when timing and luck are critical determinants of success. 
 
In today’s fluid world, deliberate adaptation is a prized capability. It enables business leaders and knowledge workers to be the drivers of their own destiny. But what are the tools that enable leaders to engage in deliberate adaptation? We have coined the umbrella term “super-flexibility” to describe the capacity to deliberately adapt to new realities. In a nutshell, super-flexibility integrates several themes that facilitate adaptation: 
 
Agility, the ability to be fast and move quickly to seize opportunities or side-step threats
Versatility, the ability to wear different hats and switch gears depending on the context and the situation
Hedging, the ability to plan ahead, hedge your bets, and think through different contingencies and scenarios
Robustness, the ability to have clear intentions, absorb shocks, be persistent, and remain viable
Resilience, the ability to bounce back and recover from setbacks
 
These adaptive qualities are not just relevant for Silicon Valley innovators and entrepreneurs; they are critical for business leaders whose enterprises are undergoing a massive digital transformation. As one global leader commented: “we are playing a new game, but using old rules. We need new ideas and fresh thinking that can help us lead in a world where change is the only constant.” This reminds me of Charles Darwin’s famous quote: “It is not the strongest or the most intelligent that survive, but the most adaptable.”
 
Dr. Bahrami applies decades of research and consulting to developing leaders at the Berkeley Center for Executive Education. Learn from her in the New Manager Boot Camp and Boot Camp for Experienced Managers programs, and in her InFocus podcast.

Natasha, Oklahoma

Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
