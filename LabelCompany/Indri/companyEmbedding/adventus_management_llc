Status on PMBOK 6th EditionThe Project Management Institute (PMI) has released an "Exposure Draft" of the new PMBOK for review by PMI members.  Adventus is reviewing it and will be updating training material in advance of the release of the 6th edition. The new PMBOK is currently slated for release in the 3rd quarter of 2017, which is considerably later than the "every 4 year" update schedule. Specific information can be found at http://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational-standards-exposure-draft, but summary information will be provided on this site as it becomes available.
What does this mean for persons preparing for the PMP or CAPM exams?
Upon release of a new version of the PMBOK the common practice of PMI is to change the exam content to match it six months later. PMI is currently stating that certification exams will be updated in the 1st quarter of 2017. Given that the updated exams have to be verified and made available to testing centers, it appears that anyone who takes their exam before the 2nd quarter of 2018 will be tested on the PMBOK 5th Edition.
More information will be posted here as it becomes available.Online Exam Prep SessionsPMI is coming out with a new version of the PMBOK during the next quarter. If you have been putting off taking your PMP or CAPM certification exam, now is the time to start preparing in earnest. The exam content is expected to change in the second quarter of 2018.
This is your chance. If you are a former student in my project management classes and are interested in attending online sessions to cover information that is troublesome to you, need to let me know. I am willing to do FREE web-based sessions on
topics of interest in the evenings for an hour or two, providing there is sufficient interest. Here is how it will work.
You need to contact me via email or by using the Contact Adventus option at the top of the page. Provide the following information:

Provide an email address that I can use to contact you about the sessions.
Let me know the topics that you would like to review.
Provide general information about what weekdays and evening would work best for you.  

As I get feedback I will add information to this article. Look forward to hearing from you.
- Tom Brewer, PMP



 CURRENT STATUS (As of July 2, 2017)

AMERICAN GILSONITE COMPANY ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH ADVENTUS MATERIAL STRATEGIES, LLC





American Gilsonite Company ("American Gilsonite", or "AGC"), the world's principal commercial miner and processor of uintaite, the unique mineral marketed under its trademark name "Gilsonite®," today announced a strategic partnership with Adventus Material Strategies, LLC (“Adventus”). AGC and Adventus will work together to develop an effective marketing and commercialization strategy to increase asphalt sales among business and government customers.
Through the partnership, AGC aims to leverage the expertise of the Adventus leadership team to expand the company’s reach and diversify its customer base. The Adventus team will pursue sales agreements across the North American industrial asphalt sector including: roads, airport runway and FAA work, specialty coatings and specialty emulsion applications. 







“We are excited about the combination of talent this partnership presents to our company, which enables us to provide a higher level of asphalt paving expertise to our clients,” said David Gallagher, president and chief executive officer for American Gilsonite Company. “The Adventus team has over 75 years of combined technical and sales experience in the asphalt industry. The company’s in-depth knowledge of the forces driving the asphalt market complement our company’s growth and expansion strategy.” 
Adventus is a team of professionals with decades of experience in the commercialization of technology in the chemicals, polymers, and road infrastructure segments of the economy. The company has a positive track record in developing and launching products that have been used in asphalt modification, pavement rehabilitation and pavement maintenance.
“Adventus sees tremendous value in our partnership with American Gilsonite Company. We value the vision, integrity and professionalism of AGC’s management team,” said Brian J Majeska, principal for Adventus Material Strategies, LLC. “AGC’s investments in Gilsonite reserves, processing and technical capabilities are world class. We believe the company is positioned for excellent growth in many areas of the asphalt modification segment. Specifically, we see opportunities in more cost-effective asphalt binder formulations to meet the updated Performance Grade (PG) asphalt specifications, and to leverage AGC’s technology to improve solvent resistance in many asphalt maintenance applications.”
About American Gilsonite CompanyAGC operates as an industrial minerals company and is the world's primary miner and processor of uintaite, a variety of asphaltite, a specialty hydrocarbon which AGC markets to industrial customers under its registered trademark name “Gilsonite®”. Gilsonite is a glossy, black, solid naturally occurring hydrocarbon similar in appearance to hard asphalt and is believed to be found in commercial quantities only in the Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, Gilsonite has been used in more than 160 products. The Company sells its products to customers in four primary markets: (i) oil and gas, (ii) inks and paints, (iii) foundry and (iv) asphalt. AGC is headquartered in Houston, Texas.
About Adventus Material StrategiesAdventus’ team of professionals has commercialized over $100 million of new technology into the road industry. These technologies include: specialty chemicals, polymers, asphalt binders, asphalt emulsions and mixture technologies. With more than 75 years of combined leadership experience, Adventus offers customers expert guidance through the asphalt and foundry markets throughout North America.

Columbia Center
Rosemont, Illinois
  


















In mid October 2014, Adventus closed on its sixth office property, with the purchase of the Columbia Center Complex at O'Hare, in suburban Chicago.
Located in Rosemont, Illinois, the Columbia Center complex consists of three buildings in very close proximity to each other. The buildings are all between 7 and 9 stories, contain 620,214 square feet of leaseable area in total, and were purchased for US $93.1 million, or $150/sf. The properties, which are 93% leased on a long term basis, include a number of high profile tenants including Brunswick Corp., the world's largest maker of fitness equipment (Life Fitness), and World Kitchen LLC, a private manufactorer of kitchenware products including several notable brands (Pyrex and Corningware).
The debt financing for the complex was initiated by JP Morgan Chase who provided $66.5M of non-recourse first mortgage financing, on a 10-year basis at a rate of 4.22%.
Upon completion of this purchase Rod Johnston, President and CEO of Adventus, stated: "The Columbia Center complex is a strategic addition to the Adventus portfolio which now stands at just under 2.1 million square feet with a value of approximately US $250M. The complex itself offers a superior location, access to the neighboring entertainment district, Stephens Convention Center, and is within walking distance of the Blue Line, Chicago's rapid transit system which connect Downtown and Metra. In addition, the complex has a first class amenity package including a state of the art fitness center, two delis, manned security, conference facility, covered parking and shuttle service. We believe the complex offers significant potential rental growth when compared to the competing properties in the area and, as such, have been targeting the complex for acquisition by Adventus for approximately two years.
