I spend my day with kids and their educators.  I wake up every day ready to help make a difference in their educational experience – and that means something.  It’s a lot of work, but the rewards are priceless.  My workday is spent with kids in classrooms, on playgrounds – side-by-side with the students -- and helping volunteers to maximize their fundraising time.

We’re working hard to make fundraising easier! | Apex Fun Run

About Us

We’re working hard to make fundraising easier!


Our Method
is to collaborate with school PTO/As and faculty to build student leaders through a meaningful, “hassle-free” and financially successful school fun run.
We Believe

Every child can change their school, and the world, in a profound way
Serving others brings the greatest joy and contributes to the greatest good
Learning by doing and exercise are both undervalued and underutilized in fundraising today
Encouragement and enthusiasm build others up—we will help build leaders
Raising money for your child’s school can also serve as a positive learning experience
Many people giving a little reduces the individual burden on the typical givers and donors


Teachers Have Skin in the Game
                    and that makes for highly-motivated and excited coaches.  Your teachers will coach their classroom teams to greater heights knowing that in the end, a portion of what the classroom raises goes straight back to the teacher for their classroom.
                


Amy's Story

In one year, our dear friend, Amy Donnell, spent over $500 on supplies for her 1st grade class. There were budget cuts for the school, and as a teacher, this was a huge burden on her finances. Furthermore, her school was sick of product-based fundraisers with no learning opportunities for the students. We have since teamed up with Amy to revolutionize school fundraising!

Raving Fans














“This is a great fundraiser that is different from the rest! Parents are not stuck buying wrapping paper or cookies or something they do not really want but they are encouraging their children to run and get healthy. All the while these amazing guys are running around your campus all day long promoting the fundraiser so you do not have to. Their lessons are short and to the point, yet they see every kid every day and promote fitness, fun and character. Everyone was involved the day of the race. Even parents came out to watch and support the school and the students. It was amazing!”
Jennifer Silva - Principal, Sundance Elementary School, Peoria, AZ.
“This is by far the BEST event we have ever done, and the easiest.  As a board member, it was just phenomenal! The children are still talking about this event months later and I feel they learned great life attributes. The Teachers loved the event because they didn't have to do much and felt their children were learning. We are also now able to pay for teachers aids once again next year.”
Lisa Johnson, PTO VP of Fundraising, Anasazi Elementary, Scottsdale, AZ
“Fundraising should not be about selling useless, overpriced items. The Apex Fun Run allows students to realize that they are helping the school, and working hard for it. They learn valuable lessons in the process, such as leadership, stewardship, and working with others, and they get exercise in the process.  I found the Apex Fun Run team to be very helpful, and would recommend them to other PTOs. They have very enthusiastic team members, who really encouraged the students.”
Kate Kozak, PTO President, Sechrist Elementary, Flagstaff, AZ
“This was our first time working with Apex Fun Run. We did not know what to expect. As a matter of fact, we really considered doing this on our own at first. However, Apex made it so easy for us as a PTA and that was what we were looking for. As parents, we are busy with our kids, work, home, etc., and to add a huge fun run to our list of things to do was overwhelming. Apex made it easy and worth our time and money. They have all the necessary tools in place to be able to pull it off and for us, that was worth it.”
Tina Washburn, PTA President, Eagle College Prep Elementary, Phoenix, AZ
“The group was extremely organized, professional and sincere and brought both a good message to our students and a "simple" way to address fitness and raise PTO funds. The results in the classroom and in the bank were fantastic.”
Jeff Quizberg, Principal, Scottsdale, AZ
“I've been a part of a lot of fundraisers and Apex is by far the best and easiest solution that keeps more money for the school and community, all while actually teaching our kids valuable leadership skills. I know the Apex team personally and they live out leadership in and out of the school. Even if my school had a fundraiser already scheduled, I'd still recommend teaming up with the Apex crew...it's worth it.”
-Dr. Russell Marshall, President of Arrow Educational Services Texas Region 10 Superintendent of the Year
“Apex Fun Run combines the essential elements needed for success. Leadership, teamwork, fitness, and enthusiasm are some of the qualities that have helped me succeed on the PGA Tour. I believe in what Apex Fun Run is doing and I think that it is a great investment in our youth!”
-Kevin Streelman, PGA Tour player and winner of the 2009 Kodak Challenge
“Instilling great qualities in our children all while supporting the school in our fundraising efforts is a great combination. We look forward to working with Apex Fun Run back in our school as soon as possible.”
-Dave Zylstra, Principal at OHCS, WA
“We place great importance on strong character, which is the essence of Apex Fun Run. For two weeks, the Apex team dedicates themselves to serving your school by building leaders. They really believe that every child can change the world, and that becomes evident when you hold your first fun run.”
-Jeff Sandefer, Co-Founder of the Acton Academy, TX
“The staff was amazing, and the energy they brought was tangible! Students and parents alike have had a wonderful experience. Thank you!”
-Eric Garland, Administrator, Flagstaff Christian Community School

Acton in Action: Sprinting with Apex Fun Run

While enrolled at Acton, our students are run through the trenches, stepping into the shoes of real entrepreneurs as they dissect, decide and debate hundreds of real life business cases. But no matter how many great lessons you can take from a good case discussion, it’s always most exciting to check in with our alumni and learn about the real businesses, jobs and value that they’ve created since graduating from Acton. 
We recently caught up with Scott Donnell (’09) who founded Apex Fun Run about 18 months after graduating from Acton. He related his company’s successes, some surprises, and talked about how the firm is the realization of both market needs and his pursuit of his own passion and calling.
Dossier
Company: Apex Fun Run
Acton Alumni: Scott Donnell (’09), President and Founder
Founded: January 2011
Headquarters: Phoenix, AZ
Employees: 25
About: Apex Fun Run helps elementary schools raise more funds than they ever have in the past while promoting fitness and teaching its students fun and engaging lessons about leadership. Its three-person teams of former pro and collegiate athletes spend two weeks in each school presenting Apex’s unique curriculum and prepping students, teachers and parents for the big race day. To date, the program has helped schools in four states (with two more scheduled) and typically raises twice as many funds for a school than any other elementary school fundraising product or company.
See Apex Fun Run in action on Vimeo or YouTube.
Opportunity
In 2009, when he graduated from Acton, Scott knew that he wanted to be his own boss, be in the fitness field, and work with children.
“I’ve always loved working with kids,” Scott said. “I’m a marathon runner and was an All-American tennis player in college. My heart has always been with kids and fitness. I wanted to do something that helped mold character, and I wanted to run my own business. You can be a pastor, counselor or teacher, but none of those paths meant owning your own business.”
Scott saw an opportunity when he realized that his girlfriend Amy (now his wife), who taught elementary school, spent $500 of her own money on her students every year.
“And she wasn’t alone,’ said Scott. “That’s when I knew that we had to help.
“What’s out there now is cookie dough sales, bake sales, other product sales. They have been a necessary evil. But they don’t teach kids anything. We challenged ourselves to create a fundraiser where we teach fitness and leadership skills, while raising money to support schools and teachers.”
Launch
That challenge led to the development of Apex’s product and model. A team of three athletes goes into a school for two weeks, leading all classes and all students in a custom-designed curriculum to prepare students for the big run and fundraising event, while teaching lessons about character. The leadership curriculum is fresh every year.
During this time, students collect pledges for each lap that they’ll run on race day. The final day is the full Fun Run, where students run laps on a course through giant inflatable tunnels and lined with orange cones. Most students run 26 to 36 laps, earning their pledged amounts for every lap they run.
“A single pledge might be 50 cents or $1 per lap, or it could be more,” said Scott. Every student gets a T-shirt or jersey with a lap scorecard on the back. And there are prizes, unique every year.
“Between the three crew members on campus, and support from our headquarters, each school gets about 300 hours of dedicated support from Apex,” said Scott. “It’s all hassle free to the school.”
Raising Money and Incentives
“Financially, we are able to raise about twice as much as traditional school fundraising programs. If they average $10,000 with cookie dough sales, then they’ll make $20,000 with us,” said Scott.
Once the race is complete and funds are collected, Apex, an LLC, collects a set percentage after all pledges are collected and accounted for with the school. The school never pays a cent in advance for any of the work that Apex does or the materials it uses or gives the students. Instead, the company covers all costs for each school’s program, and collects its percentage fee at the end. Scott reports that Apex’s fee averages 20% less than the percentages taken by his competitors, the traditional fundraising product sales companies.
In addition, ten percent of the total amount raised goes directly to the teachers to spend on their classes. Each teacher gets exactly ten percent of what his or her class raises, which further motivates teachers and their students.
Haley Elementary in Chandler, AZ recently completed the Apex Fun Run. Natalie Kredit, a 4th grade teacher and student council advisor at the school, commented on Apex’s appeal.
“Beyond the promise of higher funds,” she said, “What really convinced teachers was that Apex oversaw 100 percent of fundraising activities, training, parents, prizes and everything else. It took us out of the equation so we could focus on enjoying the experience and teaching opportunities with our students.
“This year, we also decided as a school that Apex would be the only fundraiser we would do for the whole year,” Natalie explained. “We had a very team-oriented goal. In the past, we did multiple fundraisers during the year for the Parent Teacher Organization, for teachers, for the student council. This year we made sure parents knew that it was the only time we’d ask them to give. It really allowed them to participate fully, knowing that we weren’t going to be hitting them up again in six weeks.”
Life of Meaning
“Our curriculum and lessons are about character traits – integrity, honesty, being uplifting,” explained Scott. “We get success stories all the time about kids and how they remember our lessons. Teachers have been able to use and build on the lessons from last year. Even kindergartners remember our stuff later on.”
“Our school’s morale reached an all-time high during the Fun Run. Parents and teachers got involved. It was a really fun time on our campus,” said Natalie. “And the Apex employees are amazing. The kids adore them. In fact, we’re having a sock hop this December and the kids keep begging to invite our Apex team.”
“The whole goal is to be a shot in the arm for the school for two weeks,” said Scott. “Energy and enthusiasm are our sticky factor.”
Growth
Fitting for a company that motivates runners, Apex is growing at a rapid pace.
In its first year, it had 1.5 teams that worked with 17,000 elementary-aged kids. It now has six teams and by June 2013 it is scheduled to have worked with 100 schools and 60,000 kids in the 2013 school year. “In the current school year, we expect to raise $2 million for schools,” said Scott.
“We don’t do paid marketing at all. It’s a ‘come and see’ model,” he continued. “And word of mouth. People love telling the story of what we do. It’s great for the kids, great for the schools and great for the teachers.”
Natalie agreed, “Parents, teachers, kids and our principal are all looking forward to working with Apex again next year.”
Contracts for schools are currently booked 12 months in advance. To date, runs have been held or scheduled in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Texas and Washington. The demand is such that Apex is currently prepping to franchise its operation in select US markets.
Lessons Learned at Acton
Like with any business, it hasn’t been an effortless climb. Scott and his team have put in many long, grueling hours. Since founding the company, Scott said they’ve had more than 50 surprises and obstacles, including lost shipments and having a storage unit robbed of supplies and equipment.
“This is my first time running and growing a business,” said Scott, “and like we learned at Acton, the challenge of balancing sales and operations is ongoing. We also have to find, hire and train the right people, then keep them employed by making sure schools are scheduled.”
Scott credits Acton with several of his earliest key successes. “Acton’s Sales Challenge played a big part. We walked into 90 schools. I had to go into PTA meetings and introduce myself, without knowing anyone, and pitch our run. My experience with the Sales Challenge, and in the classroom really prepared me for that.”
His pitch was made even tougher by another key Acton lesson. “At Acton, I also learned a lot about moving as many fixed costs as possible into variable costs. So although we did a lot of tests, trials and small cheap experiments, we didn’t pay for any full blown runs before lining up contracts. We booked two dozen schools for the first year, all after doing only a few test races at schools. If you build it, they might come. If you book them first, they’ll have to come.”
“I also took a lesson from our Life of Meaning class to heart. I knew that you shouldn’t discard the things you’re good at, or the things you love, just to make money.”
But Scott said his primary advantage from Acton was “just plain grit.”
The work ethic at Acton… It’s just plain grueling. But you go through Acton and you emerge, and you know you can do it.”
“It’s also been surprising just how loved we are at the schools,” he said. “School budgets and teacher budgets are just hurting so much. So we receive so much appreciation for helping them. And the kids… we’ve even had teddy bears named after us. It’s that encouragement at all levels from the schools that motivates us and keeps us going.”

10 miles. 20+ obstacles.
Probably the toughest event on the planet
Tough Mudder is 10 miles of mud and 20+ obstacles designed to drag you out of your comfort zone. The ordinary will always be there. Why not try for something extra? With no podiums, winners, or clocks to race against, Tough Mudder isn’t about how fast you can cross the finish line. It’s about pushing yourself. It’s about teamwork, camaraderie, and accomplishing something extraordinary. So challenge yourself. Find more in the mud. Escape the Ordinary.

 Obstacle Innovation
Our course designers and engineers are the most creative, forward-thinking, and maybe even slightly insane team of innovators on the planet. Whether they’re trekking the globe for inspiration, or testing new ideas in the lab, they’re constantly working to make sure our obstacles completely blow your mind. Check out just a few of the ass-kicking, mind-bending creations you’ll see on the course in 2017.
 

   
  
 The Block Ness Monster
The Block Ness Monster is as epic and tricky as Nessie herself. Mudders have to help one another push, pull, and roll their way through 60ft of slick, rotating barriers.
 

   
  
 Pyramid Scheme
Unlike its namesake, this obstacle is all about teamwork scramble, climb, and push your way up a slippery incline with the help of your fellow Mudders
 

   
  
 Arctic Enema 2.0
Our favorite icy plunge has been updated to include a high speed entry slide and center wall you must scale to escape the 10 tons of ice we jam into this frigid dumpster dive.
 

   
  
 Everest 2.0
This slick quarter pipe is over 15’ tall, with a recurved top to make it extra hard to get that handhold. You can aim for the top, but there’s no promise you won’t end up at the bottom.
 
 
 


Tougher Together

The strength of one person is nothing compared to the power of a team. Tough Mudder’s full lineup of team-oriented obstacles guarantees that you’ll cross the finish line with more friends than you started with. Whether it’s through a helping hand or an extra vote of confidence, your fellow Mudders will be there for you every step of the way. Whether you arrive solo or with a team, all you need to come with is the strength to leave your fears in the parking lot and the willingness to push the boundaries of your comfort zone.

Unforgettable Experiences 
Wondering what it’s like to run a Tough Mudder? Don’t take our word for it—see what these Legionnaires are saying.





My first Tough Mudder was a total surprise. I started the day with one friend and finished with twelve new friends. I was able to get past my pain because of the core values of Tough Mudder—because of TEAMWORK! I am grateful to Tough Mudder because they inspired my motto "complete, not compete.” I only compete against myself.
- Haruko Harrington Chan, 2x Legionnaire




Tough Mudder takes me outside my comfort zone and tests me both physically and mentally...It is this camaraderie, along with the opportunity to challenge myself, which keeps me coming back to Tough Mudder, event after event. 
- Damian Schultz, 27x Legionnaire




If you really want to know why I'm passionate about Tough Mudder, I'm going to need more than a mere paragraph to explain…
- Joe Perry, 57x Legionnaire




I run for the feeling of pride knowing that you helped someone overcome a difficult challenge. I run for the teamwork and camaraderie that only Mudders understand and share throughout these events. Tough Mudder is a life changing experience that I hope to continue sharing with new people every day.
- John Thoel, 3x Legionnaire

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
