BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; Mallinckrodt President Named Chief Executive


By Leonard Sloane


Published: February 12, 1981









                    Raymond F. Bentele, the 44-year-old president of Mallinckrodt, Inc., has been named chief executive officer of the chemical and health-care products corporation. He succeeds Harold E. Thayer, 68, who continues as chairman.        

                    The St. Louis company also appointed John L. Ufheil, its 47-year-old executive vice president, as chief operating officer.        

                    ''My primary thing will be the strategic planning and direction of the company,'' Mr. Bentele said in a telephone interview. ''In interfacing with the customers and the operating units of the company, I would think that that's going to take up to half of my time.''        

                    Mr. Bentele spent five years at S.D. Leidesdorf & Company, a certified public accounting firm, before joining the Germania Savings and Loan Association in Alton, Ill., as treasurer and controller in 1965. He came to Mallinckrodt in 1967 as a senior financial analyst, became president in 1978 and chief operating officer the following year.        

                    Mr. Ufheil began his career at Dexter Travenol Laboratories in 1959, and left 16 years later to become vice president-marketing and operations of C.R. Bard International. He joined Mallinckrodt in 1977 as a senior vice president and group executive and was promoted to executive vice president last December.        

                    ''We have tried to structure a company with a good deal of balance,'' Mr. Bentele said. ''Managing the company through times of economic uncertainty will be a major challenge.''
