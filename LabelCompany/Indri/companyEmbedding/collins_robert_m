The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America
Robert M. Collins

Robert Collins' book explores the growth of America in terms of material prosperity. Collins interweaves economic history and cultural analysis onto his examination of postwar growth politics. The book contrasts the reasons for expansion and the way it has occurred in the past fifty years with the negative effects it has produced and the reactions against it. He also looks at the attitudes and behaviors that have developed as Americans have become a people of more.

The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America
Robert M. Collins



Description



James Carville famously reminded Bill Clinton throughout 1992 that "it's the economy, stupid." Yet, for the last forty years, historians of modern America have ignored the economy to focus on cultural, social, and political themes, from the birth of modern feminism to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now a scholar has stepped forward to place the economy back in its rightful place, at the center of his historical narrative. In More, Robert M. Collins reexamines the history of the United States from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, focusing on the federal government's determined pursuit of economic growth. After tracing the emergence of growth as a priority during FDR's presidency, Collins explores the record of successive administrations, highlighting both their success in fostering growth and its partisan uses. Collins reveals that the obsession with growth appears not only as a matter of policy, but as an expression of Cold War ideology--both a means to pay for the arms build-up and proof of the superiority of the United States' market economy. But under Johnson, this enthusiasm sparked a crisis: spending on Vietnam unleashed runaway inflation, while the nation struggled with the moral consequences of its prosperity, reflected in books such as John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. More continues up to the end of the 1990s, as Collins explains the real impact of Reagan's policies and astutely assesses Clinton's "disciplined growthmanship," which combined deficit reduction and a relaxed but watchful monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.  Writing with eloquence and analytical clarity, Robert M. Collins offers a startlingly new framework for understanding the history of postwar America.

The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America
Robert M. Collins


Reviews and Awards


More offers a thoughtful, balanced, clearly written, and entertaining account of post-World War II America's love affair with the blessings of economic growth. In the process we learn much about federal efforts, sometimes successful, sometimes not, to sustain it. I learned a great deal about policymaking and economic ideas from Collins' thoroughly researched analysis."--James T. Patterson, author of Grand Expectations:The United States, 1945-1974
More is one of those rare books that will actually change how historians perceive the past. Through the prism of government attitudes toward abundance, Robert Collins finds fresh things to say about American presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, challenges current perceptions of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and raises searching questions about how we should evaluate economic policy today."--William E. Leuchtenburg, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
"In More, Robert Collins provides a thoroughly historicized account of how American attitudes toward economic growth have evolved in the latter half of the twentieth century. This project, altogether unusual and sorely needed, prompts us to examine critically a vast array of deeply-held beliefs concerning the virtues and costs of economic expansion in a fashion that is as welcome as it is necessary. Moreover, it allows Collins to provide us with a novel and most thought-provoking consideration of the social and political forces that paved the way for the 'Supply-Side Revolution' of the Reagan years. A fine achievement and a most important contribution."--Michael A. Bernstein, University of California, San Diego
"More is a brilliant and fascinating examination of the postwar 'politics of growth' from its liberal heyday between the late 1940s and the late 1960s, through its trials in the 1970s, and into its antistatist reincarnation in the 1980s and beyond. 'Growthmanship,' in Robert Collins' engaging account, is at once an economic panacea, a political compromise, and a cultural consensus--a tangle of aspirations and anxieties that confounded policymakers both when it paid off and when it did not. This is economic history at its best, offering both a subtle and accessible account of growth politics and its dilemmas, and a compelling argument for their importance in framing our broader understanding of the postwar era."--Colin Gordon, University of Iowa
"More is essential reading for anyone interested in American growth policy since the New Deal. Thoroughly researched, lucidly written, and fully cognizant of the subject's complexities and ambiguities, it offers not only a fascinating and much needed reconstruction of American growth initiatives and their critics but also a new and persuasive conceptualization of successive growth regimes and divergent political visions and prescriptions. In major respects, it adds to or alters our understanding of New Deal ambivalence, post-New Deal liberalism, anti-New Deal forms of growthmanship, the role of economists in policy making, and current debates about sustainable growth."--Ellis W. Hawley, University of Iowa

A Professional Skin Care Line With You In Mind
Since the 1950s, G.M. Collin’s dedication to only the highest quality of skin corrective clinical treatments for people of all ages has resulted in the highest accolades and awards. The company’s goal is to produce more luminescent, healthier, younger-looking skin, and they succeed with being at the forefront of technology, dermatology, and natural solutions. Getting the best skincare doesn’t require going to a spa or esthetician: with G.M. Collin’s modern skincare products, you’re the skin care professional!
Cleansers
The Hydramucine Facial Cleansing Milk is one of G.M. Collins’ best sellers on Beauty Bridge, and for great reason: this cleanser is soft enough for the most sensitive of skin types, while simultaneously tough enough to remove remnants of makeup and oil. Lavandula hybrida smoothes skin irregularities while eucalyptus oil restricts blemish-producing bacteria.
If you have moderate skin dryness issues, the Hydramucine Cleansing Set includes the Facial Cleansing Milk and Treating Mist, which is a fragrance- and alcohol-free product that promotes balanced hydration throughout the day. The grapefruit and citrus peel oils are sure to invigorate your senses!
Oxygen skin care has become an understandably popular choice used by people every day. For normal-to-oily skin, the G.M. Collins Deep Cleansing Solution offers deep cleaning, alcohol- and fragrance-free tincture that won’t dry out your complexion. Say ‘goodbye’ to embedded oils and makeup, and ‘hello’ to balanced, radiant skin with this antimicrobial cleanser infused with chamomile and mint (for that extra fresh tingle!).
Moisturizers and Creams
If you live in a more arid climate, the Hydramucine Optimal Cream will be the first thing you’ll want to reach for in the morning, and the last thing before you go to bed. With water lily and bamboo extracts working as anti-inflammatory agents, you’ll soothe even the most irritated skin. For extra dry skin, apply the Hydramucine Optimal Serum before applying the cream.
We’ve all felt self-conscious about sagging skin and stretch marks, and understand they’re part of nature, but G.M. Collin’s Body Firming Cream improves skin elasticity with organic Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, and tones with organic ginger root extract. Safe to use during pregnancy, be sure to rub in a circular motion. Twice weekly, exfoliate stretch marks and keloids and you’ll keep your smooth, gorgeous complexion intact.
The Essential Oil Complex is a great topical treatment for acne-prone skin, and can be used anywhere from 2-6 times a day, depending on the severity of blemishes. Aloe vera calms skin, while salicylic acid and nettle extract remove comedones and other skin imperfections. If you’re looking for a matte-like quality to your skin, this Essential Oil Complex might be the perfect topical solution.
Traveling can do a number on the skin, and dehydration is definitely a major concern that can happen to the best of us. The travel-friendly Hydrating Travel Kit contains some of the most popular G.M. Collin products: the Hydramucine Cleansing Milk, Treating Mist, and Optimal Cream, which are everything you need to keep skin happy and healthy while on the road or on a plane.
Eye Treatments
Instant Radiance Anti-Aging Eye Patches infuse the eye area with a hydrogel blend of watermelon (rich in vitamin C, lycopene, and other antioxidants), lupin seed oil, and vitamin A. Get them in packs of 5, and place them over your eyes whenever you need a rejuvenating boost.
G.M. Collin’s Eye Contour Corrector improves the appearance of eye areas with its remarkable anti-aging formula replete with Vitamins E and A. It tightens, smoothes, and even lightens and brightens the complexion of lids and dark circles, and can easily be used under concealers for all-day makeup hold.
Your eyes are the windows to your soul, and the G.M. Collin Bota-Peptide Eye Contour visibly smoothes with a dermo-decontracting effect on fine lines and wrinkles. Puffiness and dark circles will fade away with this professional facial product, giving your gorgeous eyes a younger, more radiant appeal.
Anti-aging Serums
The G.M. Collin Diamond Serum works to provide anti-aging benefits while visibly improving skin texture. You’ll find the best, longest-lasting hydration with this product while fighting off environmental issues like pollution and free radicals with this professional skin care line. The diamond peptide within is a natural ingredient to increase water absorption and keep skin plumper and smoother, while the snow algae is essentially a ‘fountain of youth’, which helps to increase DNA repair.
G.M. Collin’s Active C Serum is a 4-week treatment that comes in capsule form. When you’re ready to start erasing fine lines and protecting your skin from harsh free radicals, prepare one of the vials within the package. Apply 5 drops of the Active C Serum along crow’s feet and smile lines, and simply follow with your favorite G.M. Collin moisturizer. Within a month of using this skin care treatment, you’ll see noticeable improvements in your fine lines and wrinkles.
