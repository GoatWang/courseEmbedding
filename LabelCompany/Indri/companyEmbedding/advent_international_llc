Advent International Acquires Noosa Yoghurt, LLC

BOSTON, Nov. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Advent International, one of the largest and most experienced global private equity investors, today announced that it has acquired Noosa Yoghurt, LLC, a fast-growing leader in the yoghurt category. Noosa's executive team remains in place and has retained a significant minority ownership position in the company. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
Founded in 2009 and named after a coastal town in Queensland, Australia, Noosa is known for its tangy and tart Aussie-style taste and texture. Based on an Australian family recipe that dates back to the 1930s, Noosa's commitment to family farms, local ingredients, and real fruit purees has raised its profile within the yoghurt category. Since launch, Noosa has introduced 13 varieties, including three in 2014, experienced triple digit growth and expanded its footprint across 5,000 traditional and natural grocery retailers nationwide. Noosa will also complete a $5 million expansion project in 2015 to upgrade existing equipment and keep up with increasing sales and distribution. 
"Noosa is a dynamic business with an exciting growth story," said Jeff Case, a Managing Director at Advent. "The company's management team has done a great job establishing a market in North America for its flavorful yoghurt, and we see significant potential to further develop the business by extending its product line, increasing production capacity and expanding geographically."
As part of the transaction, Advent is bringing two of its industry advisors to Noosa's Board of Directors. Bill Johnson, most recently CEO of Heinz, will serve as Chairman, and Brad Alford, former CEO of Nestle USA, will also provide his experienced guidance.
"Noosa has undergone tremendous growth since we introduced our Aussie-style yoghurt in 2010, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Advent to maintain that momentum," said Wade Groetsch, President and Chief Operating Officer of Noosa. "We believe the company will benefit from Advent's resources and expertise as we continue our mission to put more Noosa flavors on more grocery store shelves all over the country."
"Making our yoghurt is a true labor of love that our team has put their heart and soul into since our founding," said Koel Thomae, Co-Founder and Executive Vice President of Sales at Noosa. "We look forward to partnering with Advent as we bring Aussie culture and local, farm-fresh ingredients to even more consumers across the nation."
Advent has been active in the retail, consumer and leisure industry for 24 years, during which time it has invested in over 60 companies in the sector worldwide. Recent North American investments include lululemon athletica, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Serta Simmons, Party City, Bojangles', Five Below and Charlotte Russe.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges served as legal advisor to Advent. Integris Partners served as financial advisor to Noosa, and Perkins Coie LLP served as the company's legal advisor. 
About Noosa Finest YoghurtNoosa Finest Yoghurt was founded in 2009 by a collective of Aussie ex-pats and Colorado natives who set out to bring the best-tasting Aussie-style yoghurt to the United States. Noosa Finest Yoghurt is sold in more than 5,000 grocery, natural and specialty stores nationwide, including Whole Foods Markets, Target, Safeway and Kroger. Noosa is available in 13 flavors and sold in 4-ounce variety packs and individual 8- and 16-ounce cups.

Advent was founded in Boston, Massachusetts as a spin-out from TA Associates by Peter Brooke. Brooke had founded TA Associates in 1968 after having expanded the venture capital operations of TA's parent Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day. In 1985, Advent raised its first fund – a $14 million corporate venture capital program for Nabisco. In 1987, the firm raised the $225 million International Network Fund, its first institutional private equity fund. The firm raised its first European fund in 1989, when the $231 million European Special Situations Fund and opened its London office.

In 1994, Advent completed fundraising for the first of its flagship series of funds, Advent Global Private Equity (GPE) II, with $415 million. In 1996, Advent expanded into Latin America raising a dedicated Advent Latin American Private Equity Fund and opening offices in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and Sao Paulo.
Advent crossed the billion dollar mark in 1997, with the raising of the $1.2 billion Advent Global Private Equity (GPE) III, and in the last few years of the 1990s, Advent raised additional sector funds focused on media and communications as well as healthcare and life sciences. Advent's founder, Peter Brooke, stepped down as the firm's CEO in 1996, but remained active as the company's chairman.[2]
Through the 2000s, Advent's expansion accelerated as the firm raised additional funds for its various fund families and opening new offices in Europe and Asia. Advent's sixth global private equity fund, raised in 2008 closed with €6.6 billion of investor commitments and the firm raised an additional €1 billion for investments in central Europe.[3][4]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
