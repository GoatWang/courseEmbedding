                                Hydro One Leading Change To Deter Metal Theft
            


            August 28, 2014
        











        Hydro One has created a YouTube video to help educate the public on the dangers of metal theft.
        





Metal theft is a serious issue for the electricity sector and Hydro One is making changes that will one day eliminate the use of valuable, pure copper at its stations across Ontario. Going forward, when the Company undertakes maintenance work and upgrades at its stations, the new groundings installed will be made of a copper and steel composite. Signage will be posted at stations alerting would be thieves that this alternative to pure copper has no scrap metal value. Annually approximately $2 million worth of copper is stolen from Hydro One.

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: January 19, 2010

 The case presents the situation faced by the board of directors at Hydro One, a government-owned Canadian electric utility, as they discuss updating the current executive compensation packages because of the pending privatization of Hydro One. As a government owned enterprise, compensation was moderated by the job security and prospects of career advancement in the public sector, but the imminent privatization required the compensation system to be revisited. The case presents details of the current compensation system for Hydro One's key officers and the comparative data for their counterparts at similar firms. The case allows for discussion of the interplay between corporate governance processes, the corresponding responsibilities of directors and the decisions they make, in particular chief executive officer and executive compensation. The postscript to the case allows for a lively class room discussion of corporate governance, fiduciary responsibility and communication among major stakeholders.
