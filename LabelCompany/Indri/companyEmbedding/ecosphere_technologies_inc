Facts and Figures



The U.S. Army is spending billions of dollars shifting toward solar energy.


The U.S. military recently announced plans to spend $7 Billion buying electricity generated by solar, wind, geothermal and biomass projects over the next three decades.


780 million people (1 in 9) lack access to clean water - WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation 2012


Lack of access to clean water and sanitation kills children at a rate equivalent of a jumbo jet crashing every four hours. - UNICEF, WHO 2009


In the U.S., about 6 gigawatts of electricity - enough to power as many as 4.8 million homes - will flow through microgrids by 2020 - Navigant Research


Military commanders have found they can save lives through energy conservation. It’s especially true in Afghanistan, where protecting fuel convoys is one of the most dangerous jobs, with one casualty for every 24 missions in some years.


For U.S. military operations, shipping fuel to remote outposts in Afghanistan can cost between $400-$1,000 / gallon.


"During World War II, the U.S. military used (an average of) one gallon of fuel per day, per Soldier," said Richard G. Kidd IV, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for Energy & Sustainability, with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy & Environment. "We now use (an average of) 20 gallons per day, per Soldier, and in Afghanistan, over 40 percent of that fuel is used to produce electricity.

            Recycling Grey Water from Mining And Commercial Excavation 
    












Ecosphere Technologies, Inc.









 




Commercial Mining Wastewater Treatment Solutions

The mining industry is facing an era of increased regulation, increased opportunity, and increased global competition. Water scarcity is driving up the value of clean water while wastewater quality is increasingly under the magnifying glass of industry regulators. It is a challenging business climate – one in which heightened sensitivity to operational costs must balance with an increased demand for output - but one in which those with vision can excel and succeed.
Ecosphere’s Ozonix® water treatment technology provides a cost-effective solution for reducing the residual wastewater streams produced in the mining industry – helping customers increase profitability, decrease production costs, and reduce overall chemical consumption, while protecting the environment.
Acid Mine Drainage
The discharge of acidic water from coal or metal mines often results in the pollution of nearby ground and surface water and liability for mining operators. Typically these mines are abandoned, but it is not uncommon for reclaimed mines to experience acid drainage. Ecosphere can help mining operations combat acid mine drainage through its portfolio of chemical-free water treatment technologies.
Mining Process Water
Ecosphere’s portfolio of advanced, green technologies empowers mining operations to maximize production, safeguard infrastructure investment, and reduce operating costs, while protecting the environment. Be it the prevention of scaling, corrosion, foaming, and biofouling, cooling water treatments, or water sterilization for boiler feed and other high purity applications, Ecosphere has life-cycle solutions for helping you meet your toughest financial and environmental challenges.
Tailing Pond Wastewater Treatment
Tailing pond water represents one of the greatest environmental liabilities for mining operations and the disposal of tailings is one of its greatest projected challenges. Ecosphere can help mine operators explore chemical-free methods for the treatment and processing of tailing pond water.
Leachate Treatment and Recovery
Mining leachate, often containing carcinogenic chemicals, can be environmentally devastating if it finds its way to surface water. Ecosphere’s patented Ozonix® technology can effectively treat leachate to ensure that it doesn’t become a liability.

            Municipal Wastewater Treatments 
    












Ecosphere Technologies, Inc.









 




Water Management Solutions for Municipalities

The capability of municipalities to meet the demands of growing populations is currently being stretched very thin: water scarcity and strict regulatory compliance are just a few of the challenges being faced. Ecosphere Technologies portfolio of patented technologies provides the means by which municipalities can at once improve the effectiveness and lower the cost of water management programs, while reducing dependency on hazardous chemicals such as chlorine. 
Water and Wastewater Treatment Services for Municipalities:
Water disinfection and sterilization
One of municipalities’ core responsibilities is ensuring the reliable availability of a clean water source to the public. Through a proven advanced oxidation process, Ecosphere’s patented, chemical-free Ozonix® water treatment technology can help municipalities meet this demand through cost-effective and environmentally responsible disinfection, oxidation and sterilization of water.
Oxidation of contaminants
Ozonix® can help municipalities decrease liability and improve capacity through the chemical free treatment of all bacteria and soluble organics in the water cycle; eliminating the need for hazardous chemical biocides commonly used to control microbial growth.
Process wastewater treatment
For over a decade, Ecosphere has been helping industrial companies solve some of the most significant process wastewater treatment challenges in the world – cost effectively and chemically free. 
Bacteria, biofilm treatment and control
Ozonix® provides highly effective, chemical-free microbial control through the complete oxidization of bacteria and destruction of bacteria cell walls and biofilms. It accomplishes this through the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH-) that are significantly more powerful than chlorine or ozone when used in isolation.
Prevention of biofouling, scaling and corrosion
Ozonix® helps protect assets and improve productivity by effectively combatting scaling, corrosion, and biofouling, while eliminating costly biocides and reducing scale inhibitors needed for corrosion control.
Sludge treatment and recovery
The processing of wastewater residuals (sewage sludge) into biosolids for reuse is a proven means of improving operational sustainability for all manner of organizations. Effective implementation of this recycling process relies almost solely on the underlying technologies that support it. Ecosphere’s portfolio of patented technologies is helping businesses and organizations around the world thrive through the chemical-free treatment and recovery of sludge.
Odor control
Over the last 10 years, odor control has become an increasingly significant consideration for wastewater treatment programs. Municipal odor challenges are typically a result of anaerobic (or “septic”) conditions, a breeding ground for sulfate-reducing bacteria. Ecosphere’s chemical-free Ozonix® technology can help wastewater treatment programs effectively control odors through a patented, advanced oxidation process that increases the mass transfer efficiency of ozone and produces OH- (hydroxyl radicals) to cost-effectively destroy bacteria.
Pretreatment
Effective pretreatment involves the treatment of wastewater to remove pollutants before it can be safely treated for human consumption or discharged. This discharge is highly regulated, and contaminants can vary. Ecosphere’s proven, chemical-free Ozonix® technologywill help municipalities achieve cost-effective wastewater pretreatment to produce environmentally safe effluent that is suitable for drinking water filtration or discharge.

                        About Us
                    


Keeping Production Processes FlowingBecause water is a vital component in our customers' production processes, scarce water resources and environmental regulation can limit their ability to bring clean energy to market. Our goal is to help clean energy producers gain more control over their water resources, quality and completion costs by providing effective mobile water recycling solutions. Now we are bringing our water know-how to the natural gas industry so that energy companies can treat and recycle water used in gas well drilling and completions.Commitment to Clean WaterEcosphere Technologies Inc. has been a water industry innovator since 1998, when company founders began developing eco-friendly technologies to solve major water remediation challenges on land and at sea. Our commitment to clean water includes ongoing investment in research and development of advanced water treatment processes, and an annual donation of two percent of revenues to help further environmental initiatives around the world.Recent events in history made our development of water filtration technology for mobile delivery systems extremely relevant. The tragedies of 9/11, the Banda Aceh Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, showed the magnitude of suffering when clean water supplies are compromised. During those years, the federal government enacted legislation calling for the nation's 8552 municipalities to have emergency backup water systems in place. The EPA tested and verified our water filtration and purification technology to treat waters contaminated by biological pathogens and other toxic substances, and deliver clean drinking water. We also developed a mobile emergency water filtration system for first responder organizations, and deployed the first unit to Waveland, Mississippi to provide safe drinking water for thousands of people in Katrina's aftermath.
Working in Harmony with the EnvironmentEcosphere Technologies' most recent 'eco-technology' breakthrough is Ecosphere Ozonix, a water recovery and recycling process with the potential to help energy companies recycle precious water resources. We have established eco-alliances with leaders in business, industry, government and environmental organizations. Together, we are developing technologies and services to ensure clean water availability in emergency disaster situations, and to enable more environmentally responsible water management practices for industry. As the world awakens to issues of global warming and humanity's impact on the planet, our commitment has never been stronger. Support for the Ocean Futures Society is but one example of how Ecosphere Technologies exemplifies the power of corporations and conservationists to pursue shared goals for the common good.

Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. announces revolutionary new solar product
with the introduction of the Ecos Power Cube.  (Photo: Business Wire)





December 11, 2006 10:04 AM Eastern Standard Time



STUART, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. (OTC BB: ESPH), the Stuart, Florida-based 
      company that creates engineered and patented Clean Tech solutions that 
      address pressing global environmental and humanitarian issues, today 
      announced that its mission to help solve the world water and energy 
      crisis can be realized with the introduction of the Ecos Power Cube (see 
      attached photo).
    


      "This important all-solar product from Ecosphere Technologies signals 
      that the Clean Tech marketplace may be the perfect fusion of commerce 
      and sustainability," indicated the leading futurist and author Dr. James 
      Canton, CEO & Chairman, Institute for Global Futures, and member of 
      Ecosphere Technologies Advisory Board. "This break-through is just what 
      the world needs now to build a prosperous and clean energy future for 
      all of humanity in the 21st century."
    

      Ecosphere’s CEO Dennis McGuire stated, “On 
      the banks of the Hudson River in 2005 Jean Michel Cousteau challenged 
      Ecosphere Technologies to create a high volume low cost water filtration 
      system that only uses the power of the sun to create electricity and 
      purify water for remote villages and third world countries. Ecosphere 
      accepted the challenge and designed the Ecos Power Cube. Ecosphere 
      Technologies will introduce this revolutionary new water filtration and 
      energy product through a newly formed subsidiary division called 
      Ecosphere Energy Solutions, Inc. The market for solar products in 2005 
      was $11 billion and the market is expected to grow to $51 billion by 
      2015. We expect this exciting new product will be well received by this 
      growing market. Ecosphere Technologies is a portal for Clean Tech 
      solutions and this is just another example of our commitment to the 
      future of the planet and our shareholders. “


      Jean Michel Cousteau, Ecosphere spokesperson, ocean pioneer and 
      environmentalist has been an ambassador and advocate to bring awareness 
      to the world water crisis since his speech at the Water For Peace Forum 
      in Kyoto in 2003. At that forum Cousteau urged policymakers to enlist 
      the private sector, which profits from water-related products, to use 
      part of their gains to help guarantee clean water for those in need. 
      Cousteau now states “Raising awareness of the 
      world water crisis was the first step in solving a problem of such 
      magnitude. The final step is for companies to provide a sustainable low 
      cost technical solution that works. The Ecos Power Cube is revolutionary 
      in the fact that it will use only the power of the sun to create and 
      store the energy needed to run water filtration components, pumps, or 
      motors. It is a perpetual motion water and electrical system that uses 
      no fossil fuels. The Ecos Power Cube can be used to provide water and 
      electricity for a small village. Multiple systems could be used 
      throughout a village to power its school, water system, buildings, and 
      communications systems. I am very proud to have been associated with 
      Ecosphere Technologies over the past 8 years and have witnessed their 
      continued commitment to protecting the people of our planet and its eco 
      systems with their Clean Tech solutions.”


      Lyndon Rive CEO of SolarCity stated. “We are 
      very excited and committed to working with Jean Michel Cousteau and 
      Ecosphere to help solve the worlds water and energy crisis. The Ecos 
      Power Cube will allow people all over the world access to clean water 
      and portable energy.”

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those set forth under "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Recent Highlights and Success  �  In January 2017, the Company and SOGS completed delivery and installation of ten  �  After approximately three years in research & development, the Company and SOGS began announcing its line of high-tech growing equipment, LED lighting solutions, specialized nutrients, facility design services and agronomic consulting services for the legal marijuana industry.  �  After approximately two years in development, the Company and EDC have broken ground on its landlord-tenant business model of leasing high-tech growing facilities to legal, licensed growers in Washington State. In November 2016, EDC announced that it received its building permit for the first phase of its Cannatech Agriculture Center in Finley, Washington and held a groundbreaking ceremony to kick start the construction process. Upon completion of construction, which is expected during the summer months of 2017, and the granting of a license to its first tenant, the tenant intends to commence growing marijuana in accordance with Washington State law and pay EDC monthly rental income.  Intellectual Property Portfolio  Because of generally accepted accounting principles and SEC accounting rules, Ecosphere's patents and patents pending are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet based at the cost it pays its counsel to process and maintain those patents. This type of accounting method does not take into account the actual fair value of the intellectual property created that can be licensed to customers and industry leaders for the 20-year life of the patents. Ecosphere's unique patents allow Ecosphere the sole right to exclude others from making, using or selling its proprietary solutions. Ecosphere's patents also allow Ecosphere to monetize its assets for shareholders by granting local, regional or global field-of-use licenses to industry-specific partners.  Current History of Product and Application Development  Since April 2014, the Company has concentrated on the design and development of high-tech growing equipment, nutrients and lighting solutions for the Precision Agriculture industry and has incurred in excess of $12 million including corporate overhead. Of this amount the Company estimates that it has incurred in excess of $6 million of costs in developing its current line of products and industry specific applications utilizing its intellectual property ("development costs"). Such development costs are exclusive of amounts paid to executive officers including our chief technology officer, who spends a significant portion of his time on research and development, and indirect general and administrative tasks. Included in these development costs are engineering salaries and benefits, direct research and development costs, and costs related to the Company's manufacturing and engineering facilities in Stuart, Florida.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  There were no changes in the Company's critical accounting estimates during the period covered by this report.   ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months ended March 31, 2017 with the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 The following table sets forth a modified version of our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations that is used in the following discussions of our results of operations: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change (Unaudited) Revenues Equipment sales and licensing $ 1,300,150 $ 6,250 $ 1,293,900 Aftermarket part and product sales 6,704 730 5,974 Royalties 10,385 - 10,385 Total revenues 1,317,239 6,980 1,310,259 Cost of revenues Equipment sales and licensing 788,899 - 788,899 Aftermarket parts and products 9,255 490 8,765 Royalties 1,915 - 1,915 Total cost of revenues 800,069 490 799,579 Gross profit 517,170 6,490 510,680 Operating expenses Salaries and employee benefits 494,352 809,653 (315,301 ) Administrative and selling 142,835 192,014 (49,179 ) Professional fees 88,552 513,534 (424,982 ) Depreciation and amortization 57,837 81,471 (23,634 ) Research and development 131,504 44,066 87,438 Bad debt - 3,643 (3,643 ) Total costs and expenses 915,080 1,644,381 (729,301) Loss from operations (397,910 ) (1,637,891 ) 1,239,981 Other income (expense) Interest expense (356,600 ) (209,002 ) (147,598 ) Loss on debt extinguishment - (120,310 ) 120,310 Change in fair value of derivative instruments 40,014 - 40,014 Other, net - 1,258 (1,258 ) Total other expense, net (316,586 ) (328,054 ) 11,468 Net loss (714,496 ) (1,965,945 ) 1,251,449 Preferred stock dividends (20,688 ) (20,688 ) - Net loss applicable to common stock (735,184 ) (1,986,633 ) 1,251,449 Net loss applicable to noncontrolling interest of consolidated subsidiaries (69,835 ) 193,380 (263,215 ) Net loss applicable to Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. common stock $ (805,019 ) $ (1,793,253 ) $ 988,234  The Company reported net loss applicable to Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. common stock of $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 (the "2017 Quarter") as compared to a net loss applicable to Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. common stock of $1.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 (the "2016 Quarter"). The drivers of the $1 million quarter-over-quarter change are discussed below.  Revenues  During the 2017 Quarter the Company and SOGS completed and installed its' first growing system order resulting in revenues of $1.3 million. In addition, the Company received $10,000 in licensing royalties as a result of its cavisonix(R) nutrient mixing equipment. Based on existing orders, the Company does not anticipate future quarters this year will generate revenue in this amount. However, if EDC completes its first growing facility and its initial tenant receives a license, EDC revenues will be material.  ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses  Equipment sales and licensing costs  During the 2017 Quarter the Company had equipment sales and licensing cost of $0.8 million relating to growing equipment sold.  Aftermarket Part and Product Costs  The costs associated with the sale of aftermarket products were $9,255 for the 2017 Quarter.  Royalty Costs  The Company had royalty non cash costs of $1,915 related to depreciation of the cavisonix(R) nutrient mixing equipment.  Salaries and Employee Benefits  The decrease in salaries employee benefits of approximately $0.3 million was primarily the result of a reduction in stock based compensation as the majority of the options are vested as of March 31, 2017.  Administrative and Selling  The Company had approximately $50,000 decrease in administrative and selling expensed for the 2017 Quarter. This was primarily the result of no longer having the Ecosphere Mining office in Park City, UT, a decrease in travel related expenses and marketing expenses.  Professional Fees  The $0.4 million decrease in professional fees for the 2017 Quarter was due to the reduction in consulting and legal fees. During the 2016 Quarter, the Company issued SOGS common stock to a consultant of the Company. The consultant received 6,000,000 shares of SOGS common stock. The shares were valued at $0.0468 per share (contemporaneous cash sales price) or $277,103.  Depreciation and Amortization  The Company had a decrease of $23,634 in depreciation and amortization for the 2017 Quarter as a result of certain disposals and fixed asset sales occurring in 2016.  Research and Development  The $0.1 million increase in research and development for the 2017 Quarter was primarily the result of the field operation in Washington State and the further development of various growing equipment, including the latest addition to the Company's product line, LED lighting.  Bad Debt  The Company had no bad debt expense for the 2017 Period as compared to $3,643 for the 2016 Period.  Loss from Operations  Loss from operations for the 2017 Quarter was $0.4 million compared to loss from operations of $1.6 million for the 2016 Quarter. See discussion above under "Revenues," "Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses" for details.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the 2017 Quarter increased $0.1 million primarily due to an increase in accrued interest related to convertible notes and notes payable.  Debt Extinguishment  The Company had no debt extinguishment for the 2017 Period as compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of $120,310 for the 2016 Period. For the 2016 Period, the Company had convertible debt modifications that were accounted for as debt extinguishment.  ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Change in Fair Value of Derivative Instruments  The Company had a change in fair value of derivative instruments of $40,014 for the 2017 Period, based upon the estimated fair value and reduction of principal due to conversions.  Net Loss Applicable to Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary  Net loss applicable to noncontrolling interest in our Ecosphere Mining, LLC and Sea of Green Systems, Inc. consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries was $69,835.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES A summary of our cash flows is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Unaudited) Net cash used in operating activities $ (885,499) $ (551,593 ) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (173,461) $ 42,395 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,047,733 $ 511,249  2017 Period  Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $0.9 million for the 2017 Quarter. For the 2017 Quarter, cash used in operating activities of $0.9 million resulted from the net loss applicable to Ecosphere common stock of $0.8 million and was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in inventory resulting in the sale of growing equipment during the 2017 Quarter, a $0.5 million increase in accrued expenses and $0.1 million in amortization of discounts on notes payable.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the 2017 Quarter. The Company had additions to property and equipment in connection with the construction of the Company's Cannatech Agriculture Center in Washington State.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $1 million for the 2017 Quarter. The Company received proceeds of approximately $0.5 million in connection with the issuance of a convertible note payable and related party note payable. In addition, the Company received $0.5 million in proceeds from debt type investment classified as an obligation secured by revenues in connection with an investment in the Company's subsidiary, Ecosphere Development Company, LLC, where the investor receives a certain percentage interest in a future revenue stream.  2016 Period  Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $0.6 million for the 2016 Quarter. For the 2016 Quarter, cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million resulted from the net loss applicable to Ecosphere common stock of $1.8 million and was partially offset by $0.7 million in stock based compensation, the increase in accrued expenses of $0.3 million, the increase in customer deposits of $0.1 million and a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.1 million in connection with issuance of SOGS common stock as consideration for the extension of debt.  Investing Activities  Net cash provided by investing activities was 42,395 for the 2016 Quarter. The Company sold mining equipment for cash proceeds of $50,000; this was partially offset by payment of patent costs and minimal additions to property, plant and equipment.  ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  Financing Activities  The Company's net cash provided by financing activities of $0.5 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable and warrants of $0.6 million and proceeds from the issuance of a related party note payable of $37,552, which was partially offset by repayments of bank overdraft fees, related party notes payable, vehicle and equipment financing and capital lease obligations.  Liquidity  As of May 15, 2017, Ecosphere had cash on hand of approximately $60,000. Due to the nature of its technology licensing business model, Ecosphere presently does not have any regularly recurring revenue. Management believes that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this Report. To support its operations, the Company has a number of plans to monetize its intellectual property, which is described below.  In order to stay operational, the Company's principal lender has continued to advance funds to the Company on an as needed basis. During 2016, he has lent the Company $1.9 million represented by a secured promissory note and convertible notes that are convertible at $0.115 per share and due in December 2017, these notes are secured by a variety of security interests on intellectual property and other assets of the Company. In addition, the Company's principal lender lent the Company and SOGS $500,000 during 2017. Until the Company can generate sufficient working capital to begin to repay this indebtedness and other indebtedness, this lender has rights, which are superior to the Company's shareholders as well as other creditors.  The Company is working on a number of initiatives which, if consummated can provide liquidity.  �  As a result of the recently announced SOGS product and services line, the Company and SOGS have begun discussions with multiple, commercial licensed growers that the Company expects could generate significant contracts and liquidity for the Company moving forward.  �  The Company is currently evaluating multiple opportunities to take SOGS public in order to provide liquidity for its shareholders. Assuming that SOGS is able to raise capital and become publicly reporting, it will pay Ecosphere $0.8 million of proceeds. In addition, Ecosphere will receive ongoing monthly management fees from SOGS.  �  During the summer of 2017, the Company expects to complete Phase 1 of its Cannatech Agriculture Center in Washington State if the Company can raise approximately $1 million. The Company expects for the business model of EDC to generate significant monthly, recurring, long-term revenue for the shareholders of Ecosphere and is a potential source of liquidity. The Company and EDC expect to replicate this business model, not only in Washington State, but in locations throughout the United States that are geographically, politically and economically well positioned.  �  The Company and EDC are seeking to raise the remaining $0.6 million balance of an offering of a percentage of EDC Phase 1 revenues generated in connection with the Washington Cannatech Agriculture Center project.  �  The Company continues to have ongoing discussions with potential strategic partners and licensees of its multi-patented and proven Ozonix(R) and Ecos PowerCube(R) technologies. The Company also continues to engage in numerous pilots and demonstrations to demonstrate the effectiveness of its Ozonix(R) technology, when conventional water treatment methods can't effectively compete.  Management is uncertain whether it will have liquidity for the next 12 months. Ecosphere plans to continue monetizing its intellectual property, and has identified the following liquidity sources that it expects to realize over the next three years:  �  Ecosphere is actively marketing exclusive and non-exclusive licensing opportunities for sale to strategic, well positioned partners that wish to bring our patented Ozonix(R) and Ecos PowerCube(R) technologies to specific industries in their respective countries and regions of the world. Ecosphere is providing a pilot to a customer that if successful has the ability to provide significant cash to Ecosphere. Management expects this will result in similar realization of the value that has been realized by the development and sale of the global energy rights for its Ozonix(R) technology to FNES. Ecosphere owns 100% of the global rights to its patented Ozonix(R) technology for all non-energy related applications, including but not limited to food and beverage, industrial, marine and municipal wastewater treatment, and any other industry in which water is treated with conventional liquid chemicals. Ecosphere also owns 100% of the global right to its patented Ecos PowerCube(R) technology for all industries and applications worldwide.  ECOSPHERE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  �  Ecosphere's business model revolves upon the licensing of its intellectual property to strategic customers and partners around the world that are well positioned and capitalized to bring Ecosphere's patented technologies to their respective industries and countries. Additionally, Ecosphere has its own in-house design, engineering and manufacturing facilities to support customers and licensees that choose to not manufacture Ecosphere's patented technologies themselves. In addition to the various licensing opportunities that are available for its patented Ozonix(R) and Ecos PowerCube(R) technologies globally, the Company's 30.6% interest in FNES is also available for sale to strategic buyers.  Management believes that the realization of any of the above events will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. Historically in the 18 years since inception, Ecosphere often has had liquidity problems but it has always found financing and new business to support its operations. Management believes that it will do so again although no assurances can be given. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  In addition to needing capital to support its operations, Ecosphere has all of its convertible notes payable, notes payable and related party notes payable due in December 2017. Please see Risk Factors concerning our ability to continue as a going concern and complete present equipment orders contained in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  For information on related party transactions and their financial impact, see Note 11 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  Research and development costs during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $131,504 and $44,066.  RECENTLY ISSUES ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report includes forward-looking statements including statements relating to our liquidity, our ability to pay or extend our debt, completion of the EDC Phase 1 Cannatech Center, the possibility of SOGS generating significant revenue and/or going public, opportunities for Ozonix(R) and the Ecos PowerCube(R) in other markets.
