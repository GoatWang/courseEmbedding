About American Railcar Industries, Inc.










1864

                            The Milton Car Works was formed in Milton, Pennsylvania by Murray,
                            Dougal & Company. A year later, the Milton Car Works began delivering some of the world’s
                            first tank cars. Designed by Amos Densmore, this unique conveyance consisted of two wood stave barrels mounted on a flat car.
                            The Densmore tank car ushered in a new era for the railroads and a new industry that 129 years later would become American Railcar Industries, Inc.
                        









1899

                            With a capital of $60,000,000, the Milton Car Works and 12 other railcar builders lead by William Keeny Bixby of
                            Missouri Car and Foundry formed our predecessor company, the American Car and Foundry Company (AC&F, later shortened to ACF).
                            Thus began our history of progress, leadership and innovation in rail car design and manufacturing. Among many of its proud achievements,
                            ACF lays claim to building the first all-steel passenger car for New York City's pioneer subway, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company
                            followed by the sale of more than 100 motor and trailer subway cars for London's famous Underground.
                            By 1906, ACF had steel shops at St. Louis, Missouri; Detroit, Michigan; Berwick, Pennsylvania; Huntington, West Virginia and Madison, Illinois.
                        









1917

                            Shippers Car Line began operation as a tank car leasing company then acquired by ACF in 1927. ACF played an active role in both World Wars,
                            producing for the Allies in World War I a diversity of products like artillery gun mounts and ammunition, field kitchens, pack saddles, submarine chasers,
                            cloth shrinking machines and rollers, and even wooden tent pegs. During World War II, ACF built army tanks, aircraft tail assemblies, artillery shells,
                            armor plate, and hospital cars. Until the end of World War I, ACF's Wilmington plant produced boats for the U.S Navy then switched production to
                            luxury wooden yachts, many of which still exist.
                        











1922

                            ACF expanded into the automotive industry when it acquired Carter Carburetor Corporation of St. Louis.
                            This began a long period of diversification and expansion into bus and street car manufacturing highlighted by acquisitions of Fageol Motors Co,
                            the Hall-Scott Motor Car Company and J. G. Brill Company. By 1954, the corporation's interests had become so diversified that the name was changed to ACF Industries,
                            Inc. ACF produced its last passenger railcar in 1959. American Railcar Industries, Inc. has its headquarters in
                            Saint Charles, Missouri outside of Saint Louis on the grounds of American Car and Foundry’s original manufacturing center circa 1899.
                        










1985

                            Jackson Manufacturing, a fabrication, machining, and railcar component supplier was established by ACF.
                            Today, ARI Jackson’s focus is supplying quality OEM railcar parts for our railcars and customers.
                        










1988

                            Corbitt Manufacturing, an aluminum foundry was purchased by ACF to produce components for our pressure differential hopper cars and our hopper car
                            outlets.
                        










1989

                            Southwest Steel Casting Company, a steel casting foundry in Longview, TX was acquired by ACF. As a diversified foundry,
                            it supplied our car body castings as well as products to the mining, construction and oil field markets in which it still operates today.
                        









1994

                            American Railcar Industries, Inc. was formed from the acquisition of railcar component manufacturing and railcar maintenance assets from ACF Industries.
                            At that time, the manufacturing base was focused on supplying parts and components to rail and non-rail related industries.
                            The Kennett Manufacturing plant was also launched this year as a fabrication and welded railcar sub-assembly supplier.
                            The railcar maintenance assets have been utilized by ARI as railcar services facilities.
                        








1995

                            ARI opened a freight car assembly factory in Paragould, AR being the first of two major railcar assembly plants in our manufacturing network.
                        









1999

                            ARI added a second assembly plant to produce tank cars in Marmaduke, AR.
                            Both of our assembly facilities were custom designed to produce high quality railcars while also providing efficiency and flexibility in operations.
                        









2005

                            ARI acquired from ACF its one-third ownership interest in Ohio Castings to increase our supply alternatives for heavy castings, couplers, and yokes.
                        









2006

                            ARI became publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ARII and continued expansions at our Paragould &
                            Marmaduke facilities.
                        

                            We further expanded our railcar sub assembly and small components manufacturing capabilities through the acquisition of Custom Steel, Inc.
                            Custom Steel operates a facility located adjacent to our facility in Kennett, MO that we have successfully added into our railcar sub assembly group.
                            This facility produces value-added fabricated steel components that primarily support our railcar manufacturing operations.
                        









2008

                            To support demanding quality requirements as we continue to grow, ARI added two additional component supply operations:
                            a wheel and axle assembly shop and tank head press.
                        









2009

                            Our joint venture axle and manufacturing facility, Axis, LLC began operations in Paragould, AR. Paint and lining railcar repair shop expansions were opened at our Sarnia & Longview locations.
                        









2011

                            ARI began railcar leasing operations primarily focusing on covered hopper cars and tank cars.
                        









2014

                            ARI further expanded our railcar repair capabilities with a new repair facility in Brookhaven, MS.

ST. CHARLES, Mo., June  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Railcar Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARII) (“ARI” or the “Company”) is excited to announce that it has begun managing its railcar leasing business in-house. The sale of its former lease fleet manager, American Railcar Leasing LLC (ARL), to SMBC Rail Services LLC was completed on June 1, 2017. ARI will now be able to serve its customers with a complete suite of products and services, including ARI-built railcars for direct sale and lease, in-house lease fleet management, railcar and industrial components, and railcar repair services. In planning for this endeavor, ARI has increased its workforce, including by adding staffing to internally manage its own lease fleet and increasing its sales and marketing staff. ARI promoted internal ARI resources, recruited talent from external companies with important rail experience, and hired certain key ARL sales and lease personnel including John O’Bryan as Chief Commercial Officer to lead the team.  The Company expects to continue to build out its lease management, sales and marketing team. Over the past several years, ARI has grown its lease fleet to more than 12,000 railcars. ARI’s commitment to building its leasing business is strong and will continue in the future. In the first quarter of 2017, more than half of ARI’s railcar production and shipments were for lease. Furthermore, ARI’s order backlog of railcars as of March 31, 2017, included 1,199 railcars to be added to the lease fleet in 2017 and beyond. “We want everyone to know that ‘it’s all here’ at ARI, and we are excited by this opportunity to further enhance our capabilities,” said Jeff Hollister, President and CEO of ARI. “The addition of in-house lease fleet management staff and an increase in our sales force will help to further enhance ARI’s business model of offering solutions to our customers of railcar products and services over the entire railcar life cycle. This will provide us additional flexibility and more tools that we expect will help us continue to grow our business. ” ARI’s heritage covers many years with leadership in all aspects of railcar manufacturing, innovation, creative leasing solutions, and railcar repair services. “It’s all here” highlights ARI’s ability to provide railcar solutions for all of our customers’ needs. “We are excited to focus on providing a seamless relationship between ARI and our customers,” said Mr. Hollister. “These events give us an opportunity to better understand our customer’s needs and build deeper relationships. As always, our goal is to listen to our customers, develop solutions to meet their requirements, and deliver high-quality products and services.” About American Railcar Industries, Inc.

History[edit]
ARI was formed in 1994 as a subsidiary of ACF Industries (ACF)), which had been leasing railcars since 1923.[6] s At that time ARI manufactured components for railcars, and also provided painting, repair and fleet management services. By 1999, the company was manufacturing both hopper and tanker cars.
In 2004 ARI formed a subsidiary company, American Railcar Leasing. This new company in turn acquired, via a series of transfer transactions between the related companies, the railcars and related leases from ACF_Industries.[7]
In 2006, ARI expanded by purchasing Custom Steel, a railcar parts manufacturer which had been owned by Steel industries.[8][9]
In 2009, the company reincorporated in North Dakota to take advantage of new North Dakota Publicly Traded Corporations Act.[10]
American Railcar Leasing[edit]
In 2014, ARL owns over 25,000 tank and covered hopper cars (with their two most common reporting marks being ACFX and SHPX) and serves the petroleum, chemical, food, agriculture, fertilizer and plastic pellet markets. In 2006 this amounted to more than 10% of the lease cars in the United States.[8][11]
The tank cars are used for a variety of liquid and liquified gas commodities such as vegetable oils, asphalt, various chemicals, LPGs and petroleum products. ARL's covered hopper cars are used for transporting commodities such as grains, plastic pellets, flour, sugar and various minerals.[12]
ARL is headquartered in St. Charles, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. They have five sales offices located in St. Charles, Missouri, Pointe-Claire, QC, Rochelle Park, NJ, Hinsdale, IL, and The Woodlands, TX.

In 2006 this amounted to more than 10% of the lease cars in the United States.[8][11]
The tank cars are used for a variety of liquid and liquified gas commodities such as vegetable oils, asphalt, various chemicals, LPGs and petroleum products. ARL's covered hopper cars are used for transporting commodities such as grains, plastic pellets, flour, sugar and various minerals.[12]
ARL is headquartered in St. Charles, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. They have five sales offices located in St. Charles, Missouri, Pointe-Claire, QC, Rochelle Park, NJ, Hinsdale, IL, and The Woodlands, TX.
