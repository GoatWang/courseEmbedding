Industry Executive Michael E. Angelina to Lead Insurance Program



        Wednesday, April 4, 2012      



 

Michael E. Angelina
 

PHILADELPHIA (April 4, 2012) - Chief actuary & risk officer of Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. Michael E. Angelina will assume the role of executive director of the Academy of Risk Management and Insurance at Saint Joseph's University on April 1. Angelina is an accomplished executive with more than 25 years of experience in the field.
Joseph A. DiAngelo Jr., Ed.D. '70, dean of the University's Haub School of Business, says Angelina's background brings a unique perspective for risk management and insurance majors.
"Michael will be a tremendous asset to our program," says DiAngelo. "As an industry professional, he has experience in many aspects of insurance and reinsurance operations. His addition to the program will continue to advance Saint Joseph's premier insurance program."
Angelina has been chief actuary & risk officer of Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. since June 2005 and serves on its executive team. He began his insurance career with CIGNA in the workers compensation and actuarial research units. He has over 25 years of professional experience as a practicing actuary. Prior to joining Endurance, Angelina was a principal and head of the Philadelphia office of the consulting actuarial firm Tillinghast Towers Perrin. He is an associate of the Casualty Actuarial Society and a member of the American Academy of Actuaries.
In addition to his corporate experience, Angelina is also co-author of an industry-wide asbestos actuarial study and participated in the development of the 2003 FAIR Act (proposed Federal asbestos legislation).
"I am looking forward to interacting with local firms to provide internships and employment for our students while further increasing the visibility of the Academy," says Angelina of his new role. "Through my past and current interactions, I've been very impressed by Saint Joseph's program. I am committed to working toward its continued success."
Established in 2007 within the Haub School of Business, the Risk Management and Insurance program has achieved rapid growth. With support from insurance executives comprising its advisory board, the program awards $75,000 in scholarships annually; has a chapter of Gamma Iota Sigma, a professional fraternity of risk management and insurance students; is one of 21 schools with a Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) collegiate chapter; and is ranked No. 11 by U.S.News & World Report's "America's Best Colleges" among similar programs nationally.




Background
Founded in 1851 in the Jesuit tradition of academic excellence, Saint Joseph’s University is a top-ranked Catholic University that provides a rigorous, student-centered education. With a total enrollment of 8,500 undergraduate and graduate students, SJU offers a wide-array of academic programs designed so that each graduate enters the world with a competitive resume and global perspective. This is achieved through intense academic study led by thought-leading faculty scholars, a comprehensive campus experience and robust study abroad, service-learning, internship and co-op programs. Upon graduation, nearly 100 percent of students are employed, pursuing advanced degrees or volunteering in prestigious service programs. A member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, SJU offers 20 Division I intercollegiate men’s and women’s sports. SJU alumni – over 60,000 strong - provide a powerful network that spans the globe.
