Bellrock Controls Financing
Bellrock Controls, Inc., Corporation just released form D about $1.50 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Bellrock Controls was able to sell $200,000 so far. That is 13.33 % of the fundraising. The total private offering amount was $1.50 million. The financing form was filed on 2015-12-22. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. The fundraising still has about $1.30 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Bellrock Controls is based in New Jersey. The company’s business is Other Technology. The SEC form was filed by Alfred F Fasola Jr President and Chief Executive Officer. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 385 Clinton Avenue, Wyckoff, Nj, New Jersey, 07481. Alfred F. Fasola, Jr. is the related person in the form and it has address: 385 Clinton Avenue, Wyckoff, Nj, New Jersey, 07481. Link to Bellrock Controls Filing: 000165990015000002.
Analysis of Bellrock Controls Offering
On average, companies in the Other Technology sector, sell 85.80 % of the total offering amount. Bellrock Controls sold 13.33 % of the offering. The fundraising is still open. The average investment offering size for companies in the Other Technology industry is $1.54 million. The offering was 87.01 % smaller than the average of $1.54 million. Of course this should not be interpreted as negative. Startups raise funds for different reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this offering is set at $100000. If you know more about the reasons for the fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Bellrock Controls Also
The Form D signed by Alfred F Fasola Jr might help Bellrock Controls, Inc.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

Bellrock Controls, a New Jersey-based health care technology company, will open an office in Pittsburgh, said Dr. Nir Kossovsky, president of Bellrock's Health Care division.
Pittsburgh "is a true hotbed of intelligence-based technology and it's a great environment for health care," said Kossovsky, a University of Pittsburgh alumnus. He added: "This turns out to be a great city to find the right kind of people with the right skill sets and attitudes."




 


Bellrock Controls' first product, called Network Intelligence Rx, is a cloud-based software program to help physicians access patient information and improve decision-making. It is expected to go live July 1.




"Bellrock Controls is essentially a quality-control solution baked into an intelligence platform," said Kossovsky, who also co-founder of Steel City Re, a Pittsburgh-headquartered corporate reputation measurement and risk management company.
Kossovsky aims to have 10 to 15-person team occupying a brick-and-mortar Pittsburgh office by the end of 2017, with other employees still based in New Jersey. In total, Bellrock employs about 30 people in New Jersey, Connecticut and elsewhere.
