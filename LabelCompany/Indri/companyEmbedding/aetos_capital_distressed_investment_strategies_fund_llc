Overview
Aetos Capital (“Aetos”) provides customized portfolio solutions to institutional investors.  Our investment professionals bring deep experience across a broad range of asset classes including hedge funds, public and private equity, credit and real estate.  As dedicated fiduciaries, we employ a disciplined approach to asset allocation, manager selection, and portfolio construction that emphasizes comprehensive risk management at every step.
At Aetos, we are committed to providing our clients with exceptional service that is highly customized to meet their long-term investment goals.  To this end, we remain a wholly independently-owned, SEC-registered investment advisor1 with offices in New York and California. Since inception, we have grown steadily and organically to become the multi-billion dollar firm we are today.
______________
1 SEC registration does not imply in any manner whatsoever that Aetos has been sponsored, recommended, or approved, or that its abilities or qualifications have in any respect been passed upon by the United States or any agency or any office thereof.


















Approach | Aetos Capital



















































Approach
Investment Process





Building portfolios that seek to preserve capital and maximize alpha
At Aetos, we take a differentiated approach to identifying the fundamental sources of alpha, driven by our understanding of the nature of market inefficiencies and the potential rewards for providing liquidity.  We leverage this understanding to construct portfolios that are designed to preserve capital and maximize alpha generation over a wide range of market environments.
Our approach is both long-term and tactical.  We make core allocations to our highest-conviction managers that we believe are best-equipped to navigate through market cycles.  At the same time, our research team identifies developments in financial and economic conditions that create near-term investment opportunities, allowing us to make adjustments to our clients’ portfolios in the context of their longer-term goals.

Core Principles

Advantage
Below are four key factors that we believe differentiate Aetos from our peers:
Fiduciary Perspective
Aetos’ Co-Founder Anne Casscells brings a unique perspective to investing, having previously served as Chief Investment Officer of Stanford Management Company.  Our senior investment professionals also average more than 20 years of hedge fund investing experience as fiduciaries, in addition to deep capital markets expertise across asset classes, securities, and investment strategies.
Knowledge Sharing/“Extension of Staff”
At Aetos, we pride ourselves on the high level of knowledge transfer with our clients’ investment staffs, whereby individuals have access to senior Aetos investment leadership.  In addition to portfolio details, we share economic and market insights across traditional and alternative strategies, as well as provide training and education on best practices across areas such as strategy allocation, investment and operational due diligence, and risk management.
Significant Investor in Hedge Funds and Other Alternative Investment Strategies
Aetos is large enough to access the most sought-after hedge funds, yet nimble enough to identify unique alpha sources and make investments of meaningful size.  Our size and industry stature often enable us to negotiate favorable terms on behalf of clients.
Customized Investment Solutions
Creating customized portfolios is in Aetos’ DNA, starting with our first portfolio in 2001.  Currently, approximately 80% of our current assets under management are in highly customized mandates, including multi-strategy and specialty portfolios structured according to our clients’ investment needs.

Investment Philosophy and Process                                               
Aetos Capital combines excellence in research, risk management, manager due     
diligence, and portfolio construction to increase the probability of consistent 
and uncorrelated investment results. We believe in a disciplined and            
fundamentally based investment process where risk management is integrated into 
all aspects of the investment process and evaluated in each of its four         
constituent parts - portfolio management, operational, portfolio and strategy   
risk.                                                                           
Our meticulous manager selection process reflects nearly three decades of       
collective hedge fund of funds experience, which is combined with our deep      
capital markets expertise. At Aetos Capital, we:                                
o maintain a bias towards                                                       
fundamentally oriented managers and complement experienced and established firms
with emerging talent                                                            
o focus on managers with demonstrated investment and business skill, deep       
organizations, sustainable performance and                                      
consistent risk profiles                                                        
o determine the allocation to hedge fund strategies and managers by             
merging quantitative and qualitative factors, using mean-variance               
optimization tools, reviewing correlations among managers and                   
incorporating position limits, ranges and liquidity constraints                 
o invest with managers who provide portfolio information and access to          
principals, affording a clear understanding of each manager's                   
investment strategy, competitive advantage, and underlying drivers of           
return                                                                          
o adjust asset allocations among absolute return strategies within our          
portfolios based upon our evaluation of the market environment,                 
opportunity set and risk profile of each strategy                               
o perform ongoing due diligence on the individual managers                      
Aetos Capital's portfolio construction process is flexible and is designed to   
accommodate client-specific return and volatility targets. We offer a tailored  
range of services including asset allocation analysis, manager selection,       
program monitoring, direct investment with underlying managers, and custom      
reporting.

*Absolute return investing involves substantial risks, including risk of loss of
invested capital. Absolute return investments are typically made through        
investments in illiquid, unregulated investment funds that employ sophisticated 
investment techniques, often involving derivatives and leverage, in a wide range
of financial instruments and markets. These investments entail a wide variety of
risks, which remain substantial notwithstanding the risk management practices we
employ in selecting and monitoring funds we invest in. Prospective investors    
should consider these risks and the charges and expenses of the funds carefully 
before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information: a free

prospectus carefully before investing.

AETOS CAPITAL

Absolute return investing involves substantial risks, including the risk of loss of invested capital.��Absolute return investments are typically made through investments in illiquid, unregulated
investment funds that employ sophisticated investment techniques, often involving derivatives and leverage, in a wide range of financial instruments and markets.��These investments entail a wide variety of risks, which remain substantial notwithstanding
the risk management practices we employ in selecting and monitoring the funds in which we invest.��Potential investors in absolute return vehicles are urged to familiarize themselves with these risks before investing.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

We partner with clients to provide tailored
solutions across the spectrum of hedge fund strategies 

We 
integrate risk management into all aspects of the investment process focusing on manager, operational, portfolio, and strategy/investment risk  

We follow an investment process which combines excellence in research, risk management, manager due diligence,
and portfolio construction to increase the probability of consistent and uncorrelated investment results 

We maintain a bias towards fundamentally oriented
 managers and complement experienced and established firms with emerging talent. 

We focus on managers with demonstrated
investment and business skill, deep organizations, sustainable performance, and consistent risk profiles. 

We determine the allocation to hedge fund strategies and managers merging 
quantitative and qualitative factors, using mean-variance optimization tools, reviewing correlations among managers and incorporating position limits, ranges and liquidity constraints
 

We invest with managers who provide portfolio transparency
and access to principals affording a clear understanding of each manager�s investment strategy, competitive advantage, and underlying drivers of returns

Traditional active management has many drawbacks  

Short-selling constraints  

Poor incentive structure promotes asset-gathering  

Paying fees for beta exposure  

Best sources of alpha do not always coincide with ideal asset classes for the portfolio 

Essential idea behind portable alpha: separate the beta component of returns from the alpha component
 

Realize beta through indexed exposure (low cost) and alpha through actively managed hedge funds  

Provides greater flexibility 

Increases likelihood of realizing positive alpha in portfolio 

Only a small % of active management represents true alpha, i.e. skill-based stock selection. 
 

Due to tracking error constraints, managers use most of the portfolio to replicate the market.��Market cap weightings of benchmarks further restrict managers� ability to add value
by underweighting expensive stocks.�� 

Since the advent of futures and swaps, the market return can be accessed for a very low cost and there is no need to devote most of the portfolio to replicating the market.��Instead it
can be used to earn more alpha.��

 Make cash work harder � earn alpha

Most equity investors try to earn alpha by overweighting and underweighting stocks relative to the index 

In diversified portfolios designed to limit divergence from the index return (i.e. tracking error constrained), most of the cash is used to create a market tracking portfolio (beta replication)
and little is used for active management (alpha generation) 

By understanding that cash is not necessary to get beta, a more optimal approach becomes possible and the cash can be redeployed to earn more alpha 

Investors can replicate index returns by combining futures or swaps with a risk free investment (i.e. LIBOR) 

If investors can earn more than the risk free rate on their cash, a portable alpha strategy becomes feasible

During the period from September 2002 through April 2007, it is likely that the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio allocations to the Aetos Capital Funds would have differed from the allocations on April 1, 2007, and the performance shown is not necessarily representative of the performance that would have been achieved had the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio been in existence during the entire period.

	 1 Allocations are subject to change over time and exclude cash.2 Performance figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2016 are of the Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio and are net of investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return, respectively. The performance figures shown may include returns that are preliminary, unaudited, and estimated based on the most recent information provided by underlying fund managers, and are subject to change. For performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an investor redeems each December 31 and invests each January 1. The Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio is a model portfolio/asset allocation program. This Portfolio may not reflect an investor’s actual portfolio as actual portfolios reflect each investor’s own objectives and risk tolerances. The performance of the Portfolio is based on the weighted performance over the respective periods of the Aetos Capital SEC-Registered Funds, weighted according to the allocations in effect during the periods. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

AETOS CAPITAL REAL ESTATE, LP AND AFFILIATES
Aetos Capital Real Estate, LP (ACRE) is an independent investment management firm that focuses exclusively on real estate investment opportunities in Asia, principally Japan and Greater China. The ACRE business was founded by Scott Kelley in 2001. To date, ACRE has sponsored four Aetos Capital Asia (ACA) funds with total equity capital commitments of approximately $3.8 billion. Since inception, the ACA funds have acquired more than $10 billion of real estate and real estate-related investments in Japan, Greater China and South Korea. ACRE and its subsidiaries have a team of approximately 25 professionals across three offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and New York.





Our team has extensive experience in many forms of real estate investing, including single asset and property portfolio purchases, real estate company acquisitions, privatizations of listed real estate companies, acquisitions of distressed debt and investments in development projects. We believe that our platform enables us to source transactions on attractive terms, add value through active asset management and, when appropriate, partner with “best of breed” developers.
Our value-added strategies include investing capital to reposition assets, launching creative and aggressive leasing efforts, optimizing asset performance by reducing expenses, refinancing debt on more advantageous terms and restructuring and refocusing companies that derive value primarily from real estate and related assets.
When we believe we have maximized value, we typically consider a variety of exit structures. We have consummated the sale of more than $5 billion in assets utilizing strategies including individual asset sales, portfolio sales, company sales in the M&A market and asset sales to J-REITs, as well as the launch of a portfolio company’s J-REIT.

Strategies for Investing in Uncertain Markets
In an uncertain market, one thing is certain: Market declines are an inevitable part of investing.
These 5 investment strategies can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture.












Stay Calm and Get Professional Advice

Avoid making quick moves on your own, as tempting as it may be. Instead, meet with your financial professional and share your concerns.
Resist making decisions on the basis of single events.
Re-examine your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate.




 






Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio

Work with your financial professional to spread your risks.
Consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds. Additionally, keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet short-term needs. 
Include funds that invest outside the United States. Non-U.S. markets often move in their own market cycles.
Diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit, but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility.


Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio




 






Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times















Avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news.
Instead of fearing a down market, view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices.
Consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter, a strategy known as dollar cost averaging. You won’t have to guess which way the market is going. You also won't risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market. (Please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.)


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times




 






Invest for Income

Consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments.
Income-producing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market. After all, a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling. 


Invest for Income




 






Avoid Jumping In and Out of the Market

Successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two near-perfect actions: getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time. As a result, investors typically end up buying high and selling low.
One reason it’s difficult: A bear market is not usually characterized by a straight-line decline in stock prices. Instead, it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern.

 Staying the Course 
 


















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 


Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
