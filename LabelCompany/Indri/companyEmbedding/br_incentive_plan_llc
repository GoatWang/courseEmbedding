What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

 Examples of Management Incentive Plans | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  Examples of Management Incentive Plans  by Oneil Williams        Recognizing managers for outstanding performance can help drive stellar business results. Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Plans] | Incentive Plans for Employees 2 [Long-Term Incentive Plans] | Examples of Long-Term Incentive Plans 3 [Sales] | Sales Incentive Structure 4 [Incentive Plans] | What Are Incentive Plans?    Managers are the employees tasked with helping your company to accomplish its strategic goals and objectives. The incentive plans you use to motivate your management team will likely play a role in your business's growth and success. A wide variety of incentive plans exist to help managers stay focused and driven. Consider a combination of incentive plans that will create a rich compensation package to aid with retention and achievement.        Pay-for-Performance APQC, a knowledge management organization, has used research to determine that offering performance-based pay at all levels within an organization is a rewards and retention best practice. The pay-for-performance model normally consists of a base rate of pay coupled with a variable rate of pay that is specifically tied to an individual's performance. Top-performing managers are usually quite receptive to this model, because it establishes a clear link between individual performance and the achievement of company goals. You'll want to determine whether to focus on operating profit as a measurement or on non-financial indicators such as product quality, employee development or customer satisfaction when determining how to award variable pay. Stock Options As of 2011, more than 30,000 different stock option plans were being used by companies across the United States. Stock options are no longer an incentive offered exclusively to a company's elite executives, but one that multiple businesses now extended to managers and subordinates. Stock options are usually offered by an employer as an employee retention incentive. The idea is for the stock options to increase in value over a period of time so that the employee can sell the stocks at a profit once the designated waiting period has expired. This incentive can encourage managers to exceed performance goals with the expectation that this will positively impact the company's stock value. Gain-Sharing Gain-sharing incentive plans are designed to foster collaboration, involvement and an enhanced corporate culture. Even though this is an incentive plan that all employees may benefit from, your management team can play an instrumental role in fostering teamwork, productivity gains and the sharing of ideas that lead to improved organizational performance. Gain-sharing is not just focused on a company's bottom line, but on achieving increased operational performance along with positive employee attitudes. Companies that adopt this type of incentive plan are usually as concerned with the business environment or culture as much as the revenue or strategic goals. Recognition Organizations that are intensely focused on recognizing the achievements of front-line employees can sometimes forget to recognize the contributions that managers have on impacting performance. Mid-level managers may be especially overlooked because the work they perform may not be as visible to senior management. Like all other employees, your management team should be rewarded both publicly and privately for performance that exceeds expectations. Recognition incentive plans can include perks such as trophies, gift certificates or extra vacation days.

"Incentive Compensation in Pharma Sales: Aligning People, Performance and Pay"

Study Overview
An effective incentive compensation plan for sales people is crucial for motivating and maintaining a successful sales force. This 44-slide presentation focuses on how leading pharmaceutical and biotech company leaders such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline structure and implement incentive programs. It is designed to assist other pharma and biotech executives in designing their own programs with the right mix of metrics, monetary and non-monetary rewards, fairness, timing and motivational power. It can also provide a framework and incentive areas to consider to those outside the pharma industry. 

Key Topic Areas
�	Monetary and Non-Monetary Rewards: Examples from Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline
�	Mentor Programs
�	Flexible Work Schedules
�	Incentive Pay for Specialist Physicians
�	Uncapped Incentives
�	Territory Optimization: Balancing Relationship Depth with Market Change
�	Enhancing Perceptions of Fairness
�	Quota Setting Process
�	Product Weighting and Detail Order
�	Portfolio Kicker for Reaching Quota on all Portfolio Products
�	Incentives and Performance Metrics
�      Promoting Teamwork

Sample Key Findings
�	Companies are moving away from “entitlement” cultures including across-the-board pay increases to more individual, pay-for-performance merit pay raises.
�	Higher level, more experienced reps hit their bonus targets at much higher rates than entry-level reps – showing the value of experience in performing above expectations.
�     An increasing percentage of companies reset quotas more than annually to offset their inability to forecast market and sales performance with high degrees of accuracy. 

Sample Metrics
�	Bonus percentages above targets segmented by experience levels
�	Percent of companies using prescription and sales data as quota-setting factors
�	Percent of companies using multi-variable Incentives
�	Percentage of performance targets reps must hit to receive a bonus
�	Frequency of distributing rewards
�	Percent of companies using teamwork in incentive pay
�	Percent of incentive plans focusing on specialist physicians
�    Percentage of companies with uncapped incentive plans

Methodology
This research was conducted on behalf of a client and studies mirrored sales organizations in nine pharma and biotech companies in 2000. Additional data was based on a 1999 survey by the Hay Group involving 75 pharma, biotech and oncology companies.

Management Compensation and Incentive Programs after Bankruptcy Reform
June 22, 2008
Bonnie Glantz Fatell & Michael B. Schaedle The Americas Restructuring and Insolvency Guide 2008/2009 The basic model for US corporate bankruptcy is to leave the debtor in possession during a Chapter 11 to achieve a successful reorganization, or in some instances a successful liquidation. Senior management and officers – those most knowledgeable about the business – continue to oversee the company, thereby ensuring continuity throughout the Chapter 11 process. However, when a company is in financial difficulty and may need respite from its creditors, there is a significant risk that key employees will jump ship and seek more reliable employment. How does a company in distress retain its senior executives and key personnel when their personal futures are as uncertain as that of the company? Moreover, it is widely recognized that distressed companies need to incentivize key employees properly to induce them to work with the company during the Chapter 11 to maximize value and hopefully turn the company around. 
The Law of Senior Management Retention and Incentives Before Reform: The Impact of Enron 
In the past, incentivizing key employees and senior management to remain with the company in return for a staying bonus was routine in a Chapter 11. Key employee retention programs (KERPs) were used to maximize employee buy-in to a company’s turnaround and recovery and became commonplace in modern Chapter 11 cases. A KERP often required a debtor’s use of property of its estate (ie, money) outside the ordinary course of its business, and therefore also required bankruptcy court approval under Section 363(b) of the US Bankruptcy Code. In order to have a KERP approved by the bankruptcy court, the debtor had to demonstrate that there was a “sound business reason” for the program and that it was fair and reasonable. This sort of corporate decision-making is usually supported by “a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was in the best interests of the company” (Brehm v Eisner, 746 A 2d 244, 264 n 66 (Del 2000)). Generally, bankruptcy courts did not and do not want to micromanage the company’s use of its property outside the ordinary course of its business, and therefore will defer to a debtor’s business judgment so long as there is a sound business purpose to justify the use in question. 
Before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (the ‘Bankruptcy Reform Act’) became effective in October 2005, KERPs complemented, modified or even replaced severance programs, annual incentive plans, consulting deals, pension plan modifications and bonus provisions in employment contracts for senior management, including insiders. KERPs enhanced ordinary compensation and bonus levels to those identified as key employees – arguably so that they would accept aligning their professional futures and reputations with a distressed company that had a higher-than-usual chance of failure. Not infrequently, KERPs were negotiated and proposed on the eve of the filing of a bankruptcy or promptly after the bankruptcy commenced. The bonuses were promised to senior management to induce them to stay with the company with assurance that the company’s officers would promptly seek court approval of the program. In reliance on the company’s promises, most key employees would work through the Chapter 11, anticipating a bonus for their loyalty. 
Prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, organized labor and creditors often argued that KERPs were unnecessary for senior management and officers and inequitable for a debtor’s total workforce given the sacrifices required of such workers in bankruptcy (eg, job losses and pension and wage concessions). It could be argued that, once the case is filed, senior management owed the debtor and its creditors a fiduciary duty to attempt to reorganize successfully without the inducement of enhanced compensation. Many contended that it was senior management’s failures that caused the company to file Chapter 11, and there was no justification for rewarding their actions. 
Nevertheless, in the years running up to bankruptcy reform, KERPs became common in complex Chapter 11 cases in the United States and were almost a market feature of executive compensation in a distressed context. More often than not, courts deferred to the debtor’s business judgment and the argument that without a retention plan employees would resign in droves, putting the future of the company in grave peril and the recoveries to creditors at risk. While some may have questioned the intent and merit of a bonus program that was proposed by the very insiders who would benefit personally from the program, the courts upheld companies’ decisions unless there was evidence that it was “so manifestly unreasonable that it could not be based upon sound business judgment, but only on bad faith, or whim or caprice” (In re Aerovox, 269 BR 74 (Bankr D Mass 2001)). 
Then, in the early part of this decade corporate executives in the high-profile cases WorldCom and Enron were found to have engaged in self dealing and criminal conduct, decimating companies, jobs and pensions – to the grave detriment of rank-and file employees. At the same time, mainly because of the various renowned corruption cases involving corporate officers, KERPs were characterized, fairly or unfairly, as a license to enable senior managers to cash in on corporate and labor market disasters for which they bore substantial responsibility. This perceived inequity caused Congress to enact Section 503(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, which places significant restrictions on KERPs. 
The Bankruptcy Code Now Severely Restricts the Ability to Make Retention or Severance Payments to Insiders 
The three subsections of Section 503(c) of the Bankruptcy Code: 

effectively prohibit retention programs for insiders in Chapter 11 reorganizations outside a plan; 
place limitations on severance payments to insiders; and 
establish standards for benefits for non-insider employees, provided that the transfers or obligations are outside the ordinary course of the company’s business and justified by the facts and circumstances of the case. 
Section 503(c) makes it almost impossible to create a KERP that directly pays stay or retention bonuses to insiders. Indeed, there are no reported decisions approving any such KERP after October 2005 (eg, see In re Dana Corp (‘Dana I’), 358 BR 567, 576 n 11 (Bankr SDNY 2006). 
In order to offer a retention bonus to an insider, the requirements of Section 503(c)(1) must be met and applied strictly. First, the debtor has to show that an insider has a pending job offer that exceeds the insider’s existing compensation package (inclusive of commissions, benefits, stock options and all wage equivalents or supplements). It then has to prove that the company would fail without the insider’s continued employment. Finally, no insider KERP can be approved unless non-management employees have benefited from a KERP in the same year, or unless the debtor has in place a KERP that benefited the insider in question in the previous calendar year. If the first two hurdles are overcome, the court must then apply a formulaic and conservative approach to ensure that the benefits for insiders are not substantially in excess of those provided to non-managerial employees. 
In effect, as a threshold matter an insider must have in hand a better paid job offer, presumably with a financially sound company. If that is the case, why would the insider choose the uncertainty of staying with a Chapter 11 debtor that may or may not reorganize, for a stay bonus that is subject to a formulaic cap and is likely to be less valuable than incentives available to the executive prepetition. The company then has to demonstrate that the insider’s exit will cause the company to fail – that is, that the insider is irreplaceable. This is an impossible burden for any company that uses professional managers for which a relevant labor market exists. These provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act accomplish Section 503(c)(1)’s intended objective, effectively precluding any debtor from making retention benefits available to insiders in a Chapter 11 case. 
In addition, Section 503(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code appears to prohibit severance payments to insiders unless the severance is part of an overall program applicable to the general workforce and the various plans relating to severance covering that workforce. In that case, the severance payments to insiders are capped at 10 times the amount actually paid to non-management employees in a given calendar year. 
Section 503(c)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code is a catch-all clause, intended to cover plans and programs that are outside the ordinary course of a debtor’s business and are not formally designed to retain insiders. While the section primarily seems to restate the old “sound business judgment” standard (Dana I, supra at 576-77; In re Nobex Corporation, Case No 05-20500 (MFW), nt at 86-87 (Bankr D Del, Jan 12, 2006)), it has been suggested that under Section 503(c) all compensation programs that can have a retentive effect with respect to insiders are subject to stricter scrutiny under Section 503(c)(3) than the pre-Bankruptcy Reform Act sound business judgment test (In re CEP Holdings, LLC, slip op, 2006 LEXIS 3305 at *2 (Bankr ND Ohio, Nov 28, 2006)). 
Overall, Section 503(c) of the Bankruptcy Code makes it much more difficult for a debtor to provide key employees with retention and performance incentives. Indeed, the only programs characterized as KERPs for insiders since the Bankruptcy Reform Act came into force have been some modest Section 503(c)(2) severance programs in middle-market debtor cases. In those instances the disparity between historical severance payments to insiders and the general workforce are not so excessive as to prohibit meeting the formula set out in Section 503(c)(2) (eg, see In re Flyi, Inc, Case No 05-20011 (MFW), nt at 14 (Bankr D Del, Jan 12 2006)). 
Incentive Plans Versus Retention Plans: Fact Sensitive Distinctions 
Due to the undoubted importance to a distressed company of incentivizing key employees to remain with the company and maximizing enterprise value or accomplishing a successful turnaround, debtors have been very creative in structuring programs that fall within the ambit of Section 503(c). The most common approach to tackling the business problem posed to debtors by Section 503(c) is to develop post petition compensation programs that offer insiders and other key employees incentives to create value (or to continue pre-petition programs that incentivize insiders and other senior managers). The basic concept is to require the creation of value for the estate as a condition to payment of compensation enhancements. Milestones have to be identified, including for example increased asset sale prices or enterprise value, increased cash and operating sales levels coupled with expense reductions, or successful negotiation and compromise of certain controversies. 
It has been argued that the existence of incentive programs creates an environment that is retentive in nature. Nevertheless, courts have consistently found that the prohibitions in Section 503(c)(1) are inapplicable to true incentive programs, irrespective of the retentive effect of such programs (Dana I, 351 BR at 103 – “I do not find that incentivizing plans which may have some components that arguably have a retentive effect, necessarily violate Section 503(c)’s requirements”; also see In re Calpine Corporation, Case No 05-60200 (BRL), nt at 84-85 (Bankr SDNY, Apr 26 2006) – incentives only paid where enterprise value increases and thus are not retention bonuses, but are performance based). 
The following are examples of incentive plans that have been approved by bankruptcy courts since the Bankruptcy Reform Act, irrespective of retentive effects and insider eligibility to participate in bonuses: 

As a result of a negotiation between the debtor and the creditors’ committee to resolve the committee’s objection to the debtor’s incentive program as originally proposed, the debtor compromised and agreed to pay its chief executive officer and vice president for finance and administration a percentage of sale proceeds realized, but only if the sale proceeds exceeded a floor established by an already negotiated stalking horse bid for the debtor’s assets (Nobex, slip op, 2006 Bankr LEXIS 417 at *6-8 (Bankr D Del, Jan 19 2006). 
Senior executives were permitted to receive a long-term incentive bonus if the debtor reached specific earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) levels up to an annual cap. The plan covered three years and was payable in a mix of currencies, including company stock over the term of the plan (In re Dana Corporation (‘Dana II’), 358 BR 567, 574, 584 (Bankr SDNY 2006)). 
Senior management and other tiers of key employee received bonuses equal to a sliding percentage of their base compensation if the debtor achieved certain levels of EBITDA for certain periods (In re Nellson Neutraceutical, Inc, 369 BR 787, 801-03 (Bankr D Del 2007)). 
Senior management was eligible to receive a rate able share of all or of 50 per cent of a quarterly bonus pool depending on the achievement on a quarter by quarter basis of: 

EBITDA levels, and 
certain other cash-flow benchmarks. Further, senior sales managers can receive bonuses based on percentages of base compensation if sales goals are met in a given quarter (In re Global Home Products, LLC, 369 BR 778, 785-86 (Bankr D Del 2007)). 
In the American Home Mortgage Case the Delaware Bankruptcy Court approved a plan offering critical employees (including an insider) familiar with the debtor’s construction and mortgage loan business incentive bonuses to negotiate and compromise certain loans successfully. The plan was properly characterized as a sale-related incentive plan and not a retention or severance plan for insiders. Accordingly, it was not governed by Sections 503(c)(1) or (c)(2). Since the stay or retention bonus provisions applied only to non- insiders, it was authorized under the catch-all Section 503(c)(3), as it was justified by a sound business purpose. 
However, the courts have refused to approve artificially low target completion bonuses and non-compete compensation for a chief executive officer as being effective retention bonuses prohibited by Section 503(c)(1) (see Dana I, 351 BR at 102). 
Ordinary Course Benefit and Performance Plans 
Some debtors have argued that longstanding bonus or pension plans are ordinary course business programs that are excluded from the ambit of Section 503(c)(3) because the goal and purpose of the plan is not the retention of insiders. Further, debtors have caused pension plans to be modified and assumed in ways that are favorable to senior management, claiming that the modifications are ordinary course and not in the nature of severance, and were neither conceived nor modified for a primarily retentive purpose. These approaches have met with some success: 

The Delaware court in Nellson Nutraceutical found that a longstanding bonus program based on driving EBITDA was in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business. Although the program, which was actually modified post petition to lower EBITDA triggers to ensure payment of some bonus pool, was available to senior management, the court found that the program was not designed to retain senior management in bankruptcy, but rather was designed, consistent with industry standards and the reasonable expectations of the debtor’s stakeholders regarding the debtor’s ordinary conduct of its business, to drive debtor cash flow. In this context, the court found both Sections 503(c)(1) and (3) inapplicable and the program, as modified, was supported by the debtor’s good-faith, reasonable business judgment (Nellson Nutraceutical, 369 BR at 801- 04). 
In Global Home Products the court held that a sales performance incentive program was an ordinary course business mechanism designed to incentivize performance in or out of bankruptcy, and therefore was not subject to the limits of Section 503(c) (Global Home Products, 369 BR at 786). 
Similarly, the court in Dana II (358 BR at 579-80) found that an annual incentive program was ordinary course and non-retentive, even though it had been modified just prior to bankruptcy. The court said that the program had “been a common component of compensation plans at Dana for the past fifty years and [did] not differ significantly from Dana’s prepetition practice” (id). 
The Dana II court also held that the assumption of pension plans for senior management upon emergence from bankruptcy was not governed by Section 503(c). Focusing on the facts that the senior employees had already vested pension benefits under relevant plans in part and that the pension plan assumption was tied to the company’s exit from bankruptcy and not to the employees’ retention by the firm, the court found that the purpose behind the pension assumption was not retentive in nature and that the pension modifications were customary and ordinary plan adjustments and not in the nature of severance (Dana II, 358 BR at 577-78). 
Other Key Issues Relating to Management Incentives: Insider Status and Source and Effect of Retentive Benefits 
The threshold question in evaluating an employee compensation enhancement program is how to define an ‘insider’. Courts have been fairly conservative in finding insider status (see CEP Holdings, slip op, 2006 LEXIS 3305 at *4 – insider status indicated where control is not indicated by title, but by organizational authority; In re Refco Inc, Case No 05-60006 (RDD), order approving implementation of key employee compensation program, at 1-2 (Bankr SDNY, Jan 18 2006) – focusing on level of control exercised by senior employees in a liquidation and determining that in light of the course of the liquidation and its requirements, such employees were no longer insiders and the compensation program could be evaluated under a business judgment test). Other courts have addressed whether the title of an employee is enough to deem him or her an insider. For example, many companies freely designate employees as vice presidents. In a recent case the court required an evidentiary hearing to determine if the title of vice president connoted control and decision-making authority or whether the employee was properly included in a stay bonus plan as a non-insider. 
In limited situations insiders have received retention bonuses since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act. Some courts have approved contracting with former officers and insiders as consultants in capacities where those officers are providing strategic leadership and related services in exchange for a fee – even over objections that such consulting arrangements effectively deliver an insider a retention bonus (see In re LG Philips Display USA, Inc, Case No 06-10245 (BLS), nt at 38 (Bankr D Del, Apr 13 2006) – the court suggested, without holding, that agreement to provide consulting services for fee is not akin to agreement to be employed and to be paid a retention bonus). 
Other courts have refused to upset pre-petition KERP planning where the bonuses are paid by a third party and where that third party is not seeking reimbursement from the estate. In In re Airway Indus Inc (354 BR 82 (Bankr WD Pa 2006)) the court approved retention bonuses for senior management that had been negotiated with the debtor’s senior secured creditor pre-petition as part of the terms of a sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. The court permitted the retention bonuses to be paid because the secured creditor and not the estate was the source of the payment, and importantly the bonuses were not added to the secured creditor’s claim, thereby depleting estate recoveries. 
Final Notes 
Section 503(c) of the Bankruptcy Code attempts to restrict severely transfers or obligations that have the effect of paying insiders merely to stay with distressed companies. It has largely succeeded in ending retention bonuses for insiders and other key employees. But the law has evolved sensibly in reaction to this prohibition. Retentive programs can be approved that benefit senior management. However, debtors must diligently ensure that such bonus programs are equitably structured to benefit non-management workers as well as officers and managers. Debtors must act to ensure that retentive incentive programs:

are cost-effective; 
derive from historical practice; 
are consistent with industry standards; and 
drive business performance or strategic success. 
Post-Bankruptcy Reform Act incentive and bonus programs for key employees must also be structured carefully and professionally so as not to deplete estate resources. Finally, debtors must be transparent regarding such programs with key stakeholders (eg, official and ad hoc committees, lenders, key executory contract counter parties) to build support and consensus for these plans.This chapter has been reprinted with the permission of The Americas Restructuring and Insolvency Guide 2008/2009.

Accounting for Incentive Units In an Limited Liability Corporation










Accounting
for Incentive Units in a Limited Liability Corporation

DRAFT
THIS DRAFT SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ACADEMIC, SCIENTIFIC,
LEGAL OR OTHER USES. THIS DRAFT CONSISTS OF UNVETTED, UNVERIFIED STATEMENTS
THAT COULD CHANGE AT ANY TIME.


Home page 
Issue 
When a company is incorporated as a Limited Liability Corporation
("LLC"), the company gives some employees incentive units which vest
when certain conditions are met (e.g. employment period exceeds three years).
The employee has the right to purchase these units which are voting equity units at a strike price
which is stated in advance.
This summary assumes that the
unit�s strike price is higher than the fair value at the time the unit is
vested.
Authoritative Literature 
After searching both
published and unpublished literature and inquiring with various technical
publications we found no technical literature that addresses incentive units in
LLCs or partnerships. Inquiry with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accounts showed that there is no authoritative literature in effect. 
Some accountants have treated such equity instrument in the same manner of stock
options, as mandated by APB 25 and FAS 123.
Financial Account Board�s
Financial Accounting Statement No. 123 ("FAS 123") Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation superceded APB Opinion No. 25 Account for Stock Issued to Employees. The main effect of FAS 123
over APB 25 is that under the preferred FAS 123, fair value is measured
by a stock-option value method and not by the "intrinsic value"
method prescribed in APB 25. 
According to FAS 123 it
"applies to all transactions in which an entity grants shares of its
common stock, stock options or other equity instruments to its employees,
except for equity instruments held by an employee stock ownership plan".
This application is in connection to "providing goods and services",
by either employees or suppliers (par. 6).
Stock Options and
Incentive Units
LLC�s incentive units appear
in substance to be similar to stock options. They have a pre-determined vesting
conditions and periods, pre-determined price and similar business reasons of
granting, i.e. compensating employees without cash outflow. Internal Revenue
Code ("IRC") section 424 governs the application of incentive stock
options. 
Some differences are present
however:

Deductibility
     of Stock Options by Employers

Incentive
stock options trigger ordinary income to the employer equal to the proceeds
received from the employees. These options are also not subject to ERISA but a
report of incentive stock options exercised is required as supplementary to the
W2 report to employees.
Incentive
units in an LLC are, under FAS 123 allocated over the vesting period as
compensation costs (or payment to service provider, if given to non-employees).

Who may be
     given incentive units? 

Incentive
stock options are options given to employees to purchase stock at favorable conditions,
with little risk of loosing if the stock underperforms when the option is
vested. They are granted only to employees who own less than 10% of the voting
power in the employer�s stock. 
Incentive
units, if viewed as stock options do not have such restrictions and can be
granted to non employees (e.g. suppliers); Incentive units granting disregards
the current ownership level of the recipient. 

Limitation
     on incentive units:

Incentive
stock options are limited in their vesting schedule for $100,000 per year for
tax purposes.
Incentive
units, treated like stock options do not carry such limitation.
Accounting Treatment of
Stock Options 
Both APB 25 and FAS 123 are
acceptable treatment, although FAS 123 is preferred. However, if APB 25 is
adopted, pro-forma income statement should be disclosed to the results under
the fair-value method prescribed in FAS 123 (par. 45).
Under APB 25, companies
recognize compensation expense stemming from employee stock option based on the
difference between the strike price (typically lower, and the fair value of the
stock on day of grant. That difference in the proceeds from employee�s stock
option is attributed to compensation and is recognized as compensation expense
under APB 25. For example, on January 1, 2001 an employee is granted a strike
price of $10. The employee exercises their strike price on January 1, 2001. The
employee stock option vests on December 31, 2003. On December 31, 2002 the
stock�s value is $17 on the open market. On December 31, 2003 the company grants
the employee the stock � which is now vested and recognizes compensation
expense of $7 per share.
Under FAS 123, the excess of
the projected estimated fair value (par. 9) of the stock option upon vesting
over the strike price is allocated over the service period (par. 30). The
service period starts at the date of exercise and ends at the date of vesting.
The projected price of non public companies may result in a minimum value for
the stock option because market price volatility is unknown. For example, an
employee exercises a stock option on January 1, 2001 at a strike price of $10
per share and the stock option vests in three years, on December 31, 2003. On
January 1, 2001 the stock option fair value, using a projection model, is
estimated to be $19 per share. The company will recognize a $3 ($9 / 3 years =
$3) per year of compensation expense. On December 31, 2002 the employee�s
option is vested and the company grants the employee a stock.
While the employee�s option
is not vested the company also reclassifies the unissued stock as restricted.
Generally, the projected fair price (in the example above, $19) is the value
upon restriction.
Some Employee Stock Option
Plans (ESOP) does not qualify as stock options that trigger compensation
expense recognition. Generally, when employees can purchase the stock at a
small discount (de-minimus), and when substantially all full time
employees qualify, the excess of the fair value of the stock over the strike
price is not compensation expense to the company.
Other issues
Repurchase agreement
A mandatory repurchase agreement does not change the
accounting treatment of stock-options (par. 219).
Dividends
Generally, additional compensation for dividends on unvested
stock options, or stock options that allow the employee to keep such dividends
is charged as compensation expense in the period of payment.
Tax Effects
Generally, prepaid
compensation expenses are not tax deductible. The time value of the
compensation, which is "built in" the projected estimated value upon
the option�s vesting is also not tax deductible. Therefore, a temporary
difference (resulting in a deferred tax asset) is accounted for based on the
accumulated applicable compensation costs and reduced by a valuation allowance
(par. 227). 
Once vested and granted, the
actual compensation cost in excess of the accumulated compensation cost that
was used for the deferred tax asset should be recognized as additional paid in
capital and not as deferred tax asset (par. 228). However, if the actual
compensation cost is below the compensation cost that was used for the deferred
tax asset, the write off should first be taken from additional paid in capital
that is attributed to any prior excess, and then as an expense on the income
statement. (par. 229).
Summary
Incentive units are more
similar in substance to stock options than to incentive stock options. Although
no direct authoritative literature exist to mandate the accounting treatment of
an LLC�s incentive units
FAS 123 require the fair
value method to be applied to the stock options upon exercising them by the
employee or service provider. The excess of the projected fair value of the
option over the strike price should be allocated over the vesting period. When
the stock vests, the difference between the accumulated allocation and the
actual fair value of the option is charged to APIC.
If the vesting and
excersising occurs simulataniously, the charge is to the period of exercised
and the difference if to APIC for excess or as a loss to the income statement.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation

What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.

Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
