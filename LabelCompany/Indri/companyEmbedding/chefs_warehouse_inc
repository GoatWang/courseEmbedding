Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Would you like more ideas on how to lay out your kitchen design?
Browsing photos and filling out your idea file is a great way to start the design process. You may also want to talk to a member of our design studio about storage solutions, whether you have space for a feature such as an island or pantry cabinet, and how to incorporate decorative accessories such as crown molding and furniture feet. Call our design studio at 888-350-1242 or send us a little information to start your free design.
In any kitchen remodel, cabinets set the tone (and represent a large share of the budget). Before you buy, try out free samples in your home, where you can examine quality at your leisure and appearance in natural light. We will also send a style catalog - more than 60 color pages of kitchen design ideas, cabinet details and information you need before you buy. Choose your cabinet samples from traditional, contemporary or transitional styles, in maple, cherry, oak or birch stained hardwood, or beautiful decorator pain finishes. We build kitchens to order, selling semi-custom cabinets direct from our factory to provide the quality you deserve at prices you can afford.

Meet our talented designers
A great kitchen begins with a great plan. At CliqStudios.com, a designer will work with you - on your schedule - to plan your dream kitchen. It won't be based on some basic "one-size-fits-all" format. It won't be based on any pre-cut, pre-built cabinets. It will be a plan for your kitchen that you and a professional kitchen designer develop together. The only limitations are your imagination, your space and your budget.
Contact a Designer







Getting started is as easy as 1-2-3.
Now is the time to make your dream kitchen a reality.  You've thought about it a lot. You know what absolutely must be changed. You know what you'd love to have. But you don't know what to do next.  No problem. All it takes is a phone call. 888-350-1242


 
Measure Your Space
Take a few quick measurements and snap a photo; it's true that a picture is worth a thousand words.  Then send that all to us.



 
Design Your Kitchen
One of our professional designers will work with you individually – at your convenience – to design your dream kitchen.




 
Approve & Finish
You'll receive a design packet with floor plans, 3D color renderings and more… all without cost or obligation.
