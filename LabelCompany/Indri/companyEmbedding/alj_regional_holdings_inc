Jess Ravich said, "We
        continue to focus on growing revenue and earnings
        consistently over time, and the second quarter results show
        our commitment to this objective"
      

Anna Van Buren stated,
        "Faneuil's strong second quarter performance was
        highlighted by four contract renewals in transportation,
        utilities and healthcare, with the addition of a major new
        contract awarded by the Transportation Corridor Agencies in
        southern California.  The TCA award was especially
        significant, as it marks the expansion of Faneuil's
        electronic tolling operations to the West Coast."
      

        "We experienced significant increases in revenue in the
        second quarter primarily due to increases from our national
        home builders," said Steve
        Chesin, CEO of Carpets.  "Our costs have
        remained higher to deliver the additional revenue. 
        However, we believe the cost cutting measures we are
        implementing currently will take effect over the next two
        quarters."
      

Marc Reisch, Executive
        Chairman of Phoenix Color, stated, "The increase in second
        quarter revenue for Phoenix Color was primarily
        attributable to the Color Optics packaging business that
        was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Packaging
        generated positive EBITDA in the second quarter versus a
        modest loss in the first quarter, and we anticipate
        improved packaging performance in the second half of 2017
        due to expected cost synergies.  Consolidated Phoenix
        EBITDA was flat as increased revenue from certain major
        customers was offset by lower revenue in the second quarter
        from the education book market.  We believe this
        reduction is due primarily to the timing of production of
        work which has shifted to the second half in 2017 versus
        being done in the first half of 2016."
      

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


        In this release, we present certain adjusted financial
        measures that are not calculated according to generally
        accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). These
        non-GAAP financial measures are designed to complement the
        GAAP financial information presented in this release
        because management believes they present information
        regarding ALJ that is useful to investors. The non-GAAP
        financial measures presented should not be considered in
        isolation from, or as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP
        financial measure.
      

        We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest
        income and expense, income taxes, non-cash stock based
        compensation, depreciation and amortization. We present
        adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by
        analysts, investors and other interested parties in the
        evaluation of our company.  Adjusted EBITDA measures
        are not calculated in the same manner by all companies and,
        accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure for
        comparison.  A reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA
        to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP
        measure, can be obtained by subtracting depreciation and
        amortization, non-cash stock based compensation,
        restructuring expenses and non-recurring fees associated
        with ALJ's uplisting to the NASDAQ from ALJ adjusted
        EBITDA.  A reconciliation of Faneuil's, Carpets' and
        Phoenix's adjusted EBITDA
        to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP
        measure, can be obtained by subtracting depreciation and
        amortization and non-cash stock based compensation from
        consolidated operating income.  Following is a
        reconciliation of consolidated operating income to
        consolidated adjusted EBITDA (in millions):
