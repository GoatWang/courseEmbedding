1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

How Nplate® Works: Video Transcript
Indication
Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.
Not all patients will respond to Nplate®. Individual patient results may vary.
Hello! This video is designed to help you understand:

How platelets are naturally made in the body.
How immune thrombocytopenia (or ITP) causes low platelet counts.
How Nplate® works to help increase the number of platelets in adults with chronic ITP.
Nplate® Important Safety Information.

At any given time, trillions of blood cells are circulating in your body.
There are different types of cells in your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
ITP is a condition that specifically affects your platelets. Let's take a look inside the body to learn more about platelets.
Platelets are small cells that are needed to help your blood form clots.
They are made by special cells in your bones, in the spongy core called bone marrow. Platelets are normally destroyed after 9 or 10 days and replaced with new platelets.
A protein called thrombopoietin, or TPO, controls how many platelets are made.
In the bone marrow, TPO attaches to the cells that make platelets. This triggers the cells to make platelets and release them into the blood. If the level of TPO in the blood is low, fewer platelets are made. If the level of TPO in the blood is high, more platelets are made.
Normally when there are adequate or high numbers of platelets in circulation, TPO levels are low. However, when platelet levels drop, TPO levels increase to help make more platelets.
Now let's discuss what happens to platelets in adults with chronic ITP.
In adults with chronic ITP, platelets are destroyed by antibodies.
In ITP, antibodies cause the destruction of TPO, the protein needed for platelet production. Since TPO naturally binds to platelets, it is destroyed along with the platelets.
Because TPO levels are low, there is not a strong enough signal for normal platelet production, and therefore, not enough platelets are being produced.
This means ITP involves both increased platelet destruction and lower-than-expected platelet production, which results in low platelet counts.
People with ITP who have lower-than-normal platelet counts have a condition called thrombocytopenia, which can cause bleeding, bruising, and other symptoms.
Now that we've discussed how platelets are formed, and what happens in adults with chronic ITP, let's discuss how Nplate® works to help increase platelet counts in adults with chronic ITP.
Nplate® is a type of medicine called a platelet booster.
Like TPO, Nplate® attaches to special cells in the bone marrow, triggering platelet production.
Nplate® increases platelet production at a rate that outpaces platelet destruction, which helps increase platelet counts in adults with chronic ITP.
It's important to know that not all patients will respond to Nplate®, and individual patient results may vary.
It's important to understand that Nplate® does not bring platelet counts to normal levels, but it can help raise them to a level high enough to help reduce symptoms of ITP.

Important Safety Information
                What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?
            
Nplate® can cause serious side effects:


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
                    Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
                
Higher risk for blood clots:

You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.


Loss of response:
                    If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
                

Blood test monitoring:
                    Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
                


What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?

Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
The most common side effects of Nplate®are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch
, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

How Nplate® works
Platelets are made by cells in the bone marrow. A protein in your body called thrombopoietin (TPO) tells these cells to produce platelets. Nplate® works like TPO, helping bone marrow cells to produce more platelets, which may help reduce the risk of bleeding.1,3

Nplate® works with the body to make more platelets




The body needs a protein called thrombopoietin (TPO) to help cells in the bone marrow to make more platelets. Adult patients with ITP have less TPO than they need.4-7





Nplate® works like the body’s own TPO, helping bone marrow cells to make more platelets.1,8





With Nplate®, cells in the bone marrow make more platelets that may help stay ahead of the platelet destruction.1

Some treatments for chronic ITP work on the immune system to decrease platelet destruction.9,10
Nplate® works with the cells in the bone marrow to make more platelets by helping increase platelet production, which can help increase the number of healthy platelets in your body. Nplate® does this by imitating TPO, the protein that helps cells in the bone marrow to make more platelets.1

Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.


Please see Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for more information about Nplate® on Nplate.com.



Indication
Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.

Starting Nplate®
How should I take Nplate®?1

Before you receive Nplate® you should first talk with your healthcare provider and understand the benefits and risks of Nplate®.
Nplate® is given as a subcutaneous (SC) injection under the skin one time each week. You may not give Nplate® injections to yourself.
Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Tell your healthcare provider about any bruising or bleeding that occurs while you are receiving Nplate®.
If you miss a scheduled dose of Nplate®, call your healthcare provider to arrange for your next dose as soon as possible.






Getting to your right dose1

The initial recommended dose for Nplate® is based on your actual body weight.
Your doctor will adjust your weekly dose until you reach a platelet count range that reduces the risk of bleeding.
Don't get discouraged if you don’t reach your treatment goal right away. It takes some patients several weeks and may require dose adjustments* until a stable platelet count is reached.
Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Work with your doctor and stay with your treatment plan.

*In clinical trials, the average number of dose changes until patients reached a platelet count high enough to reduce the risk for bleeding was 3. Not all patients were able to reach a platelet count above 50,000 per microliter.1,2

Checking your platelet count regularly1

If you stop taking Nplate®, blood tests are needed for at least 2 weeks after. This is to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Tell your healthcare provider about any bruising or bleeding that occurs while you are receiving Nplate®.
If you miss a scheduled dose of Nplate, call your healthcare provider to arrange for your next dose as soon as possible.

Applicants' Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (“THG”), formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Start Printed Page 20666Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the outstanding ordinary shares.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios (“Substitutions”):

The following 13 Global Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Insights Portfolio.
8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (“BlackRock”) or Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.[2] 

15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Start Printed Page 20669Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). Pre-Substitution Notices sent to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17 Start Printed Page 20670Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from the Commission.
3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 7 Start Printed Page 20671above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

     The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

each Fund will have a specified
minimum number of Municipal
Securities holdings and will be subject
to percentage limitations on a Fund’s
total assets invested in Municipal
Securities of individual issuers, states
and sectors, as described above.
The proposed rule change is designed
to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect investors and the
public interest in that the Exchange will
obtain a representation from the issuer
of the Shares that the NAV per Share
will be calculated daily and that the
NAV and the Disclosed Portfolio will be
made available to all market
participants at the same time. In
addition, a large amount of information
is publicly available regarding each
Fund and the Shares, thereby promoting
market transparency. Quotation and last
sale information for the Shares and
ETFs will be available via the CTA highspeed line, and from the national
securities exchange on which they are
listed. Prior to the commencement of
trading, the Exchange will inform its
Equity Trading Permit Holders in an
Information Bulletin of the special
characteristics and risks associated with
trading the Shares. Trading in Shares of
the Funds will be halted if the circuit
breaker parameters in NYSE Arca
Equities Rule 7.12 have been reached or
because of market conditions or for
reasons that, in the view of the
Exchange, make trading in the Shares
inadvisable. Trading in the Shares will
be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule
8.600(d)(2)(D), which sets forth
circumstances under which Shares of
the Funds may be halted. In addition, as
noted above, investors will have ready
access to information regarding the
Funds’ holdings, the IOPV, the
Disclosed Portfolio, and quotation and
last sale information for the Shares.
The proposed rule change is designed
to perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest in that
it will facilitate the listing and trading
of additional types of actively-managed
exchange-traded products that
principally hold municipal bonds and
that will enhance competition among
market participants, to the benefit of
investors and the marketplace. As noted
above, the Exchange has in place
surveillance procedures relating to
trading in the Shares and may obtain
information via ISG from other
exchanges that are members of ISG or
with which the Exchange has entered
into a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement. In addition, as noted
above, investors will have ready access
to information regarding each Fund’s
holdings, IOPV, Disclosed Portfolio, and

quotation and last sale information for
the Shares.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that
the proposed rule change will impose
any burden on competition that is not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purpose of the Act. The Exchange
notes that the proposed rule change will
facilitate the listing and trading of
additional types of actively-managed
exchange-traded products that
principally hold municipal bonds and
that will enhance competition among
market participants, to the benefit of
investors and the marketplace.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Comments on the
Proposed Rule Change Received From
Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited
or received with respect to the proposed
rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for
Commission Action
Within 45 days of the date of
publication of this notice in the Federal
Register or within such longer period
up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may
designate if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which
the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) By order approve or disapprove
the proposed rule change, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine
whether the proposed rule change
should be disapproved.

Applicants’ Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance
company engaged in the business of
writing individual and group annuity
contracts and life insurance policies.
Commonwealth was originally
organized under the laws of Delaware in
July 1974 and was subsequently redomiciled in the state of Massachusetts
effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005,
Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity
Company) was an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of The Hanover
Insurance Group (‘‘THG’’), formerly
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On
that date, THG completed the closing of
the sale of Commonwealth to The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (‘‘Goldman
Sachs’’). Effective September 1, 2006,
Commonwealth changed its name from
Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

20666

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

Annuity Company to Commonwealth
Annuity and Life Insurance Company.
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs
completed the transfer of the common
stock of Commonwealth to Global
Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
Global Atlantic Financial Group
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014,
Forethought Services LLC acquired
ownership of 79% of the shares of
Commonwealth. Forethought Services
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Forethought Financial Group, Inc.,
which in turn is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin)
Company. As of December 31, 2015,
Goldman Sachs owns a total of
approximately 22% of the outstanding
shares of Global Atlantic; and other
investors, none of whom own more than
9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the
outstanding ordinary shares.

3. Each of the Separate Accounts
meets the definition of ‘‘separate
account,’’ as defined in Section 2(a)(37)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 0–1(e)
thereunder. The Separate Accounts are
registered with the Commission under
the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts.
The assets of the Separate Accounts
support the Contracts and interests in
the Separate Accounts offered through
such Contracts. Commonwealth is the
legal owner of the assets in the Separate
Accounts. The Separate Accounts are
segmented into subaccounts, and each
subaccount invests in an underlying
registered open-end management
investment company or a series thereof.
A subaccount of one or more of the
Separate Accounts corresponds to each
of the Existing Portfolios. The business
and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as
unit investment trusts, are conducted by
Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.

4. The Contracts are each registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the ‘‘1933 Act’’), on Form N–
4 or Form N–6, as applicable. Each of
the Contracts has particular fees,
charges, and investment options, as
described in the Contracts’ respective
registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or
group deferred variable annuity
contracts or variable life insurance
policies. As set forth in the prospectuses
for the Contracts, Commonwealth
reserves the right to substitute shares of
another registered investment company
for the shares of any registered
investment company already purchased
or to be purchased in the future by the
Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth
below, to substitute shares of the
Replacement Portfolios for shares of the
Existing Portfolios (‘‘Substitutions’’):

December 31, 2015, GSAM, including
its investment advisory affiliates, had
assets under supervision of
approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM’s

Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the
Replacement Portfolios have investment
objectives, principal investment
strategies, and principle risks, as
described in their prospectuses, that are
substantially similar to, the
corresponding Existing Portfolios to
make those Replacement Portfolios
appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing
Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio,
including investment objectives,
principal investment strategies,
principal risks, and comparative
performance history, can be found in
the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting
the Replacement Portfolios,
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund
lineups while reducing costs and
maintaining a high-quality menu of
investment options that would offer a
similar diversity of investment options
after the proposed Substitutions as is
currently available under the Contracts.
Contract owners with Contract value
allocated to the subaccounts of the
Existing Portfolios will have lower or
equal net annual operating expenses
immediately after the proposed
Substitutions as before the proposed
Substitutions. With respect to all of the
proposed Substitutions, the combined
management fee and Rule 12b–1 fees
paid by the Replacement Portfolio are
the same or lower than those of the
corresponding Existing Portfolio. The
application sets forth the fees and
expenses of each Existing Portfolio and
its corresponding Replacement Portfolio
in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the
Substitution Date (defined below), the
Separate Accounts will redeem shares of
the Existing Portfolios for cash or inkind. Redemption requests and
purchase orders will be placed
simultaneously so that Contract values
will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected
at the relative net asset values of the
respective shares of the Replacement
Portfolios in conformity with Section
22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the
Section 26 Applicants. The

PO 00000

Frm 00110

Fmt 4703

Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contracts held by affected Contract
owners.2
15. Contract owners will not incur
any fees or charges as a result of the
proposed Substitutions. The obligations
of the Section 26 Applicants, and the
rights of the affected Contract owners,
under the Contracts of affected Contract
owners will not be altered in any way.
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will
pay all expenses and transaction costs of
the Substitutions, including legal and
accounting expenses, any applicable
brokerage expenses and other fees and
expenses. No fees or charges will be
assessed to the affected Contract owners
to effect the Substitutions. The proposed
Substitutions will not cause the
Contract fees and charges currently
being paid by Contract owners to be
greater after the proposed Substitution
than before the proposed Substitution.
In addition, the Substitutions will in no
way alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree
that, for a period of two years following
the implementation of the proposed
Substitution (the ‘‘Substitution Date’’),
and for those Contracts with assets
allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the
Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust)
will reimburse, on the last business day
of each fiscal quarter, the Contract
owners whose subaccounts invest in the
applicable Replacement Portfolio to the
extent that the Replacement Portfolio’s
net annual operating expenses (taking
into account fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) for such period
exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net
annual operating expenses of the
2 The Section 26 Applicants state that, because
the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset
value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts
will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the
benefits offered by the guarantees under the
Contracts will be the same immediately before and
after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants
also state that what effect the Substitutions may
have on the value of the benefits offered by the
Contract guarantees would depend, among other
things, on the relative future performance of the
Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios,
which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict.
Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at
the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will
offer a comparable variety of investment options
with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

subaccount investing in an Existing
Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the
Replacement Portfolio (after the
Substitution) to any other available
subaccount under the Contract without
charge and without imposing any
transfer limitations. Further, on the
Substitution Date, Contract values
attributable to investments in each
Existing Portfolio will be transferred to
the corresponding Replacement
Portfolio without charge and without
being subject to any transfer limitations.
Moreover, Commonwealth will not
exercise any rights reserved under the
Contracts to impose restrictions on
transfers between the subaccounts
under the Contracts, including
limitations on the future number of
transfers, for a period beginning at least
30 days before the Substitution Date
through at least 30 days following the
Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the
Substitution Date, Contract owners will
be notified via prospectus supplements
that the Section 26 Applicants received
or expect to receive Commission
approval of the applicable proposed
Substitutions and of the anticipated
Substitution Date (the ‘‘Pre-Substitution
Notice’’). Pre-Substitution Notices sent
to Contract owners will be filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under
the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution
Notice will advise Contract owners that
from the date of the Pre-Substitution
Notice through the date 30 days after the
Substitutions, Contract owners may
make at least one transfer of Contract
value from the subaccounts investing in
the Existing Portfolios (before the
Substitutions) or the Replacement
Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any
other available subaccount without
charge and without imposing any
transfer limitations. Among other
information, the notice will inform
affected Contract owners that that,
except as described in the disruptive
transfers or market timing provisions of
the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth
will not exercise any rights reserved
under the Contracts to impose
restrictions on transfers among the

VerDate Sep<11>2014

Jkt 241001

subaccounts under the Contracts,
including limitations on the future
number of transfers, through at least 30
days after the Substitution Date.
Additionally, all affected Contract
owners will be sent prospectuses of the
applicable Replacement Portfolios at
least 30 days before the Substitution
Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements
distributed to the Contract owners,
within five business days after the
Substitution Date, Contract owners
whose assets are allocated to a
Replacement Portfolio as part of the
proposed Substitutions will be sent a
written notice (each, a ‘‘Confirmation’’)
informing them that the Substitutions
were carried out as previously notified.
The Confirmation also will restate the
information set forth in the PreSubstitution Notice. The Confirmation
will also reflect the values of the
Contract owner’s positions in the
Existing Portfolio before the
Substitution and the Replacement
Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request
that the Commission issue an order
pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940
Act approving the proposed
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940
Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of
a unit investment trust that invests
exclusively in the securities of a single
issuer from substituting the securities of
another issuer without the approval of
the Commission. Section 26(c) provides
that such approval shall be granted by
order from the Commission if the
evidence establishes that the
substitution is consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit
that the Substitutions meet the
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and
that, if implemented, the Substitutions
would not raise any of the concerns that
Congress intended to address when the
1940 Act was amended to include this
provision. Applicants state that each
Substitution protects the Contract
owners who have Contract value
allocated to an Existing Portfolio by
providing Replacement Portfolios with
substantially similar investment
objectives, strategies, and risks, and
providing Contract owners with
investment options that would have
total and net annual operating expense
ratios that are lower than, or equal to,
their corresponding investment options
before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the
right under the Contracts to substitute
shares of another underlying fund for

PO 00000

Frm 00111

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

20669

one of the current funds offered as an
investment option under the Contracts.
The Contracts and the Contracts’
prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit
that the ultimate effect of the proposed
Substitutions will be to streamline and
simplify the investment line-ups that
are available to Contract owners while
reducing expenses and continuing to
provide Contract owners with a wide
array of investment options. The Section
26 Applicants state that the proposed
Substitutions will not reduce in any
manner the nature or quality of the
available investment options and the
proposed Substitutions also will permit
Commonwealth to present information
to its Contract owners in a simpler and
more concise manner. The Section 26
Applicants also state it is anticipated
that after the proposed Substitutions,
Contract owners will be provided with
disclosure documents that contain a
simpler presentation of the available
investment options under the Contracts.
The Section 26 Applicants also assert
that the proposed Substitutions are not
of the type that Section 26 was designed
to prevent because they will not result
in costly forced redemption, nor will
they affect other aspects of the
Contracts. In addition, the proposed
Substitutions will not adversely affect
any features or riders under the
Contracts because none of the features
or riders have any investment
restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract
owner will involuntarily lose his or her
features or riders as a result of any
proposed Substitution. Moreover, the
Section 26 Applicants will offer
Contract owners the opportunity to
transfer amounts out of the affected
subaccounts without any cost or other
penalty (other than those necessary to
implement policies and procedures
designed to detect and deter disruptive
transfer and other ‘‘market timing’’
activity) that may otherwise have been
imposed for a period beginning on the
date of the Pre-Substitution Notice
(which supplement will be delivered to
the Contract owners at least thirty (30)
days before the Substitution Date) and
ending no earlier than thirty (30) days
after the Substitution Date. The
proposed Substitutions are also unlike
the type of substitution that Section
26(c) was designed to prevent in that the
Substitutions have no impact on other
aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request
an order under Section 17(b) exempting
them from the provisions of Section
17(a) to the extent necessary to permit
the Section 17 Applicants to carry out
some or all of the proposed
Substitutions. The Section 17

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

nlaroche on DSK30NT082PROD with NOTICES

20670

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

Applicants state that because the
proposed Substitutions may be effected,
in whole or in part, by means of in-kind
redemptions and purchases, the
proposed Substitutions may be deemed
to involve one or more purchases or
sales of securities or property between
affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in
relevant part, prohibits any affiliated
person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of
such person, acting as principal, from
knowingly selling any security or other
property to that company. Section
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally
prohibits the persons described above,
acting as principals, from knowingly
purchasing any security or other
property from the registered investment
company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state
that the proposed transactions may
involve a transfer of portfolio securities
by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate
Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the
Separate Accounts would purchase
shares of the Replacement Portfolios
with the portfolio securities received
from the Existing Portfolios.
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants
provide that to the extent
Commonwealth and the Existing
Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to
be affiliated persons of one another
under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9)
of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that
this aspect of the proposed
Substitutions could be viewed as being
prohibited by Section 17(a).
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants
have determined to seek relief from
Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit
that the terms of the proposed in-kind
purchases of shares of the Replacement
Portfolios by the Separate Accounts,
including the consideration to be paid
and received, as described in the
application, are reasonable and fair and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned. The Section
17 Applicants submit that the terms of
the proposed in-kind transactions,
including the considered to be paid to
each Existing Portfolio and received by
each Replacement Portfolio involved,
are reasonable, fair and do not involve
overreaching principally because the
transactions will conform with all but
one of the conditions enumerated in
Rule 17a–7 under the 1940 Act. The
proposed transactions will take place at
relative net asset value in conformity
with the requirements of Section 22(c)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the

VerDate Sep<11>2014

14:29 May 02, 2017

Jkt 241001

Section 26 Applicants. The
Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contract held by the affected Contract
owners. The Substitutions will in no
way alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions. The fees and charges
under the Contracts will not increase
because of the Substitutions. Even
though the Separate Accounts,
Commonwealth and the Trust may not
rely on Rule 17a–7, the Section 17
Applicants believe that the rule’s
conditions outline the type of
safeguards that result in transactions
that are fair and reasonable to registered
investment company participants and
preclude overreaching in connection
with an investment company by its
affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also
submit that the proposed in-kind
purchases by the Separate Accounts are
consistent with the policies of the Trust
and the Replacement Portfolios, as
provided in the Trust’s registration
statement and reports filed under the
1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17
Applicants submit that the proposed
Substitutions are consistent with the
general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants’ Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and
Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that
any order granting the requested relief
will be subject to the following
conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be
effected unless Commonwealth
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow
the substitution of shares of registered
open-end investment companies in the
manner contemplated by the
application; (ii) the Substitutions can be
consummated as described in the
application under applicable insurance
laws; and (iii) any regulatory
requirements in each jurisdiction where
the Contracts are qualified for sale have
been complied with to the extent
necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global
Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser,
add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely
on the Manager of Managers Order (as
defined in the application), or any
replacement order from the
Commission, with respect to any
Replacement Portfolio without first
obtaining shareholder approval of the
change in sub-adviser, the new subadviser, or the Replacement Portfolio’s
ability to rely on the Manager of
Managers Order, or any replacement
order from the Commission.

3. Commonwealth or an affiliate
thereof (other than the Trust) will pay
all expenses and transaction costs of the
Substitutions, including legal and
accounting expenses, any applicable
brokerage expenses and other fees and
expenses. No fees or charges will be
assessed to the affected Contract owners
to effect the Substitutions. The proposed
Substitutions will not cause the
Contract fees and charges currently
being paid by Contract owners to be
greater after the proposed Substitution
than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected
at the relative net asset values of the
respective shares of the Replacement
Portfolios in conformity with Section
22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the
Section 26 Applicants. The
Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contracts held by affected Contract
owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way
alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26
Applicants, and the rights of the
affected Contract owners, under the
Contracts of affected Contract owners
will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be
permitted to make at least one transfer
of Contract value from the subaccount
investing in the Existing Portfolio
(before the Substitution Date) or the
Replacement Portfolio (after the
Substitution Date) to any other available
investment option under the Contract
without charge for a period beginning at
least 30 days before the Substitution
Date through at least 30 days following
the Substitution Date. Except as
described in any market timing/shortterm trading provisions of the relevant
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants
will not exercise any rights reserved
under the Contracts to impose
restrictions on transfers between the
subaccounts under the Contracts,
including limitations on the future
number of transfers, for a period
beginning at least 30 days before the
Substitution Date through at least 30
days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be
notified, at least 30 days before the
Substitution Date about: (i) The
intended Substitution of Existing
Portfolios with the Replacement
Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution
Date; and (iii) information with respect
to transfers as set forth in Condition 7

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices
above. In addition, the Section 26
Applicants will also deliver to affected
Contract owners, at least thirty days
before the Substitution Date, a
prospectus for each applicable
Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will
deliver to each affected Contract owner
within five business days of the
Substitution Date a written confirmation
which will include: (i) A confirmation
that the Substitutions were carried out
as previously notified; (ii) a restatement
of the information set forth in the PreSubstitution Notice; and (iii) values of
the Contract owner’s positions in the
Existing Portfolio before the
Substitution and the Replacement
Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years
following the Substitution Date, for
Contract owners who were Contract
owners as of the Substitution Date,
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof
(other than the Trust) will reimburse, on
the last business day of each fiscal
quarter, the Contract owners whose
subaccounts invest in the applicable
Replacement Portfolio to the extent that
the Replacement Portfolio’s net annual
operating expenses (taking into account
fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) for such period
exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net
annual operating expenses of the
Existing Portfolio for the most recent
fiscal year preceding the date of the
application. In addition, the Section 26
Applicants will not increase the
Contract fees and charges that would
otherwise be assessed under the terms
of the Contracts for a period of at least
two years following the Substitution
Date.
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

Assistant Secretary.

(‘‘Exchange Act’’),2 that the Securities
and Exchange Commission
(‘‘Commission’’) grant an exemption

statements for the latest fiscal year of
the exchange.7
The Instructions to Form 1 define an
‘‘affiliate’’ as ‘‘[a]ny person that, directly
or indirectly, controls, is under common
control with, or is controlled by, the
national securities exchange . . .,
including any employees.’’ 8 The
Instructions to Form 1 define ‘‘control’’
as
The power, directly or indirectly, to direct
the management or policies of a company,
whether through ownership of securities, by
contract or otherwise. Any person that . . .
directly or indirectly has the right to vote
25% or more of a class of voting securities
or has the power to sell or direct the sale of
25% or more of a class of voting securities
. . . is presumed to control that entity.9

Each Exchange has requested that the
Commission grant it an exemption
pursuant to Section 36(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act, subject to the conditions
set forth below, with respect to its
‘‘Foreign Indirect Affiliates,’’ as defined
below, from the requirement under Rule
6a–2(b)(1) under the Exchange Act to
file the financial information required
by Exhibit D.
Each Exemption Request states that
the respective Exchange is a whollyowned subsidiary of NYSE Group, Inc.
(‘‘NYSE Group’’), a Delaware
corporation. Each Exemption Request
further states that NYSE Group is
wholly owned by NYSE Holdings LLC
(‘‘NYSE Holdings’’), a Delaware limited
liability company, which is wholly
owned by Intercontinental Exchange
Holdings, Inc. (‘‘ICE Holdings’’), a
Delaware corporation. In turn, ICE
Holdings is wholly owned by
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Parent
Company’’), a Delaware corporation.
The Parent Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns a
large number of foreign entities, some of
which also own interests in other
foreign entities in excess of 25%.10 The
foreign entity affiliates and subsidiaries
of the Parent Company are referred to,
collectively, as the ‘‘Foreign Indirect
Affiliates.’’
Each Exchange states that, because of
the limited and indirect nature of its
7 Exhibit D to Form 1 requires that such financial
statements consist, at a minimum, of a balance
sheet and an income statement with such footnotes
and other disclosures necessary to avoid rendering
the financial statements misleading. Exhibit D
further provides that, if any affiliate or subsidiary
is required by another Commission rule to submit
annual financial statements, the exchange may
provide a statement to that effect, with a citation to
the other Commission rule, in lieu of the financial
statements required by Exhibit D.

Applicants' Representations

    1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business 
of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance 
policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of 
Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of 
Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
    2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica 
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (``THG''), formerly 
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the 
closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
(``Goldman Sachs''). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed 
its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

[[Page 20666]]

Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. 
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the 
common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is 
a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group 
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired 
ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services 
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., 
which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) 
Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of 
approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and 
other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% 
of the outstanding ordinary shares.
    3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of ``separate 
account,'' as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-
1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the 
Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of 
the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the 
Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the 
legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate 
Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in 
an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a 
series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts 
corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and 
affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are 
conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
    4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as 
applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and 
investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective 
registration statements.
    5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity 
contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the 
prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to 
substitute shares of another registered investment company for the 
shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be 
purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
    6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of 
the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios 
(``Substitutions''):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The 
Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was 
organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission 
as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File 
No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File 
No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently 
has 30 separate portfolios (each, a ``Global Atlantic Fund,'' and 
collectively, the ``Global Atlantic Funds''). The following 13 Global 
Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined 
Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core 
Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman 
Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global 
Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap 
Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap 
Value Insights Portfolio.
    8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a 
registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of 
the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement 
between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global 
Atlantic.
    9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock 
Investment Management, LLC (``BlackRock'') or Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management, L.P. (``GSAM''). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a 
commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, 
Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets 
under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 
University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman 
Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory 
affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 
trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New 
York, NY 20182.
    10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have 
investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle 
risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially 
similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those 
Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
    11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement 
Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment 
strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can 
be found in the application.
    12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, 
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and 
maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer 
a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed 
Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract 
owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing 
Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses 
immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed 
Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the 
combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement 
Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding 
Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of 
each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in 
greater detail.
    13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined 
below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing 
Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders 
will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully 
invested at all times.
    14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the 
Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees 
and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the 
Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the 
Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the 
Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect 
the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by 
the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the 
relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and 
Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot 
predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the 
time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable 
variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return 
characteristics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result 
of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 
Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the 
Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. 
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and 
transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting 
expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and 
expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract 
owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not 
cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract 
owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the 
proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way 
alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with 
their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as 
a result of the Substitutions.
    16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years 
following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the 
``Substitution Date''), and for those Contracts with assets allocated 
to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an 
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last 
business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose 
subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the 
extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses 
(taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such 
period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating 
expenses of the

[[Page 20669]]

Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date 
of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase 
the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under 
the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following 
the Substitution Date.
    17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) 
through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount 
investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the 
Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available 
subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any 
transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract 
values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be 
transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge 
and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for 
a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date 
through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
    18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 
Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the 
applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution 
Date (the ``Pre-Substitution Notice''). Pre-Substitution Notices sent 
to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise 
Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice 
through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts 
investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the 
Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available 
subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer 
limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected 
Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive 
transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, 
through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all 
affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable 
Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
    19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract 
owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of 
the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a 
``Confirmation'') informing them that the Substitutions were carried 
out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the 
information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation 
will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.

Legal Analysis

    1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an 
order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed 
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or 
trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the 
securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of 
another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) 
provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the 
Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 
1940 Act.
    2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the 
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the 
Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress 
intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this 
provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the 
Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing 
Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially 
similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing 
Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net 
annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their 
corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
    3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to 
substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current 
funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The 
Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
    4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the 
proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the 
investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while 
reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide 
array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the 
proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or 
quality of the available investment options and the proposed 
Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to 
its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 
26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed 
Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure 
documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available 
investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also 
assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 
26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly 
forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. 
In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any 
features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or 
riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner 
will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of 
any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will 
offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the 
affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than 
those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect 
and deter disruptive transfer and other ``market timing'' activity) 
that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date 
of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to 
the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution 
Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the 
Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type 
of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the 
Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
    5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) 
exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent 
necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all 
of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17

[[Page 20670]]

Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be 
effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and 
purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or 
more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated 
persons.
    6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits 
any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly 
selling any security or other property to that company. Section 
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described 
above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or 
other property from the registered investment company.
    7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions 
may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing 
Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the 
Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios 
with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. 
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent 
Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the 
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one 
another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is 
conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be 
viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 
17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
    8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed 
in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the 
Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, 
as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not 
involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 
17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind 
transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing 
Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are 
reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because 
the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions 
enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions 
will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the 
requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected 
Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax 
treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their 
Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a 
result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts 
will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the 
Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-
7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline 
the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and 
reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude 
overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated 
persons.
    9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind 
purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of 
the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's 
registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, 
the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are 
consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.

Applicants' Conditions

    The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree 
that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the 
following conditions:
    1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth 
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of 
registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by 
the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described 
in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any 
regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are 
qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to 
complete the Substitutions.
    2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a 
sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of 
Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement 
order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio 
without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-
adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to 
rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from 
the Commission.
    3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including 
legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and 
other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the 
affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed 
Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently 
being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed 
Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
    4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.
    5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of 
affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax 
liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the 
Substitutions.
    6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of 
the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract 
owners will not be altered in any way.
    7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one 
transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the 
Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement 
Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available 
investment option under the Contract without charge for a period 
beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at 
least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in 
any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant 
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights 
reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers 
between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on 
the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the 
Substitution Date.
    8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of 
Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended 
Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as 
set forth in Condition 7

[[Page 20671]]

above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to 
affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution 
Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
    9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract 
owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written 
confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the 
Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a 
restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution 
Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.
    10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for 
Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, 
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the 
Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement 
Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual 
operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense 
reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the 
net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most 
recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, 
the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and 
charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the 
Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution 
Date.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.

Annuities Overview














                                                        
                                                       
                                                           What Are Annuities?
                                                        

                                           

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
