Tactical Opportunities
Differentiated Investment Solutions for a Rapidly Evolving Investment Landscape





Overview
Tactical Opportunities (Tac Opps) is an opportunistic investing platform seeking to capitalize on global investment opportunities that are time-sensitive, complex, or in dislocated markets where we believe risk is fundamentally mispriced. 

The Tac Opps’ team invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, and can leverage intellectual capital from across Blackstone’s businesses to inform investment due diligence and execution. Our flexible investment mandate enables us to dynamically adjust to changing market conditions and to focus on deep value opportunities that may be overlooked by less nimble market participants.








				A Message from David Blitzer, Senior Managing Director & Head of Tactical Opportunities
			



















Flexible Mandate

Designed to take advantage of a rapidly evolving investment landscape, we serve as a source of differentiated investment opportunities for our investors and an innovative solution provider to sellers.


 
Breadth
Leveraging the strength of the firm’s global platform, our portfolios provide exposure to timely investment themes across asset classes, industries and geographies.



Nimble and Decisive
Identifying and executing on diverse opportunities requires a broad, deep and experienced perspective balanced by the ability to act in a nimble, decisive manner.






Blackstone's leading alternative asset platform yields compelling insights and synergies that inform our investment decisions.







 Tactical Opportunities  In a world where the most attractive investment opportunities are often short-lived and difficult to source, analyze and execute, Tac Opps is positioned to thrive. Tac Opps is one of the world’s leading opportunistic investment platforms with a dedicated team of 60 professionals who marshal the resources and insights of Blackstone to identify and execute differentiated investments on behalf of our investors. As our investments typically fall outside traditional alternative investment categories, we strive to deliver less correlated returns and lower volatility across our portfolio. 
  




 Our Approach    Investment flexibility Tactical Opportunities’ flexible mandate is designed to allow our team to adjust to changing market circumstances, facilitating the creation of a balanced, complementary portfolio with an attractive overall risk/return profile.   Strong governance The Tactical Opportunities Investment Committee is comprised of the firm’s senior leadership to ensure strong firm-wide collaboration, robust investment analysis and a consistent investment approach.   Taking advantage of synergies The Tactical Opportunities team leverages intellectual capital embedded in businesses that cover every major alternative asset. This enables us to assess and synthesize a broad range of market information into actionable investment ideas.   Focus on managing risk With little tolerance for capital loss, our investment process seeks to identify opportunities with asymmetric return profiles often characterized by downside protection.
