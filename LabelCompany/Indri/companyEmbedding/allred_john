Review 
This is an impressive first step in the career of trombonist John Allred. The son of trombonist Bill Allred, John has a similar style, based in traditional jazz and swing and sometimes hinting at more modern styles. Accompanied by pianist Johnny Varro, bassist David Stone, and drummer Ed Metz Jr., Allred stretches out on three originals (the blues-with-a-bridge "Blues for Rich" is most memorable) and such standards as "Autumn Leaves," Clifford Brown's "Sweet Clifford," and "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You." Betty O'Hara sits in on double-bell euphonium for "Stompin' at the Savoy." Fun and swinging music. ~ Scott Yanow, Rovi
