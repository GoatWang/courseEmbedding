Aum Cardiovascular Inc. has received European regulatory approval to sell a handheld device that can detect blockages in coronary arteries.
The Northfield-based company's stethescope-like CADence System routs acoustic data from a patient's heart through an algorithm that can diagnose blockages. Physicians can use results to decide to decide whether to send patients for further testing.

                            Marie Johnson, CEO of Aum Cardiovascular Inc                        










 


Aum CEO Marie Johnson, an engineer, started the company after her husband died suddenly from a heart attack at age 41.
Aum plans to launch the product in parts of Europe in the coming months. The device has yet to receive U.S. regulatory approval.
The company won the Minnesota Cup business-idea competition in 2011.
