Tom Alberg
Managing Director
Tom is a co-founder of Madrona and is active on several portfolio company boards. Tom has also served on the boards of numerous public and private companies and is a director of Amazon.com on which he has served since before it went public in 1997. Tom serves on the technology industry boards TechNet Northwest and the Washington State Technology Alliance. He was formerly a member of the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. He is also on the Investment Committee of the Seattle Foundation. Ranked number 12 of the 35 most influential business leaders in the Seattle area by Puget Sound Business Journal.  “The most difficult part of my job? Measuring my enthusiasm for every idea I hear. There are a lot of exciting ideas out there.”
Past lives
Immediately prior to co-founding Madrona Investment Group in 1995, Tom served as president of public companies LIN Broadcasting Corporation and Executive Vice President of McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc. Previously, he was chair of the Executive Committee and Partner in the Northwest’s largest law firm, Perkins Coie, where he was principal counsel for The Boeing Company, Alaska Airlines and a number of early technology companies. Before that he was an attorney with Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York.

He was co-chair of the capital campaign for the Computer Science and Engineering Department’s new building at the University of Washington.
Lessons learned
“Not every investment has been a home run. You learn something from each investment, and you apply it to the next one. If you don’t invest in a Home Grocer, you’ll never invest in an Amazon.com. Our ability and willingness to take risks has made us who we are today.”
Extracurricular
In addition to being an avid sailor, Tom joined forces with celebrated winemaker Mike Januik to build the Novelty Hill Januik winery in nearby Woodinville, WA. He was also one of the principal participants in the development the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Seattle.
Education
A graduate of Ballard High School in Seattle, Tom attended Harvard College, where he graduated cum laude. He then received his law degree from Columbia Law School where he was an editor of the Columbia Law Review.

Blow Away Your Competition by Replacing Your Old CRM Program with the New Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM) Model – Part 2: The Necessary Components.


March 18, 2012
4 Comments






1) Introduction:

In my previous blog, I covered what the new Customer Relevant Relationship Model (CRRM) is and the benefits of adopting this new model. In this blog, I will cover the components of the new CRRM model and what you need to put in place to make this new model a reality.


Ever wonder why companies like ESPN, Apple, Google, Zynga, Amazon, and Marriott dominate their respective markets? The reason is that they are ‘Customer First’ organizations and are passionate about listening to, understanding and then delighting their customers based on leveraging true customer insights. They treat their customers as business partners vs. commodities and include them in many critical decision making processes. They get this new CRRM model. Why/how ? – Read the rest of this blog to find out…


The differences between the old CRM model and how these companies are embracing the newer CRRM model are depicted in the following chart:

The Old CRM Model vs. New CRRM Model – Customers as Business Partners
2) Customers are fed up with old Dictatorial Management Style & Want to be Empowered as Business Partners
Customers and stakeholders today are longing for a company to partner with them and include them in the corporate decision making process.  These same constituencies are sick and tired of political, corporate, and other organizations making unilateral decisions for them that are really not in-line with their needs,  wants, etc. The backlash from this unwanted dictatorial management style of some companies can be seen in the Bank of America fee customer rebellion, the customer backlash from Netflix deciding to  split their company without first consulting with their customers and HPs initial decision to exit the computer market.
3) Components of the New CRRM Model:
In order to progress your organization from the old CRM model to the new CRRM  model, a few key essentials must be put in place and are as follows:
A. New CRRM Model that includes the 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights.  This model enables a 360° view of all customer and market insights including customer feedback, preferences, likes, dislikes, social sentiment, competitor activity, etc. This new model takes your insights to an entirely new level whereby you are now enabled to delight customers, stakeholders and stockholders by having insights that are light-years ahead of insights provided by a traditional CRM model.

B. Customer First Culture driven by management that is passionate about their customers including a set of customer first principles and guidelines developed by company leaders

C. Customer Ratings & Feedback Structure that will identify areas where you will collect customer 360° feedback from customer and stakeholder interactions

D. Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process and corresponding infrastructure in order to allow your customers to continually rate how well you are serving them

E. Customer Health Scorecard that provides real-time insights on how well the customers, stakeholders and stockholders perceives you as serving them as well as insights into a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that enables you to continually improve your customer perceptions, satisfaction, brand loyalty, etc.
These components can apply to large enterprises as well as Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs).
The following graphics are all sample components from the list above (A-D) that need to be put in place to enable this new CRRM Model.


New CRRM Model – 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights


 3A) The above chart “New CRRM Model – 360 Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights” demonstrates the new insights model that must be put in place to deliver world-class stakeholder and customer programs. 
These enhanced insights will enable you to deliver products and services that delight your customers, stakeholders and stockholders as well as enable you to leapfrog the competition in terms of market share if they continue to rely on their antiquated CRM data and analytics insights only model.  
For Small to Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), some of the insights do not apply, but the following charts (3B-3E) most certainly apply and can be tracked via simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.



CRRM Customer First Policies & Organizational Principles
3B) The above chart “CRRM Organizational Guiding Principles” demonstrates the principles that must be in-place to be customer first culture. This culture is driven by management that is passionate about their customers and governs the company around a set of customer first policies.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure
3C) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure” illustrates a sample structure (will vary for each type of business) whereby customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Enterprise CRRM Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process
3D) The above chart “CRRM Customer Ratings & Feedback Cultivation Process” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization
3E) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be visually represented in a scorecard. 
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Metrics
3E-2) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be rolled up into an analytical scorecard that provides insights into customer trends,  customer feedback, customer issues, core customer strengths and weaknesses, etc. 
This scorecard can also be used to manage a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that continually drives improvements to customer perceptions, ratings, satisfaction, etc. 
Sample Scorecard for “Shopping Experience”
The above depicts how analytics and metrics would be maintained for a business who had a retail or wholesale shopping function.
Sample Shopping Experience Scorecard – #2
Robust Scorecard Analytics and Metrics should support Customer Trend Identification and Root Cause Analysis for Customer Issues.
Sample Branding & Public Relations Scorecard
Sample Public Relations Scorecard Above gives you insights into how well your company and brands are perceived by customers, stakeholders, stockholders, etc. 
Sample Customer Service Scorecard
Sample Customer Scorecard Above from Customer Service tells how well you are serving your customers.
Sample Marketing Scorecard
Sample Marketing Scorecard Above Gives you insights into how well your Marketing Efforts are resonating with your customers.
Sample Product Management Scorecard
The Sample Product Management Scorecard above gives you insights into how well perceived your products and services are with customers and prospects.
4) Company & Customer Benefits of Adopting the CRRM Model:
By treating customers as business partners (vs. commodities) and including them in the corporate decision making process, as well as allowing them to rate how well you are serving them from an array of customer facing areas, companies can reap huge rewards including the following:
1. Better insights into the types of products and services customers want & need
2. Fiercely loyal customers who feel part of the corporate team
3. Customers who are most likely to spend more, be retained longer and purchase at premium prices with higher profit margins
4. Customers who are very likely to be brand advocates and refer others to your company, brands, and services.
5. Customers who feel connected to the company and empowered to improve company operations
The following are actual customer comments from those who have participated in a customer feedback program to help shape products & services:
“I feel like xyz company cares about me since they ask my opinion”
“Finally a company that listens to us”
“It is so refreshing to have a company ask you your opinions on products and services vs. ramming something down our throats that we don’t like”
“Wow – this is fun. I enjoy providing my opinion”
“As silly as this might sound, xyz company is the only company that ever asked me what I wanted”
“In my opinion, xyz company is much more progressive than their competitors by seeking consumer opinions, what matters to them, etc. 
 5) Conclusion:
More dynamic companies like Goodle, Zynga, Amazon, etc. are inviting customers to become part of the corporate decision making process and empowering them to provide feedback, insights and rate company operations in order to drive continous customer improvements. Companies who adopt this new CRRM model whereby company management is democratized by including stakeholders and customers into the decision making process will reap the rewards of ever higher customer acquisition, retention and spend – leading to ever higher profits and share price.
