 Company Overview
Barrel Energy Inc. is an oil and gas company with a focus on assets located in North America. Currently the company holds oil & gas leases in Alberta, Canada and its strategy is to exploit high impact and development oil plays and liquids-rich deep basin gas plays through the development of its asset base. The company currently holds interest in 2560 acres of oil & gas leases known as the Bison Property. Our near term business strategy is to conduct exploration activities on the Bison Property as laid out in more detail in the “Description of Property” section with the end goal being to achieve positive results during our exploration activities, we believe we will be able to either develop the  Bison Property to commercial production and achieve positive cash flow.
 
 
 
 




 Property
 
 
 


The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land totalling (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west. It is one of only a few large-scale tectonic elements in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that has significantly disturbed the Phanerozoic cover of the craton. The structure has influenced the location of oil and gas accumulations in strata ranging from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Cretaceous, and has long been a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in the region. It is known for its prolific oil, NGL and natural gas wells and is one of the most desirable light oil and natural gas liquids drilling areas in North America.
 
 

The Peace River Arch has already established facilities for natural gas gathering and compression facilities that can be accessed based on Barrel Energy’s needs. Although the Peach River Arch region boasts well established infrastructure weather conditions do play a role in our ability to access the Bison property. For instance the need to helicopter in equipment and or human resources may arise based on location or weather conditions.
 
 
 
 



 GEOLOGY
The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west.
Sediments shed from the Arch, during deposition were deposited in abundance in braided channels, fluvial stream channels and shallow marine environments, which created numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area. Sediments were thickest adjacent to the emergent Arch with sands in of up to 180 feet in total thickness deposited in the braided channel systems coming off the structural highland. Thicknesses decreased to the east away from the source rock ultimately terminating some 75 miles east from the PRA. The Gilwood member at Bison shows approximately 7 feet of gas pay over water in the Gilwood formation and was perforated between 1468.5m and 1470.5m.

Barrel Energy has been nominated as one of the top 100 SME in Dubai out of 75,000 SME
Wednesday, November 6th, 2013

Majid Bin Mohammed honours winners of 2013 Dubai SME100 ranking 
Dubai SME builds on SME100 initiative with ranking of top Start-Ups and High Growth Companies  
 
List of 100 top-performing SMEs for 2013 announced; nominations point to rising SME capabilities and potential
 
Dubai, 6 November 2013: Dubai SME, the agency of the Department of Economic Development (DED) mandated to develop the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, announced the 2013 Dubai SME100 ranking of the 100 top performing SMEs at a special ceremony held today. His Highness Sheikh Majid Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, has honoured the top 10 winners of the 2013 Dubai SME100 ranking of the 100 top performing SMEs.
 
Building on the success of the Dubai SME100 ranking initiative, Dubai SME has also announced plans to launch the ‘Dubai Start-up 100’ and the ‘Dubai High Growth 50.’ The aim of the two new initiatives is to identify high quality companies at various stages of enterprise establishment and growth life cycle.
 
The Dubai SME100 list announced today is the second since the initiative was launched in 2011 under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, to rank SME performance across a set of financial as well as non-financial dimensions.
 
While 1,092 SMEs were nominated for the 2011 ranking, the 2013 ranking attracted more than 3,000 SME applicants, a 178 per cent increase over the first cycle. Based on industry averages, the net output of these SMEs is estimated at about AED 53.3 billion and their total value-add at AED 16.2 billion.
 
The total number of SME applicants in the 2013 ranking represents nearly four per cent of the eligible SMEs with at least three years of operations.  Together, the nominated SMEs also account for a workforce of 93,500.  Sector-wise, 53 per cent of the SMEs nominated are from the trading sector, 36 per cent from services and 11 per cent from manufacturing.
For the top 100 SMEs, the net combined turnover exceeds AED 4.5 billion, which is an increase of over 100 per cent from the 2011 ranking, and profit exceeds AED 434 million, 98 per cent higher than the 2011 batch of SMEs. The top 100 also employ more than 7,000 among them and the productivity per worker is more than AED 636,000, a 22 per cent increase over 2011.
 
Sector wise, 60 of the top 100 SMEs are in the services, 26 from the trading and 14 from the manufacturing sectors.   In the 2013 ranking SMEs that achieved double-digit revenue growth over the last three years are 81, a 53 per cent growth from the 53 such SMEs in the 2011 list. A 32 per cent increase (from 41 SMEs in 2011 to 54 in 2013) is also seen in terms of companies that achieved more than 20 per cent growth over the last three years.
 
The number of SMEs that achieved double-digit growth in net profits also has increased 48 per cent in 2013 to reach 71 from 48 in the previous list. The employee count was more than 100 in 24 of the top 100 SMEs in 2013, a growth of almost 140 per cent over the 10 SMEs that fell under this category in 2011.
 
Commented His Excellency Sami Al Qamzi, Director General of DED: “The Dubai SME100 initiative has truly made its mark in recognising Dubai’s top SMEs.  These SMEs have made a difference to the Dubai business and economic landscape.  I am proud of their entrepreneurial spirit and ambition to grow.  I congratulate the top 100 SMEs, and wish them a great future.”
 
Abdul Baset Al Janahi, Chief Executive Officer of Dubai SME, added: “The Dubai SME100 initiative has gained momentum and market recognition and I am delighted that a better crop of quality SMEs made it to the 2013 ranking.   These SMEs represent the Dubai Story and the spirit of dynamism, tenacity and an eye for opportunity.  I congratulate the ranked SMEs and hope more SMEs will come forward to apply in the future rankings.  The ranking process is just the beginning of the SME journey to grow and move to the next level.”
 
Similar to the Dubai SME100, the Dubai Start-up 100 and the Dubai High Growth 50 will involve grading 100 start-ups and the top 50 of them being given relevant upgrading and growth opportunities that suit their needs, aspirations and growth potential.
 
The two new initiatives will be launched in the first quarter of 2014, and the rankings will be announced in November and December 2014 respectively.  Post ranking, Dubai SME along with its partners will develop and execute capability programmes to take the firms to the next level of growth and development.  Each will be account-managed for focused assistance over a two-year period. More details of the two initiatives will be announced in January 2014.
 
“Dubai SME is keen to identify and recognise the performance and contribution of SMEs to the UAE economy, especially those enterprises that began their journey in Dubai.  We hope that as many start-ups and high growth firms will be nominated for the two new rankings.  I am confident that the new initiatives along with Dubai SME100 will lead to substantial capacity building and value-add for these start-ups and high-growth companies,” added Al Janahi.
 
The proposed evaluation dimensions for the Dubai Start-Up 100 would cover, but not limited to, Entrepreneurial quotient; Quality of Business Plan; New market creation with innovative products, services or business model; Customer acquisition and retention; Supplier/partnerships management; Operations Management capabilities; Scalability potential and Investment attraction premium.
 
For the Dubai High Growth 50 the proposed evaluation dimensions would include sustainable financial growth with a high CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) over a three-year period, among many others.
 
About Dubai SME:
Dubai SME, an agency of the Department of Economic Development (DED), Government of Dubai, aims to foster an entrepreneurial culture and develop a competitive SME sector for the Emirate of Dubai. The key strategies adopted by Dubai SME are: advocate a pro-business environment for developing entrepreneurship and SMEs, seed innovative start-ups and groom promising SMEs.  Dubai SME’s vision is to make Dubai the centre for innovative SMEs to start, grow and expand their businesses, thus adding greater value to the economy of Dubai.




Barrel Energy Renew contract with PDC
Thursday, April 2nd, 2009


6 May 2009 
 
Palm District Cooling renews fuel supply contract with Barrel Energy 
Palm Utilities (PU), the water and district cooling utility service provider established by government-owned
investment firm Istithmar, a major investment holding and part of the Dubai World group of companies, has
announced that Palm District Cooling (PDC) has recently renewed its partnership with Barrel Energy L.L.C., a
leading Dubai-based fuel supply management and lubricants service company. 
 
 
 
 
The move underscores PDC’s strong commitment to support the Mohammed Bin Rashid 
Establishment for Young Business Leaders, a government program that facilitates the 
development of business and entrepreneurial activity among UAE nationals, of which Barrel 
Energy is a member. 
Barrel Energy has supplied over Dhs100m or nearly 7 million IG (Imperial Gallons) of fuel to 
PDC and has also delivered logistics management services to PDC’s district cooling station 
since 2007, supporting the temporary cooling service provided to customers. At its peak, Barrel 
Energy delivered up to 1 million IG of fuel a month to PDC; the company has also served most 
of its project sites including Palm Jumeira, Discovery Gardens, and Jumeira Lake Towers, and 
has also been a key supplier of other government and non-government entities. 
Mohammed Abulhoul, Founder and Managing Director, Barrel Energy L.L.C., said, “It is certainly 
an honour for us to be a business partner of Palm District Cooling, which has distinguished itself 
as a world-class provider of district cooling services in the country. Barrel Energy is fully 

committed to support Palm District Cooling in its growing business ventures across the UAE 
market by maintaining the highest quality standards in the delivery of our products and services.” 
Shafiq Khoori, Managing Director, Palm District Cooling, said: 
“Barrel Energy has been a very dedicated and quality-oriented business partner 
of Palm District Cooling. We are thus pleased to renew our partnership with them 
as their professionalism and strong work ethic are important qualities that will help 
us further raise the standards of our services and consolidate our portfolio of high- 
stakes projects.” 
 
PDC currently provides district cooling services to several prestigious mega developments in 
the UAE, including the Gardens Residential Complex, Jumeirah Islands, Discovery Gardens 
and Palm Jumeirah Trunk. PDC is also renowned for being a socially responsible company and 
a leading innovator in the district cooling industry. 
Palm Utilities, through PDC and Palm Water (PW), has been established to address the region’s 
unique requirements in the distinctly critical areas of district cooling, and wastewater treatment. 
PU has revealed that it is exploring possible joint venture initiatives for other utility projects in 
the Middle East, India and across Asia as part of its growth strategy for 2009.

Given the highly competitive nature of the oil & gas sector and our company
being a new exploration stage company we face competition from numerous
competitors within in the industry. We compete with junior and senior oil and
gas companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors
who are actively seeking to acquire oil and gas properties throughout North
America. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas interests is strong with
many oil and gas leases available in a competitive bidding process in which we
may lack the financial and technological information or expertise to compete
with all competitors.

Our competitor oil and gas companies with which we compete for financing and for
the acquisition of oil and gas properties have greater financial and technical
resources than those available to us. These competitors may be able to spend
greater amounts on acquiring oil and gas interests of merit or on exploring or
developing their oil and gas properties. This advantage could enable our
competitors to acquire oil and gas properties of greater quality and interest to
prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and
development. The potential for this competition could adversely impact our
ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further oil and gas
interests or explore and develop our current or future oil and gas properties.

In addition we compete with other junior oil and gas companies for financing
from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in companies such
as ours, and this may limit our ability to raise future capital. In addition, we
compete with both junior and senior oil and gas companies for available
resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land
specialists, engineers, helicopters, float planes, oil and gas exploration
supplies and drill rigs.

			The Energy in a Barrel of Oil	

 

In grasping the challenge of peak oil, it took us a while to come to grips with what a bonanza our treasure of oil has provided for us humans. Hey, let’s be honest: we still don’t get it, and if you’re a typical human, we understand it a lot better than you. So let’s think about how much energy there is in a barrel of oil.
A barrel of oil contains 42 gallons. The quality of oil varies. The purest and easiest to refine is labeled “sweet,” and the more sulfur-laden and more challenging to refine is labeled “sour.” We humans have already used up most of the sweet oil and we’re mostly down to sour oil, by the way, but that’s not the focus of this page. The focus of this page is how much energy there is in an average barrel of oil.
A barrel of oil contains about six gigajoules of energy. That’s six billion joules or 1667 kilowatt-hours. No, we don’t have any idea how much that is, either, so let’s think about the equivalent. Sit a reasonably healthy male adult – let’s call him Jim – on an exercise bike wired to an efficient generator, and he can produce 100 watts for you. So after Jim has pedaled an hour he’s produced 100 watt hours of energy, or 1/10 of a kw-hour.
To produce the same energy as that in a gallon of gasoline, 33 kilowatt-hours, Jim would need to pedal 33 X 10 = 330 hours. We need to be legal, of course, so Jim only pedals 40 hours per week. Jim’s desperate, so let’s assume he agrees to take no breaks and never stops working to chat at the water cooler or to check in with his friends on Facebook. He pedals straight through for 40 hours per week. He will have pedaled enough to equal the energy in a gallon of gasoline in a little more than eight weeks. Because Jim’s desperate, he gladly works for minimum wage, so your energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline is a bargain at $6.55 X 330 = $2,194. How’s the price of gasoline lookin’?
Jim likes working for you, so let’s ask him to pedal long enough to produce the same energy as that in a barrel of oil, 1667 kw-hours. Easy to figure. 1667 divided by 1/10, or to say it another way, 1,667 X 10, or 16,667 hours of pedaling. That’s 417 weeks. Jim must love pedaling that bike, because he never takes a vacation. Jim will have pedaled enough to produce the energy in a barrel of oil in 417 divided by 52 = 8.01 years. Congress has cooperated with you during this entire adventure and kept the minimum wage stable at $6.55 per hour, so your energy equivalent from Jim will cost you only $6.55 X 16,667 = $109,169.
You’ll never remember $2,194 or $109,169. We sure don’t. Cheat down. Remember $2,000 per gallon of gas and $100,000 per barrel of oil. Those you can remember.

What is crude oil and what are petroleum products?
Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons that formed from  plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Crude oil is a fossil  fuel, and it exists in liquid form in underground pools or reservoirs, in tiny  spaces within sedimentary rocks, and near the surface in tar (or oil) sands. Petroleum  products are fuels made from crude oil and other hydrocarbons contained in  natural gas. Petroleum products can also be made from coal, natural gas, and biomass.
Products made from  crude oil
After crude oil is removed from the ground, it is sent to a refinery where different parts of the crude oil are separated into useable petroleum products. These petroleum products include gasoline, distillates such as diesel fuel and heating oil, jet fuel, petrochemical  feedstocks, waxes, lubricating oils, and asphalt.
A U.S 42-gallon barrel of crude oil yields about 45 gallons of petroleum products in U.S. refineries because of refinery processing gain. This increase in volume is similar to what happens to popcorn when it is popped.

How was crude oil formed? 
Crude oil was formed from the remains of animals and plants (diatoms) that lived millions of years ago in a marine environment before the existence of dinosaurs. Over millions of years, the remains of these animals and plants were covered by layers of sand, silt, and rock. Heat and pressure from these layers turned the remains into what we now call crude oil.  The word petroleum means rock oil or oil from the earth.

Welcome to

 Company Overview
Barrel Energy Inc. is an oil and gas company with a focus on assets located in North America. Currently the company holds oil & gas leases in Alberta, Canada and its strategy is to exploit high impact and development oil plays and liquids-rich deep basin gas plays through the development of its asset base. The company currently holds interest in 2560 acres of oil & gas leases known as the Bison Property. Our near term business strategy is to conduct exploration activities on the Bison Property as laid out in more detail in the “Description of Property” section with the end goal being to achieve positive results during our exploration activities, we believe we will be able to either develop the  Bison Property to commercial production and achieve positive cash flow.
 
 
 
 




 Property
 
 
 


The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land totalling (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west. It is one of only a few large-scale tectonic elements in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that has significantly disturbed the Phanerozoic cover of the craton. The structure has influenced the location of oil and gas accumulations in strata ranging from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Cretaceous, and has long been a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in the region. It is known for its prolific oil, NGL and natural gas wells and is one of the most desirable light oil and natural gas liquids drilling areas in North America.
 
 

The Peace River Arch has already established facilities for natural gas gathering and compression facilities that can be accessed based on Barrel Energy’s needs. Although the Peach River Arch region boasts well established infrastructure weather conditions do play a role in our ability to access the Bison property. For instance the need to helicopter in equipment and or human resources may arise based on location or weather conditions.
 
 
 
 



 GEOLOGY
The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west.
Sediments shed from the Arch, during deposition were deposited in abundance in braided channels, fluvial stream channels and shallow marine environments, which created numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area. Sediments were thickest adjacent to the emergent Arch with sands in of up to 180 feet in total thickness deposited in the braided channel systems coming off the structural highland. Thicknesses decreased to the east away from the source rock ultimately terminating some 75 miles east from the PRA. The Gilwood member at Bison shows approximately 7 feet of gas pay over water in the Gilwood formation and was perforated between 1468.5m and 1470.5m.
