Buying Info

Bianchi is recognized worldwide for the innovation and high quality found in their products. Bianchi Holsters, Bianchi Belts and Bianchi Holster Accessories are made from the best materials and incorporate the latest designs and technology. Bianchi was started almost 50 years ago by John Bianchi, a California police officer who wanted a more effective holster to use on duty. From that original holster to the latest model, the focus on great quality and performance has never wavered. All Bianchi duty gear is based on the principles set down by John Bianchi to carefully handcraft and innovate the best products using the best materials. If you have any questions about which Bianchi holster or belt is right for you, contact us and one of our product specialists will help you find the right option for you!
Bianchi has long been an innovator. Thumb snaps on holsters, which are now a common feature from most brands, were first developed by Bianchi International. Thumb snaps give police officers the ability to smoothly draw their firearm while also securing the firearm from removal by an assailant. Not a company to rest on their laurels, Bianchi continue to branch out and innovate, so when the military needed a concealed shoulder holster during the 1960s, the Bianchi X15 Shoulder Holster was born. The development of the X15, which is still copied by other companies today, led to Bianchi branching out into more concealed carry options, which today makes up a large portion of their business. Bianchi holsters are used worldwide by law enforcement, military and hunters because of their amazing performance, durability and lasting value.

Buying Info

Bianchi is recognized worldwide for the innovation and high quality found in their products. Bianchi Holsters, Bianchi Belts and Bianchi Holster Accessories are made from the best materials and incorporate the latest designs and technology. Bianchi was started almost 50 years ago by John Bianchi, a California police officer who wanted a more effective holster to use on duty. From that original holster to the latest model, the focus on great quality and performance has never wavered. All Bianchi duty gear is based on the principles set down by John Bianchi to carefully handcraft and innovate the best products using the best materials. If you have any questions about which Bianchi holster or belt is right for you, contact us and one of our product specialists will help you find the right option for you!
Bianchi has long been an innovator. Thumb snaps on holsters, which are now a common feature from most brands, were first developed by Bianchi International. Thumb snaps give police officers the ability to smoothly draw their firearm while also securing the firearm from removal by an assailant. Not a company to rest on their laurels, Bianchi continue to branch out and innovate, so when the military needed a concealed shoulder holster during the 1960s, the Bianchi X15 Shoulder Holster was born. The development of the X15, which is still copied by other companies today, led to Bianchi branching out into more concealed carry options, which today makes up a large portion of their business. Bianchi holsters are used worldwide by law enforcement, military and hunters because of their amazing performance, durability and lasting value.
