InSync currently supports more than 30 VMS program customers with employees in over 40 states.
inSync Staffing’s management team recognized the inevitable changes to the staffing industry being brought about by technology and the growing trend of Fortune 1000 corporations to outsource management of their contingent workforces to meet compliance and cost control goals. Rather than swim upstream against the changes, InSync Staffing has embraced MSP and VMS programs as our customers, not competitors. We have structured inSync Staffing as a recruiting and customer service organization, unlike traditional staffing companies who sell directly to the end client. inSync delivery model allows us to concentrate our resources on how to best supply candidates in a very competitive MSP/VMS program environment.
inSync's Philosophy is:
• Built around recognizing your program management team as our customer, not a competitor or a gatekeeper to work around.
• To be focused on recruiting for programs and not managing them, so we have no conflicts of interest with you — our customer.
• To be as operationally efficient as possible to provide cost savings to our customers while running a sustainable business.

Consolidated operating income for the first quarter, decreased by 25% to $16.2 million, compared to $21.5 million in the same period last year. The decrease in operating income is attributable to Sapiens' operating income decreasing from $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2016 to an operating loss of $1.6 million due to the halt of a software development project with a significant customer of Sapiens and the integration of StoneRiver, Sapiens recent acquisition. Consolidated net income attributable to company shareholders for the first quarter was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per fully diluted share, compared to $4.1 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share, in the same period last year. The decrease in net income attributable to company shareholders is primarily attributable to a decrease in Sapiens net income from $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2016 to a loss of $2.2 million and to devaluation of long term liabilities to banks and others denominated in New Israeli Shekels following the erosion of the US dollar against the new Israeli shekel amounting to $3.5 million.

History[edit]
Formula Systems was founded in 1985 by Dan Goldstein and his brother Gad.[2][3] Dan Goldstein, who had an undergraduate degree in math and computer science and a master's in business management, had been a doctoral student at Tel Aviv University when, in 1981, he decided to leave the academic world and direct his efforts toward the private sector instead. He established a software company, which he called Formula Software Solutions, serving such clients as Egged and Mekorot, and recruited brother Gad Goldstein to work alongside him. Soon the two co-founded Formula Systems, as well as many other technology companies. Until 1998, the company established its position as a technology oriented holding company. As such, it created, developed and invested in a number of the early companies, floated and traded on Nasdaq such as BluePhoenix, Wiztech, Matrix, Sapiens International Corporation and many others. In 1998 Formula Systems acquired control of the Mashov Group, including assets such as Magic Software Enterprises, Walla!, Paradigm Geophysical, Babylon (software) and others. In 2005, Dan Goldstein separated Formula Systems into two separate entities, by spinning off all the young start-up companies under Mashov Computers, which he renamed Formula Vision. Goldstein sold his share in Formula Systems to the Emblaze Group, and dedicated himself to the cultivation of several struggling yet promising start-ups. [4]
In 2006, 33.6% of Formula was owned by Emblaze Group.[5] In late 2010, Polish software maker Asseco, a subsidiary of Asseco Group, acquired a 50.2% stake in Formula Systems.[6][7]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Formula Systems' portfolio has changed over the years, but always with an emphasis on software engineering. At various times it included Magic Software Enterprises, Crystal Systems, Liraz, Sivan, Martix IT, Sapiens International Corporation, New Applicom, Sintec, nextSource, and BluePhoenix Solutions.[8][9][10] As of fiscal year 2010, Formula retains a majority interest in three public companies: Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (71.6%), Magic Software Enterprises (51.7%), and Matrix (50.1%).[11]

Formula Systems Reports First Quarter Results for 2016 According to International Financial Reporting StandardsBack to FORTY Snapshot

Share Story5:27AM ET 6/22/2016 PRNewswire



OR YEHUDA, Israel, June 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Formula Systems (1985) Ltd. (NASDAQ: FORTY), a global information technology holding company engaged primarily, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, in providing software consulting services and computer-based business solutions and developing proprietary software, today announced its results for the first quarter of 2016 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
In accordance with Formula's May 2016 announcement that it will report its financial results under IFRS as of January 1, 2016 (date of adoption), the company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the comparative periods of 2015 are also reported under IFRS. Up until the most recent reporting period, Formula's reporting was based on US GAAP. 
The main difference between IFRS and US GAAP reporting, as it applies to the Company, relates to the consolidation of the results of operations of subsidiaries. Under US GAAP, companies are evaluated for consolidation purposes based on voting interests, to determine whether the reporting entity controls and therefore consolidates them. Under US GAAP, the majority voting interest holder of a company (i.e., ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of an entity) consolidates that company. Upon transitioning to reporting based on IFRS, the Company consolidated the results of operations of Sapiens International Corporation N.V. and Magic Software Enterprises Ltd. over which it has effective control ("de facto control"), as required under IFRS. "De facto control" exists when the Company's rights in such entities are sufficient to give it power to have the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of such entities even where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power therein. The Company believes that consolidating the results of operations of entities over which it has "de facto control" provides more consistency in accounting treatment and financial reporting over future periods, whether or not the Company's interests in these entities exceeds 50% (but provided that, and for as long as, it has "de facto control" over such entities). The concept of "de facto control" does not exist under US GAAP. The Company believes that this change provides shareholders with information that better reflects the Company's operations through the subsidiaries that it effectively controls.  
Financial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2016 (in accordance with IFRS)
Consolidated revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, increased 11% to $262.2 million, compared to $237.1 million in the same period last year. 
Consolidated operating income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, increased 7% to $21.5 million, compared to $20.2 million in the same period last year.  
Consolidated net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was $4.0 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share, compared to $6.5 million, or $0.44 per fully diluted share, in the same period last year. Net income was negatively impacted by increased tax expenses recorded in Magic Software and in Sapiens and the appreciation of Formula's debentures nominated in New Israel Shekels as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. 
As of March 31, 2016, Formula held 50.0%, 49.0% and 47.3% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Matrix, Sapiens and Magic, respectively.  
Consolidated cash and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities totaled approximately $325.1 million as of March 31, 2016.  
Total consolidated equity as of March 31, 2016, was $717.1 million (representing 58% of the total balance sheet). 
As of March 31, 2016, Formula was in compliance with all of its financial covenants.Comments of Management
Commenting on the results, Guy Bernstein, CEO of Formula Systems, said, "We are very pleased to report another quarter of excellent results across our entire portfolio. Sapiens' revenues grew by 20.9% to $49.6 million for the first quarter. In addition, Sapiens launched several products including its new advanced analytics solution, Sapiens INTELLIGENCE, thereby continuing to expand its revenue base and enhance its competitive position. Matrix reported a tremendous first quarter, improving both its top and bottom line. Matrix's growth is a direct result of having strategically identified future growth engines and executing its growth plan by investing in its offerings and infrastructure to target these high growth segments. Magic reported another quarter with double-digit revenue growth year over year while maintaining operational profitability at a solid 15%. Magic continues to invest in its products, receiving very positive customer feedback and strong uptake for its solutions, including its professional services for cloud and mobility solutions. We are looking forward to adding the results of our 50% stake in TSG – formerly a subsidiary and the military arm of Ness Technologies, which we acquired in equal parts with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) during May 2016. Engaged in the fields of command and control systems, intelligence, homeland security and cyber security, TSG adds a valuable fourth leg to our portfolio."

Formula Systems' former Headquarters in Herzliya


Formula Systems (Hebrew: פורמולה מערכות‎‎) is a publicly traded holding company headquartered in Or Yehuda, Israel. Through its subsidiaries it operates mainly in the area of information technology. Shares of Formula Systems are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In 2010 Polish software maker Asseco acquired a 50.2% stake in the company.

History[edit]
Formula Systems was founded in 1985 by Dan Goldstein and his brother Gad.[2][3] Dan Goldstein, who had an undergraduate degree in math and computer science and a master's in business management, had been a doctoral student at Tel Aviv University when, in 1981, he decided to leave the academic world and direct his efforts toward the private sector instead. He established a software company, which he called Formula Software Solutions, serving such clients as Egged and Mekorot, and recruited brother Gad Goldstein to work alongside him. Soon the two co-founded Formula Systems, as well as many other technology companies. Until 1998, the company established its position as a technology oriented holding company. As such, it created, developed and invested in a number of the early companies, floated and traded on Nasdaq such as BluePhoenix, Wiztech, Matrix, Sapiens International Corporation and many others. In 1998 Formula Systems acquired control of the Mashov Group, including assets such as Magic Software Enterprises, Walla!, Paradigm Geophysical, Babylon (software) and others. In 2005, Dan Goldstein separated Formula Systems into two separate entities, by spinning off all the young start-up companies under Mashov Computers, which he renamed Formula Vision. Goldstein sold his share in Formula Systems to the Emblaze Group, and dedicated himself to the cultivation of several struggling yet promising start-ups. [4]
In 2006, 33.6% of Formula was owned by Emblaze Group.[5] In late 2010, Polish software maker Asseco, a subsidiary of Asseco Group, acquired a 50.2% stake in Formula Systems.[6][7]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Formula Systems' portfolio has changed over the years, but always with an emphasis on software engineering. At various times it included Magic Software Enterprises, Crystal Systems, Liraz, Sivan, Martix IT, Sapiens International Corporation, New Applicom, Sintec, nextSource, and BluePhoenix Solutions.[8][9][10] As of fiscal year 2010, Formula retains a majority interest in three public companies: Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (71.6%), Magic Software Enterprises (51.7%), and Matrix (50.1%).[11]

History[edit]
Formula Systems was founded in 1985 by Dan Goldstein and his brother Gad.[2][3] Dan Goldstein, who had an undergraduate degree in math and computer science and a master's in business management, had been a doctoral student at Tel Aviv University when, in 1981, he decided to leave the academic world and direct his efforts toward the private sector instead. He established a software company, which he called Formula Software Solutions, serving such clients as Egged and Mekorot, and recruited brother Gad Goldstein to work alongside him. Soon the two co-founded Formula Systems, as well as many other technology companies. Until 1998, the company established its position as a technology oriented holding company. As such, it created, developed and invested in a number of the early companies, floated and traded on Nasdaq such as BluePhoenix, Wiztech, Matrix, Sapiens International Corporation and many others. In 1998 Formula Systems acquired control of the Mashov Group, including assets such as Magic Software Enterprises, Walla!, Paradigm Geophysical, Babylon (software) and others. In 2005, Dan Goldstein separated Formula Systems into two separate entities, by spinning off all the young start-up companies under Mashov Computers, which he renamed Formula Vision. Goldstein sold his share in Formula Systems to the Emblaze Group, and dedicated himself to the cultivation of several struggling yet promising start-ups. [4]
In 2006, 33.6% of Formula was owned by Emblaze Group.[5] In late 2010, Polish software maker Asseco, a subsidiary of Asseco Group, acquired a 50.2% stake in Formula Systems.[6][7]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Formula Systems' portfolio has changed over the years, but always with an emphasis on software engineering. At various times it included Magic Software Enterprises, Crystal Systems, Liraz, Sivan, Martix IT, Sapiens International Corporation, New Applicom, Sintec, nextSource, and BluePhoenix Solutions.[8][9][10] As of fiscal year 2010, Formula retains a majority interest in three public companies: Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (71.6%), Magic Software Enterprises (51.7%), and Matrix (50.1%).[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
