Robust development pipeline

 
 
Our pipeline includes three internally discovered humanized monoclonal antibodies, as well as preclinical programs targeting additional indications that are in the discovery phase.
Eptinezumab
Eptinezumab is our lead pivotal-stage investigational product candidate being developed as a migraine prevention treatment for patients with chronic and frequent episodic migraine. Eptinezumab, discovered by Alder, is a novel monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, a small protein involved in the transmission of, and heightened sensitivity to, pain experienced in migraine.
Migraine is a significant cause of disability worldwide, generally affecting individuals between the ages of 20 and 50, which are peak productive years. The Migraine Research Foundation estimates U.S. employers lose more than USD$13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost workdays due to migraine. A preventive therapy for these patients is a critical unmet medical need, as they have few therapeutic options.
Eptinezumab Clinical Data
Data from our Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with frequent episodic migraine and from our Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with chronic migraine established that a single administration of eptinezumab significantly reduced the number of days in which the study patients experienced migraines.  In each of these studies, we observed a rapid onset and sustained 12-week migraine prevention after a single treatment with eptinezumab.

In our Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, 27-41% of frequent episodic migraine patients experienced complete migraine-free relief, that is 100% suppression of migraine occurrence, in any given month and migraines were completely prevented in 16% of patients for the entire 12 week study period. View results
In our Phase 2b clinical trial, 33% and 31% of chronic migraine patients dosed with 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively, of eptinezumab experienced a 75% decrease in their migraines over the 12 week study period from an average of 16 or more migraine days per month.  In addition, a single administration of eptinezumab resulted in an immediate and durable mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 12 weeks at the 300mg, 100mg and 30mg dose levels, meeting the secondary efficacy endpoint. View results

We have also completed a multi-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized, quarterly-dosing Phase 1 study comparing the intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy volunteers. The study demonstrated that eptinezumab provided a comparable level of suppression of peripheral CGRP biology for a full 3 months when administered via a single intravenous (100 mg), subcutaneous (100 mg) or intramuscular injection (100 mg or 300 mg), supporting a quarterly dosing strategy as a single injection by all modes of administration.
Eptinezumab Pivotal Trial Program
The eptinezumab pivotal trial program includes three Phase 3 trials:

PROMISE 1 (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1) is an 800-patient double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose trial. The study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of three dose levels of eptinezumab versus placebo, administered by infusion once every 12 weeks for one year in patients living with frequent episodic migraine. Completion of PROMISE 1 enrollment was announced in October 2016.


PROMISE 2 (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2) is a 1,050-patient double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-dose trial. This study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of eptinezumab versus placebo, administered by infusion once every 12 weeks in patients living with chronic migraine. Initiation of PROMISE 2 was announced in November 2016.


An open-label extension study is evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab. This study will enroll approximately 120 patients that will receive eptinezumab administered by infusion every 12 weeks for one year. It was initiated in late 2016.

The primary endpoint for PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2 is the mean reduction in migraine days from baseline over weeks 1-12. Key secondary endpoints for PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2 are the 75% responder rate over weeks 1 to 12 as determined by the change in migraine days between eptinezumab and placebo, and the 75% responder rate over weeks 1 to 4 as determined by the change in migraine days between eptinezumab and placebo.
Clazakizumab
Clazakizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6, or IL-6. Clazakizumab has been administered in clinical trials involving over one thousand patients, and has demonstrated positive results in Phase 2b trials evaluating patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Alder licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to clazakizumab to Vitaeris Inc. which will pursue innovative therapeutic indications in chronic inflammatory diseases.
ALD1910
ALD1910 is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody discovered and designed by Alder to specifically inhibit pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide-38, or PACAP-38, a protein active in mediating the initiation of migraine. We believe ALD1910 holds potential as a migraine prevention treatment for those who have an inadequate response to therapeutics directed at calcitonin gene related peptide, or CGRP, and could provide an important new therapeutic option to migraine patients and their physicians.
ALD1910 is currently undergoing Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling preclinical studies.  Similar to our other internally developed product candidates, ALD1910 is designed to have favorable antibody properties and a desirable product profile we consider critical to a streamlined development path.

Alder BioPharmaceuticals Announces Positive Eptinezumab Phase 3 Results for Prevention of Frequent Episodic Migraine

-- Pivotal PROMISE 1 top-line results show eptinezumab met primary and key secondary endpoints -- -- Beginning day 1 after first dose significant reduction in proportion of patients experiencing migraine -- -- Average of 1 in 5 patients had no migraines in any given month over months 1 through 6 -- -- Conference call to be held today, June 27, at 8:00 a.m., ET -- BOTHELL, Wash., June  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., (NASDAQ:ALDR) today announced that eptinezumab, its lead product candidate for migraine prevention, met the primary and key secondary endpoints in PROMISE 1, a Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic migraine.   PROMISE 1 Highlights PROMISE 1 met the primary endpoint: highly statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days;Significant Day 1 clinical benefit: ≥50% reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing a migraine on Day 1 post-dose;Significant 75% responses at all key time points: ~1/3 of patients achieved a ≥75% reduction in migraine days through 4 and 12 weeks;Average of 1 in 5 patients had 100% response: no migraines in any given month, months 1 through 6; andThe safety profile was similar to placebo: consistent with previously reported eptinezumab studies. "Approximately 13 million people suffer from the pain and debilitation of migraines that occur four or more days a month, yet nine out of 10 individuals don't utilize preventive therapy due to limitations in efficacy, safety and tolerability," said Roger Cady, MD, Alder Vice President of Neurology and Fellow of the American Headache Society. "Patients deserve more from their treatments, and these data show eptinezumab could be a major advance in meeting the significant unmet need for patients to regain control of their lives." PROMISE 1 Top-Line ResultsThe primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days from baseline (average of 8.6 days) over weeks 1 through 12 was 4.3 monthly migraine days for 300mg (p=0.0001) and 3.9 days for 100mg (p=0.0179) compared to an average 3.2 days for placebo. A 30mg dose level evaluated in the study was not tested as per the statistical analysis plan. Secondary endpoints evaluating time points through the first quarterly dose include: ≥75% reduction in monthly migraine days achieved over weeks 1 through 4 of 31.5% for 300mg and (p=0.0066), and 30.8% for 100mg (p=0.0112) compared to 20.3% for placebo.≥75% reduction in monthly migraine days achieved over weeks 1 through 12 of 29.7% for 300mg (p=0.0007), and 22.2% for 100mg (not statistically significant) compared to 16.2% for placebo.≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days achieved by 56.3% of patients over weeks 1 through 12 for 300mg (p=0.0001) and 49.8% for 100mg (p=0.0085, unadjusted) compared to 37.4% for placebo.53.6% reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing migraine on the day following administration at 300mg (p=0.0087, unadjusted), and 51.3% at 100mg (p=0.0167, unadjusted), compared to 20.7% for placebo Secondary endpoints demonstrated responses that were improved through the second quarterly dose period, and include: ≥75% reduction in monthly migraine days achieved over weeks 13 through 24 of 40.1% for 300mg (p=0.0006, unadjusted), and 33.5% for 100mg (p=0.0434, unadjusted) compared to 24.8% for placebo.Average of one in five patients receiving 300mg (20.6%) had 100% responses with no migraines in any given month (months 1 through 6). The observed safety profile in this study to date was similar to placebo. Both the safety profile and the placebo rates were consistent with previously reported eptinezumab studies. Full safety data will be available at the end of the study. "Alder's goal is to discover and develop best-in-class therapies that have the potential to transform the lives of the millions of underserved patients who are seeking long-term freedom from their migraines," said Alder President and Chief Executive Officer Randy Schatzman, Ph.D. "These positive results, consistent with previously reported eptinezumab studies, support the unique clinical profile of eptinezumab as a potential first-of-its-kind infusion therapy to prevent migraines. Enrollment is on track for PROMISE 2, our second pivotal Phase 3 study that focuses on chronic migraine, and we remain on track to submit our BLA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2018." Migraine is a disabling neurological disease.1 Current preventive treatments for migraine are challenged by safety, efficacy, and tolerability limitations and fail to meet the needs of most patients.2,3  Migraine preventive treatments can take weeks to months to achieve meaningful clinical benefit and, subsequently, most patients discontinue within 6 months to 1 year due to lack of efficacy and/or side effects.3,4 The eptinezumab development program was designed to redefine physician and patient expectations for migraine prevention. This includes early, meaningful, sustained migraine prevention including the opportunity for patients to experience long periods of migraine freedom.  About PROMISE 1 and 2 PROMISE 1 (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous eptinezumab Safety and Efficacy 1) is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab (300mg, 100mg or 30mg) administered by intravenous infusion once every 12 weeks through week 24. The study continues for an additional 2 doses every 12 weeks with follow up through week 56. The study enrolled 888 patients diagnosed with frequent episodic migraine. The primary endpoint for PROMISE 1 was the mean change in monthly migraine days from baseline (28-day run-in period) for weeks 1 through 12. Key secondary endpoints included the percent of patients who achieved ≥75% reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline over weeks 1 through 4 and weeks 1 through 12.  Patients enrolled in the study experienced, on average, 8.6 migraines days per month. Alder expects to complete enrollment in PROMISE 2, which is being conducted in patients with chronic migraine, later this year. Top-line data for that study are expected in the first half of 2018. Together, the results of PROMISE 1, PROMISE 2, and an open-label safety study will support a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the FDA for eptinezumab, which Alder plans to file in the second half of 2018. About Eptinezumab Eptinezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody discovered and developed by Alder BioPharmaceuticals for migraine prevention. Eptinezumab is administered quarterly via infusion that allows for 100% of the dose available to selectively and potently inhibit CGRP.5  Eptinezumab is currently in multiple global, randomized pivotal, Phase 3 studies to assess its efficacy and safety in migraine prevention. About Migraine1,2,3 Migraine affects 36 million Americans and is considered the 6th most disabling disease in the world. It is a disabling neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivities to light and sound. The occurrence of migraine can be unpredictable with a profound impact on activities of daily living. This disease can last decades, often during what should be the most productive years of patients' lives. Migraine can remit or progress to chronic migraine over time and persist as chronic migraine for years or decades, but it commonly oscillates between periods of frequent episodic and chronic migraine. Current preventive treatments for migraine fail to meet the needs of most patients and there is a significant need for new, effective, and well-tolerated treatment options. Conference Call and WebcastAlder will host a conference call and live audio webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss PROMISE 1 top-line data. The live call may be accessed by dialing (877) 430-4657 for domestic callers or (484) 756 4339 for international callers, and providing conference ID number 46152061. The webcast and accompanying slides may be accessed from the Events & Presentations page in the Investors section of Alder's website at www.alderbio.com and will be available for replay following the call for 30 days. About Alder BioPharmaceuticalsAlder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the treatment paradigm for patients with migraine and other serious neurological or inflammatory conditions. Leveraging its pioneering monoclonal antibody technologies, Alder discovers and develops novel therapeutic antibodies designed to deliver highly differentiated, best-in-class clinical profiles.

ALD1910 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38), another protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine.

                Alder Biopharmaceuticals            








Alder BioPharmaceuticals Inc. raised nearly $162 million Tuesday to keep developing its flagship migraine drug.
Bothell-based Alder sold 15 million shares of common stock to the public at $10 per share. The company sold an additional 2.25 million shares to underwriters Leerink Partners, Wells Fargo Securities and Needham & Co. at the same price.

Proceeds from the sale were about $161.5 million after commissions and expenses, Alder said in a news release.
Alder needed the funding to prepare its flagship migraine drug, eptinezumab, for Food and Drug Administration approval and commercialize the drug. The biotech is one of the largest in the Puget Sound region, and its future depends on the success of the drug, which would be the company's first product.




ANALYSIS: Alder faces funding crunch amid migraine drug push
If Alder wins FDA approval, it will hire 75 to 125 specialized salespeople to target high-prescribing neurologists and headache centers across the U.S.
Alder's stock (Nasdaq: ALDR) has dropped about 40 percent from nearly $19 per share since it announced results of its late-stage cancer drug trial Promise 1 in late June. The stock closed at $11.55 Tuesday, down 20 cents from the opening bell.
RELATED: Alder’s flagship migraine drug trial posts strong results — and so does the placebo
Alder expects the results of another pivotal trial, Promise 2, in the first half of 2018. If the results are strong, it plans to apply to the FDA.




 


Alder's Promise 1 trial met its primary and secondary endpoints and beat competing therapies developed by Amgen Inc., Eli Lilly and Co. and Teva Pharmaceuticals in some metrics. Alder trails the three companies as they chase a market opportunity of more than $10 billion, according to a Wells Fargo Securities estimate.

Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Provides Update on Clinical Trails
Jun 30 17
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that eptinezumab met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the company's PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy (PROMISE 1) clinical trial. This Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab administered at three dose levels (300mg, 100mg and 30mg) and placebo via infusion once every 12 weeks for one year in approximately 900 patients with frequent episodic migraine. The primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days from baseline (average of 8.6 days) over weeks 1 through 12 was 4.3 monthly migraine days for 300mg (p=0.0001) and 3.9 days for 100mg (p=0.0179) compared to an average 3.2 days for placebo. The 30mg dose level was not formally tested as per the prespecified statistical analysis plan. The statistical significance of the PROMISE 1 results for each dose level across endpoints was assessed in a hierarchy in a prespecified statistical analysis plan (generally assessing the 300mg dose level for a group of endpoints, 100mg dose level for a group of endpoints and 30mg dose level for a group of endpoints in sequence). Since the result for the 100mg dose level for the 75% reduction in monthly migraine days over weeks 1 through 12 endpoint was not statistically significant, the 30mg dose level was not formally tested per the statistical analysis plan.

Description




Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies with the potential to meaningfully transform current treatment paradigms. Alder's lead pivotal-stage product candidate, eptinezumab, is being evaluated for migraine prevention. Eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine. Alder is additionally evaluating ALD1910, a preclinical product candidate also in development as a migraine prevention therapy. ALD1910 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38), another protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine. Clazakizumab, Alder's third program, is a monoclonal antibody candidate that inhibits interleukin-6 and is licensed to Vitaeris, Inc.

Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
