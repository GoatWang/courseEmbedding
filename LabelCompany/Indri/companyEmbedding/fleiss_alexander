Meet Four Guys In Their 20s Who Started A Quant Hedge Fund, Rebellion

From left: Jeremy
  Newton, Jonathan Sturges, Spencer Greenberg, and Alexander
  Fleiss


  On the cover of the 
  Wall Street Journal C-section this morning there is a rare
  (and huge) picture of 4 young guys: Spencer Greenberg, Jeremy
  Newton, Jonathan Sturges, and Alexander Fleiss.

  Who the heck are these guys?

Greenberg went to
  Columbia ('05) and Fleiss went to Amherst with Sturges and
  Newton.

They started Rebellion
  Research right after college.

  Soon after they launched, a 29-year old hedge fund guy
  anonymously snarked at 
  a profile written about the four young guys and their
  electronic investment strategy:





"Find me someone who buys
  the concept that merely going to a great school makes you a great
  investor."

At the time, their algo
  hadn't been put to use for a hedge fund yet. Now the four run $7
  million Rebellion Research with their prize algo named,
  "Star."

Here are some quick
  facts:


Started Rebellion when
    Greenberg, Fleiss and Sturges were 23. Newton was
    21.


Alexander's mother is
    Karen Fleiss, manager of KMF Partners


Sean's dad is Glenn
    Greenberg, manager of Brave Warrior Advisors


"Star" works by
    recommending a list of stocks every morning. Sometimes there
    are no stocks on the list. Then a human trader implements the
    moves (the firm never overrules Star).

Here's where some of
    the $7 million AUM comes from, according to 
    Bloomberg:  At 19, Alexander wrote
    a trading program that alerted him to apparently undervalued
    shares of a bankrupt leasing company. Using inheritance money,
    he bought up so much of the $0.37 stock that he had to file an
    ownership statement with the SEC. The shares soared to $3.70,
    and Fleiss plowed his winnings into Rebellion.

  Quotes:


"We are serious,
    experienced mathematicians" - Alexander Fleiss

"It's pretty clear that humans aren't improving. But
  computers and algorithms are only getting faster and more
  robust." - Spencer Greenberg
  

And their returns aren't
  bad either,
according to the

  Wall Street Journal
:


+17% in 2007


-26% in 2008


+41% in 2009


What now, anonymous hedge
  fund guy that dissed them back in 2006?



  Now check out what the guy these 4 should aspire to be, Paul
  Tudor Jones, is up to these days >>
