1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Life insurance is issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, Newark, NJ, Pruco Life Insurance Company (except in NY and/or NJ) and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (in NY and/or NJ).

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

With a little help, everyone can be good at life.





  











Get good guidance, so you can be good at life.


Financial Strength

                        Trust us, we’ve been doing this for over 170 years. Ask your great-great grandparents.
                    


Shared Ownership

                        We answer to you, not Wall Street. Together, we can make amazing things happen.
                    


Living Benefits

                        Call us crazy, but we think life insurance should benefit you while you’re, well, living.*

With New York Life helping manage your family’s financial future, you can live life and focus on the things that matter most to you. That’s what we call being good at life.    

Imagine a company that is owned by its policy owners** and designed to drive their collective financial strength. A company that can focus on doing the right thing because it never has to answer to Wall Street or shareholders. A company that has been around for over 170 years and only focuses on one thing: being there for its clients when they need it most and paying out dividends, even during major financial crises.*** A company that empowers its clients to make smart financial decisions that can benefit them throughout their lives.
New York Life is that company. And when you have that company by your side, you can stop worrying about financial things, and start being good at life.    
“We are more than a life insurance company. We help people achieve financial security and be good at life. It starts with helping clients make smart financial decisions today, knowing we will be there to keep our promises tomorrow.”

 Ted Mathas, CEO, New York Life

Limitations and Exclusions for residents of Arizona:
Disability caused by a Pre-existing Condition or reinjuries to a Pre-existing Condition will not be covered unless it begins more than 12 months after the Effective Date of coverage. Aflac will not pay benefits for a Disability that is being treated outside the territorial limits of the United States. Aflac will not pay benefits whenever coverage provided by the policy is in violation of any U.S. economic or trade sanctions. If the coverage violates U.S. economic or trade sanctions, such coverage shall be null and void. Aflac will not pay benefits whenever fraud is committed in making a claim under this coverage or any prior claim under any other Aflac coverage for which you received benefits that were not lawfully due and that fraudulently induced payment. Aflac will not pay benefits for a Disability that is caused by or occurs as a result of any bacterial, viral, or micro-organism infection or infestation, or any condition resulting from insect, arachnid, or other arthropod bites or stings as a Disability due to an Injury; such disability will be covered to the same extent as a Disability due to Sickness.

Pregnancy or childbirth within the first ten months of the Effective Date of coverage (Complications of Pregnancy will be covered to the same extent as a Sickness);

The policy will pay, however, for covered disabilities resulting from Alzheimer’s disease, or similar forms of senility or senile dementia, first manifested while coverage is in force.

Benefits will be paid for only one Disability at a time, even if the Disability is caused by more than one Sickness, more than one Injury, or a Sickness and an Injury.
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIMITATIONS: A “Pre-existing Condition” is an illness, disease, infection, disorder, condition or injury for which, within the 12-month period before the Effective Date of coverage, medical advice, consultation, or treatment was recommended or received, or for which symptoms existed that would ordinarily cause a prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or treatment. Disability caused by a Pre-existing Condition or reinjuries to a Pre-existing Condition, including deliveries for children conceived prior to the Effective Date of coverage, will not be covered unless it begins more than 12 months after the Effective Date of coverage.
Limitations and Exclusions for residents of Idaho: 
Disability caused by a Pre-existing Condition will not be covered unless it begins more than 12 months after the Effective Date of coverage.

Having dental treatment, except as a result of Injury;
Being exposed to war or any act of war, declared or undeclared;

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Variable annuities offer market growth potential based on the investment options you choose. A variable annuity may be a good choice if you're willing to tolerate some market risk in exchange for growth potential.
Variable annuities can offer:

Tax-deferred growth
Variable investment options
Income options, including income for life
Death benefit options
Optional benefits that may help protect your retirement assets and income (available at an additional cost)

How do variable annuities work?

You give the insurance company money in one or more payments. 
Some variable annuities let you choose from a number of variable investment options, while others offer a pre-determined mix of investments.
During the accumulation phase, your contract's value may increase – or decrease – depending on the performance of the investments you choose. Variable annuities involve risk, and it's possible to lose money.
You defer paying taxes on your contract’s interest until you receive money from the contract. Tax-deferred interest means the money in your contract can grow faster.
After a period of time specified by your contract you may then receive the amount allowed by your contract in a lump sum, over a set period of time, or as income for the rest of your life. This is known as the distribution phase.

Allianz variable annuities for New York residents

Allianz VisionSM New York Variable Annuity
Allianz Index Advantage® New York Variable Annuity











Investing in a variable annuity may be the answer for part of your overall retirement strategy. A variable annuity offers a unique combination of features, including market participation through a variety of investment options; tax-deferred growth opportunities; and optional protection benefits that can provide certain accumulation, income, and beneficiary guarantees for an additional cost. Please note that we no longer offer any variable life insurance products.
Variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to investment risk, including loss of principal, and contract/policy values fluctuate daily. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions so that units, upon distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
Purchasing an annuity within a retirement plan that provides tax deferral under sections of the Internal Revenue Code results in no additional tax benefit. An annuity should be used to fund a qualified plan based upon the annuity’s features other than tax deferral. All annuity features, risks, limitations, and costs should be considered prior to purchasing an annuity within a tax-qualified retirement plan.
Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of any protection benefits. Withdrawals taken within the contract withdrawal charge schedule will be subject to a withdrawal charge. All withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal additional tax.
For more complete information about Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York (Allianz Life® of NY) variable annuities and variable investment options, call your financial professional or Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC at 800.729.9743 for a prospectus. The prospectuses contain details on investment objectives, risks, fees, and expenses, as well as other information about the variable annuity and variable investment options, which you should carefully consider. Please read the prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

Minneapolis-based Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) provides annuities and life insurance products in the United States[1] in all states except for New York. In New York, annuities and life insurance products are offered by Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York (Allianz Life of NY).
Allianz Life offers various products, including fixed and variable annuities and life insurance. These products are offered through a network of more than 100,000 agents nationwide.
The company is a principal subsidiary of Allianz SE, a global financial services group that is the 31st largest corporation in the world based on revenue (Fortune Global 500, July 2013).[2] Allianz SE employs nearly 155,000 people worldwide.
History[edit]
Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America began as North American Casualty, started by Henry Little of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1896. North American Casualty then merged with North American Life Association – founded in 1910 by Zeke Austin with capital from Henry Little – in 1912 to become North American Life and Casualty (NALAC). H.P. Skoglund served as NALAC’s CEO for 44 years.
In 1979, NALAC was acquired by Allianz AG of Munich, Germany, becoming a company of the Allianz Group. Founded in 1890, the Allianz Group is now one of the world’s largest integrated financial services organizations with asset management, life, health and property-casualty insurance, and banking operations in more than 70 countries.
The company was renamed Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) in 1993. Today, Allianz Life and Allianz Life of NY are the only Allianz Group subsidiaries providing life insurance in the U.S.[3]
In 2010, Allianz Life was recognized by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as one of the top 100 workplaces in the Twin Cities, ranking fifth on the list of top public companies.[4] Allianz Life was also honored in 2010 as one of Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Best Places to Work winners, ranking eight on the list of large companies with more than 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees.[5]

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved. They provide guaranteed¹ income for you and your loved ones regardless of market performance. And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!Policy # EUSP2080509061

Don't bother!!!!!!!!Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!

An absolute scam.I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?

Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!

SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. Next letter is going to the BBB.Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.

Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.Do not use them!

First to Review
        


This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

        (646) 472-1400
    






One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!

Don't bother!!!!!!!!Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!

An absolute scam.I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?

SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. Next letter is going to the BBB.Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.

Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.Do not use them!

First to Review
        


This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!Policy # EUSP2080509061

Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!Policy # EUSP2080509061

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!

SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. Next letter is going to the BBB.Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.

This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.

Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.

I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!Policy # EUSP2080509061

Don't bother!!!!!!!!Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!

An absolute scam.I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!

SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. Next letter is going to the BBB.Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.

Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.Do not use them!

First to Review
        


This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!

This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

One of my children became unable to travel due to CDC guidelines. 
I file a claim, still have not heard what documentation is missing, I continue to fax it ,since can not upload it.
When i call no one knows ,what happened to my documents. Keep faxing it . My trip will be next week, Then they will tell me I am late!
Use a different company!







I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!

Policy # EUSP2080509061







Don't bother!!!!!!!!

Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!







An absolute scam.

I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.

Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.

They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.

Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.

What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?







Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.







DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!







SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. 

That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. 

Next letter is going to the BBB.

Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.







Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.
You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.
The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.
The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.
I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.
I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.

Do not use them!







Bought trip protection and they failed to honor the terms of the agreement never got a cent back not even a refund on policy!  VERY UNETHICAL STAY AWAY







This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

I bought a travel policy for my parents Cruise trip they were going to take in Dec/Jan. Unfortunately my dad had health conditions that his doctors prohibited him from going on the cruise. Upon submitting all the documentation that Allianz required we were denied our claim!! They said the health problems your father incurred aren't covered in the insurance. This company is a total scam. This is the first and the last time I will ever use them. I've been using GEO Blue for years and never had any issues. Someone told me to try Allianz and I learned my lesson. $5000 down the drain because of Allianz!Policy # EUSP2080509061

Don't bother!!!!!!!!Their system is unreliable!!!! I decided to purchase tickets to depart the same day.  My flight was cancelled.  When I called Allianz to put in a claim, my information did not show up in their system.  According to them I never purchase the insurance, however the customer must click on decline if they do not want the service, which was something I didn't do.  Apparently they are not able to track this system failure. How convenient!

An absolute scam.I had to cancel a trip to Los Angeles for job-related reasons. I submitted the claim and supporting paperwork as requested. They rejected the claim. When I clicked on the link to learn why they rejected it, the page didn't load, so I don't know. I'm stuck with a flight I'm not going on, out of $250.Their online system is shoddy and often doesn't work.They didn't communicate with me that they rejected my claim.Terrible waste of money, and shameful that Delta partners with them. It's corporate greed and legalese at its worst.What's the point of travel insurance when they reject your claim anyways?

Terrible service, very deceptive. I bought a trip protection policy on an airline's site, which claimed I would be reimbursed for damaged luggage. The actual policy was never emailed to me; however, my credit card was charged. While on vacation, I got into a bad car accident and tried to claim insurance according to my policy. And only then they finally emailed me my policy claiming the luggage had to have been damaged by the airline, which does not even make sense since airlines reimburse you if they damage your luggage and there are laws that protect you in that case. Oh well, I explained my situation and asked them for a refund of my initial expense since I never got the policy. But no luck, they claim that I should have gotten it. They cannot produce any proof that they ever sent it, I.e. Sent email, but they claim that it it is 'impossible' that I did not get it. Well, guess what Allianz, anything is possible and I did not receive your policy. A few of my friends I spoke with also indicated that very often they forget to email documents and they had to call to request them. That's a bad and unethical business practice. Never again.

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I purchased this insurance for my husband, me and my daughter- yes 3 separate policies to only be informed when I needed to use it that I would need to pay for the changes necessary and submit the charges once paid against the policy and HOPE I GET REIMBURSED. This is exactly what the customer service rep told me: Pay for it and hope we reimburse you. You are better off saving your money and praying there are no emergencies!!! And if God forbid there is an emergency, u have a better chance working directly with the airline. Please don't make the same mistake I made, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I wound up taking a day without pay from work because it was cheaper than spending $700 and HOPING to get reimbursed. Super disappointed!!!

SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not waste your money with this company as you will never see a claim paid. It is a red tape nightmare combined with delays, excuses and lack of communication. Purchased tickets for Broadway show, could not attend due to work related issue from snowstorm the night before. Followed their directions to the "T", even duplicated the sample letter they provided which needed to be submitted with claim. That'd was early February, just received letter stating they cannot honor business obligations! Called them and spoke with some alien from another country to dispute and could not get a straight a answer. Next letter is going to the BBB.Stay away from this company  and anything they offer.

Beware! you cannot reach a claims person to check on status of existing claim.You must prove via the PCP and specialist the condition for illness was not pre-existing.The physician filling out the form for reimbursement is not adequate enough to ensure reimbursement.The violate HIPPA compliance by requesting personal medical information for claims.I purchased concert tickets at madison square garden as a gift for my family during the holiday seaon. The receipient had to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure 2 days before the event, and therefore could not go to the concert.I am still trying to resolve this claim, to prove the diagnosis, date of operation and ensure it was not due to a pre-existing condition.Do not use them!

First to Review
        


This place is the WORST.  I purchased concert tickets for a show in February and purchased event insurance from them in case of an emergency and I couldnt go to the show.  As it turns out I got the flu the week before which turned into bronchitis.  I was out of work for 2 weeks.  I submitted dr's notes from both drs I saw on 2 different days, plus my discharge papers from the ER.  Thier website says it takes 10 days to process claims and get you an answer about your refund.  I sent my paperwork in at the end of February.  By mid March no answers.  They claimed to be backed up because of all of the claims from the snow storms.  Ok fine, by the 3rd week of March they were just looking at my claim and then wanted me to get a physicians statement filled out and sent to them. Seriously I just gave you 2 dr's notes and paperwork from the ER.  Now you want me to pay $25 to have my dr fill out paperwork? NO WAY!!  They calim they need to know if I had bronchitis prior to purchasing my tickets, WHAT???  The physicans statement ask my dr if I was advised not to travel.  It was a freaking concert.  Why would I discuss my plans to go to a concert with my dr?  Common sense if I am sick and missing work for 2 weeks I shouldnt be going to a concert.  I submitted yet another form from my dr on 3/21/14, I called 3/28/14, they havent even looked at the new information because they needed the physicians statement and put it back in que for another 5 days, so now they wont look at it until next Friday April 4th.  So the stuff i sent last Friday, now sits for 2 weeks? WTF? So if im lucky I will get my money back by the end of April.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

What is Burial Insurance?
Burial Insurance is a whole life insurance policy meant to cover funeral expenses. These policies typically have payouts between $5,000 - $25,000 and don't usually go higher than that. Having a burial insurance policy in place can remove a lot of the burden on your family upon your death. Funeral expenses are rising extremely fast and policies themselves can be quite affordable. If you would like to see quotes please enter your zip code above.  


How do I Buy Burial Insurance?
Unlike other types of insurance, you can buy burial insurance at any time. There are very few restrictions on what would prevent you from being able to purchase a policy and most people who apply will be approved. Before you purchase your policy, you should think about how much protection you're seeking. Insurance payouts can range greatly, so it's good to have an idea of what you need. 
Our website is dedicated to providing you quote from multiple companies in your area to make sure that you receive the best price possible. If you would like to see quotes on burial insurance, please enter your information above and we will work to find you the best possible quotes free of charge. 


Do I Need Burial Insurance?
 Having a burial insurance policy in place is a smart decision that can save your family thousands. In cases of accidental death there is a large chance that your families savings could be completely wiped out by an unexpected funeral. Funerals can lead families into debt and having a safety net will remove that burden. If you're looking to relieve the amount of stress on your family, looking for a burial insurance policy is a great way to do it. 


How Long Does a Burial Insurance Policy Last?
Burial Insurance policies are considered to be whole life insurance. This means, until the insured dies or stops paying their premium the policy will remain in effect. Certain policies have different payouts depending on how long you've been paying your premiums, with higher payouts being available for long time customers. We encourage you to ask questions for the specific policy you choose. If you would like to see quotes, you can fill out the form above and we will work to provide you with the best available plan in your area.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
