Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index (SPSIBITR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s and includes domestic companies from the biotechnology industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of the biotechnology sub-industry based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Ownership           (a)   Amount beneficially owned:             The Reporting Persons hold 15,000 shares of Series X Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series X Preferred Stock”).  The Series X Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at a per share rate of one thousand (1,000) divided by the conversion price of the Series X Preferred Stock (the “Series X Conversion Price”). The Series X Conversion Price will be equal to the lower of: (a) $2.95, the closing price for the Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ on September 6, 2016, or (b) the five-day volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Issuer’s Common Stock over the five full trading days following the earlier of (1) the date of the Issuer’s initial public announcement of topline and/or efficacy data from the ongoing Chablis-SC1 study or (2) if applicable, the date of the Issuer’s initial public announcement of the suspension (including through the imposition of a clinical hold), abandonment or other termination of the Chablis-SC1 study. Assuming a Series X Conversion Price of $2.95, the Series X Preferred Stock would be convertible into an aggregate of approximately 5,084,745 shares of Common Stock.              The Series X Preferred Stock may not be converted if, after such conversion, the Reporting Persons would beneficially own, as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), more than 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding (the “Series X Beneficial Ownership Limitation”). As of the date hereof, the Series X Preferred Stock Beneficial Ownership Limitation described in the prior sentence limits the aggregate conversion by the Reporting Persons to approximately 4,582,033 shares of Common Stock underlying the Series X Preferred Stock, owned by the Reporting Persons in the aggregate.           In providing beneficial ownership described herein, the Reporting Persons have assumed only certain Series X Preferred Stock owned by BVF and BVF2 would be fully converted, certain Series X Preferred Stock held in the Partners Managed Account would be partially converted and the remaining Series X Preferred Stock owned by Trading Fund OS would remain unconverted, thereby bringing the Reporting Persons to the aggregate Series X Beneficial Ownership Limitation.           In addition to the Series X Preferred Stock, the Reporting Persons hold approximately 1,271,185 Shares underlying certain warrants (the “Warrants”).  The Warrants will be exercised at a rate of 25% of the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series X Preferred Stock converts. Each Warrant has an exercise price equal to the Series X Conversion Price, plus a 20% premium, and will be exercisable at any time and from time to time after the date that is six months from the date of issuance, and will expire thirty months from the first date it first becomes exercisable. If the Series X Preferred Stock were convertible into 5,084,745 shares of Common Stock, the Warrants would be exercisable to purchase 1,271,185 shares of Common Stock.           The Warrants may not be exercised if, after such exercise, the Reporting Persons would beneficially own, as determined in accordance with the Exchange Act, more than 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding (the “Warrant Beneficial Ownership Limitation”).           Due to the Warrant Beneficial Ownership Limitation, in providing beneficial ownership described herein, the Reporting Persons have assumed that no Warrants would be exercised.           In addition to the Series X Preferred Stock and Warrants, the Reporting Persons hold an option to purchase an aggregate of 25,000 shares of Series X-1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series X-1 Preferred Stock” and the option to purchase the Series X-1 Preferred Stock the “Series X-1 Preferred Option”).                   The Series X-1 Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at a rate of the lesser of: (i) one thousand (1,000) divided by the product of the Series X Conversion Price and one-hundred and seventy five percent (175%) and (ii) one thousand (1,000) divided by seventy-five percent (75%) of the 5-day VWAP following the public announcement of certain top-line data.              The conversion price for the Series X-1 Preferred Stock will be equal to the lower of: (a) 75% of the five-day VWAP of the Issuer’s Common Stock over the five full trading days following the Issuer’s initial public announcement of top-line clinical efficacy and safety data from the Issuer’s ongoing “SOLUTION” clinical study or (b) 175% of the then-applicable conversion price for the Series X Preferred Stock, provided that the conversion price will in no event be lower than $2.95, the closing price for the Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ on September 6, 2016. Without the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (defined below), the 25,000 shares of Series X-1 Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 4,842,613 shares of Common Stock.           The Series X-1 Option may not be exercised if, after such exercise, the Reporting Persons would beneficially own, as determined in accordance with the Exchange Act, more than 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding (the “Series X-1 Beneficial Ownership Limitation”, together with the “Warrant Beneficial Ownership Limitation” and the “Series X Preferred Stock Beneficial Ownership Limitation” the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”).           Due to the Series X-1 Beneficial Ownership Limitation, the Reporting Persons have assumed that the Series X-1 Preferred Option would not be converted.           The Reporting Persons may choose to convert or exercise, as applicable, the Series X Preferred Stock, Series X-1 Preferred Option, Series X-1 Preferred Stock, or Warrants in other amounts among the Reporting Persons, while continuing to comply with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.           As of the date hereof, (i) BVF beneficially owned approximately 2,355,593 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of 6,949 shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by it; (ii) BVF2 beneficially owned approximately 1,539,661 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of 4,542 shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by it, and (iii) Trading Fund OS beneficially owned 0 shares of Common Stock, excluding approximately 458,305 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of 1,352 shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by it due to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. In each case, assuming a Series X Conversion Price of $2.95.           Partners OS as the general partner of Trading Fund OS may be deemed to beneficially own 0 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Trading Fund OS.           Partners, as the general partner of BVF, BVF2, the investment manager of Trading Fund OS, and the sole member of Partners OS, may be deemed to beneficially own the approximately 4,582,033 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned in the aggregate by BVF, BVF2, Trading Fund OS, and a certain Partners Managed Account (the “Partners Managed Account”), including approximately 686,779 shares of Common Stock held in the Partners Managed Account issuable upon the conversion of 2,026 shares of Series X Preferred Stock, and excluding approximately 44,407 shares of Common Stock held in the Partners Managed Account due to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. In total, the Partners Managed Account holds approximately 731,186 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of 2,157 shares of Series X Preferred Stock.              BVF Inc., as the general partner of Partners, may be deemed to beneficially own the 4,582,033 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Partners.           Mr. Lampert, as a director and officer of BVF Inc., may be deemed to beneficially own the 4,582,033 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by BVF Inc.           The foregoing should not be construed in and of itself as an admission by any Reporting Person as to beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock owned by another Reporting Person. Partners OS disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Trading Fund OS. Each of Partners, BVF Inc. and Mr. Lampert disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by BVF, BVF2, Trading Fund OS, and the Partners Managed Account, and the filing of this statement shall not be construed as an admission that any such person or entity is the beneficial owner of any such securities.           (b)   Percent of class:           The following percentages are based on a denominator that is the sum of: (a) 41,285,033 shares of Common Stock outstanding, as disclosed in the Issuer’s Prospectus Supplement on Form 424B5 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC) on September 8, 2016 and (b) 4,582,033 shares of Common Stock that may be acquired, depending on certain events, upon the conversion of certain Series X Preferred Stock held by the Reporting Persons.           As of the date hereof, (i) BVF beneficially owned approximately 5.1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (ii) BVF2 beneficially owned approximately 3.3% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iii) Trading Fund OS does not beneficially own any of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (iv) Partners OS does not beneficially own any of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (v) each of Partners, BVF Inc. and Mr. Lampert may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (approximately 1.5% of which is held in the Partners Managed Account).           (c)   Number of shares as to which such person has:           (i)   Sole power to vote or to direct the vote           See Cover Pages Items 5-9.           (ii)   Shared power to vote or to direct the vote           See Cover Pages Items 5-9.              (iii)   Sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of           See Cover Pages Items 5-9.           (iv)   Shared power to dispose or to direct the disposition of           See Cover Pages Items 5-9.

	Explanation of Responses:










	(1) 





	This Form 4 is filed jointly by Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P. ("BVF"), Biotechnology Value Fund II, L.P. ("BVF2"), Biotechnology Value Trading Fund OS LP ("Trading Fund OS"), BVF Partners OS Ltd. ("Partners OS"), BVF Partners L.P. ("Partners"), BVF Inc. and Mark N. Lampert (collectively, the "Reporting Persons"). Each of the Reporting Persons is a member of a Section 13(d) group that collectively owns more than 10% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock. Each of the Reporting Persons disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interest therein.









	(2)

	(3) 





	Securities owned directly by BVF2. As the general partner of BVF2, Partners may be deemed to beneficially own the securities owned directly by BVF2. As the investment adviser and general partner of Partners, BVF Inc. may be deemed to beneficially own the securities owned directly by BVF2.

	(4) 





	Securities owned directly by Trading Fund OS. As the general partner of Trading Fund OS, Partners OS may be deemed to beneficially own the securities owned directly by Trading Fund OS.

	(6) 





	The Issuer's Series N-3 Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") has no expiration date, and are convertible upon issuance; provided, however, that the Beneficial Ownership Conversion Limit (defined below) has not been reached by an exchanging stockholder. The Reporting Persons purchased a total of 6,750 shares of Preferred Stock. After the conversion of 6,175 Preferred Stock, the Reporting Persons reached the Beneficial Ownership Conversion Limit (defined below). Accordingly, 575 shares of Preferred Stock have not been converted to Common Stock.









	(7) 





	This Form 4 is filed in connection with the purchase by the Reporting Persons of a total of 6,750 shares of Preferred Stock, convertible for a total of approximately 4,500,000 shares of Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Preferred Stock offering, the Reporting Persons have an ongoing right to convert the Preferred Stock, accordingly, on June 9, 2017, the Reporting Persons converted an aggregate of 6,175 shares of Preferred Stock into approximately 4,116,666 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $3.00 per share of underlying Common Stock, (the "Conversion Price"); provided, however, certain of the Preferred Stock could not be converted by the Reporting Persons, because the Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own 19.99% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, calculated as provided in the certificate of designation establishing the Preferred Stock (the "Beneficial Ownership Conversion Limit").









	(8) 





	Preferred Stock (defined above), with a stated value of $2,000 per share (the "Stated Value"), are convertible into Common Stock at a ratio determined by dividing the Stated Value by the Conversion Price.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index (SPSIBITR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s and includes domestic companies from the biotechnology industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of the biotechnology sub-industry based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
