Company Overview

	Gladstone Capital’s debt investments primarily consist of three types of loans to small and medium sized businesses in the United States: senior term loans, senior subordinated loans, and junior subordinated loans.  Loans typically range from $7 million to $30 million with terms of up to seven years.  Gladstone Capital’s equity investments typically take the form of preferred or common equity (or warrants to acquire the foregoing).  Historically, as Gladstone Capital has primarily been a debt fund, it aims to maintain a portfolio consisting of approximately 90% debt investments and 10% equity investments, at cost.  In addition to its common stock, Gladstone Capital has issued a 6.75% Series 2021 Term Preferred Stock, which is also listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “GLADO.”

	Our goals are to achieve and grow current income through our debt investments that will allow distributions to stockholders to grow over time and to provide stockholders with long term appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains.

	We have three affiliate investment companies.  Gladstone Commercial Corporation is real estate investment trust that owns net leased industrial, commercial and retail property and selectively makes long-term industrial and commercial mortgage loans.  Gladstone Investment Corporation is a BDC that also invests in small and medium sized private businesses in the U.S., historically as a buyout fund.  Gladstone Land Corporation is a real estate investment trust that invests in farmland located in major agricultural markets in the U.S.

Top Buys by Top Brass: President Marcotte's $250.6K Bet on GLAD

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
