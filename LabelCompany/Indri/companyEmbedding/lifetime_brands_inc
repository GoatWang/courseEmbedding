“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

Additionally, in collaboration with our counterparts at Grupo Vasconia, we brought the popular Mexican brand Vasconia® to the U.S. consumer with a line of over 150 products, including commonly used specialty pieces all designed for preparing Latin cuisine. 
Similarly, we have also formed a strategic alliance with Accent-Fairchild Group, Inc. in Canada to expand the presence of our brands and products in the Canadian market. Having been Lifetime’s distributor in Canada for over 15 years, Accent-Fairchild has strong relationships with Canada’s leading retailers and is the logical partner to help us increase our penetration in the Canadian market.

In 2011, Lifetime, Accent-Fairchild, Grupo Vasconia and Fackelmann GmbH Co. KG form Housewares Corporation of Asia Limited to design and manufacture kitchenware products in Asia for sale to customers in North and South America.

Later that year, Lifetime acquired Creative Tops Limited and Creative Tops Far East. Together with Lifetime's established partnerships in North and Central America, this strategic combination creates a global leader in the housewares business with a focus on quality and innovation. 

Lifetime also acquired a 40% equity interest in GS Internacional S/A (“GSI”), a leading wholesale distributor of branded housewares products in Brazil that dinnerware, glassware, home décor, kitchenware and barware to over 7,000 customers, including major department stores, housewares retailers and independent shops throughout Brazil.

By partnering with Lifetime and thereby gaining access to our brands, product development capability and global sourcing infrastructure, GSI will have the opportunity to become the leading supplier of high quality, innovative housewares products to retailers in Brazil and other parts of South America. 


The 2014 acquisition of Thomas Plant Limited, trading as Kitchen Craft, makes Lifetime a more effective global resource to our key retailer partners. Kitchen Craft’s broad ranges of kitchenware products fill a gap in our existing UK housewares assortment that will complement the tableware and gift assortments marketed by Creative Tops. 

Later that year, Lifetime acquired the business and certain assets of La Cafetière from The Greenfield Group Limited including exclusive distribution rights. The addition of the La Cafetière® and Randwyck® brands to Lifetime’s global platform further strengthens our presence in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.

Community
Lifetime Brands is a proud supporter of Susan G. Komen for the Cure® through participation in the KitchenAid Cook for the Cure® program. To date, Lifetime Brands has donated $1,000,000 to Susan G. Komen for the Cure, since joining the program in 2005.

Lifetime Brands has also donated over $1,000,000 to the Housewares Charity Foundation which is a major supporter of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and other charities such as the Haiti Relief Fund, America’s Second Harvest, University of Chicago Integrated Breast Cancer Research Laboratory, and the Aplastic Anemia & MDS International Foundation. 


Sustainability
At Lifetime Brands, we believe that intelligent business and environmental responsibility go hand in hand. Our goal is to implement sustainable practices in all facets of our operations and through the actions of our associates. In addition, we educate all employees on sustainable activities they can do at work and at home. 


Summer Internship Program
The Lifetime Brands Summer Internship Program gives students hands-on experience at North
America’s leading resource for nationally branded kitchenware, tabletop and home décor
products.  Students are put in a challenging environment and are given an in-depth understanding 
of marketing, product development and design.

We look for students interested in marketing, product development and merchandising.  They learn the marketing and product development process, working with our product managers, packaging and design group, our team in Asia and our sales force.  Each intern is assigned to a mentor, who ensures that he or she learns about all the business areas to which he is assigned.  No intern will simply push paper or make copies –– he will learn about his category.  From research to store visits to packaging, our interns get first-hand experience and learn the key functions that it takes to bring a product to market. 

Our intern program provides the company with outstanding local talent, and we’ve had great success in transitioning our interns into full-time positions upon graduation.  Several of our former interns have grown into successful senior level positions within the company.

          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.

      Lifetime Brands, Inc., formerly Lifetime Hoan Corporation, designs,
      develops, markets, and distributes a wide range of household consumer
      products under both owned and licensed brands. These products include
      cutlery, kitchenware, cutting boards, bakeware, cookware, pantryware,
      tabletop products, and bath accessories. Among the trademarks the company
      owns are Hoffritz, Roshco, Baker's Advantage, Kamenstein, CasaModa,
      Hoan, Gemco, and USE; licensed brands include Farberware, KitchenAid,
      Cuisinart, Sabatier, DBK-Daniel Boulud Kitchen, and Joseph Abboud
      Environments. Each year, Lifetime's 35-person design department
      creates in excess of 600 new products, ranging from entry-level items
      through the mid-priced sector and to the upscale. The company farms out
      production to about 100 contract manufacturers located primarily in the
      People's Republic of China, where it maintains two
      showroom/offices. Lifetime sells its products primarily in the United
      States to about 900 customers, which include national retailers,
      department store chains, mass merchant retail and discount stores,
      supermarket chains, warehouse clubs, specialty stores, off-price
      retailers, and home centers—more than 33,000 individual retail
      locations in all. Its largest customer is the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. chain,
      which accounts for about 24 percent of net sales. Through its Outlet
      Retail Stores, Inc. subsidiary, Lifetime Brands also owns and operates
      about 60 Farberware outlet stores located in 31 states. Most of
      Lifetime's products are shipped to its customers from the
      firm's 550,000-square-foot distribution center in Robbinsville, New
      Jersey.
    

      Cutlery Beginnings
    

      The founder of Lifetime Brands—and the chairman, CEO, and president
      of the company to the advent of the 21st century—was Milton Cohen,
      born in 1929, the son of a garment worker. Following high school, Cohen
      began working as a scissors and shears salesman. He eventually gained a
      position, at age 26, managing sales on the East Coast for a large cutlery
      firm.
    

      Wanting to be his own boss, Cohen joined in 1957 with partner Sam Siegel
      to start a knife factory in Brooklyn under the name Reo Products. In 1960
      Reo Products acquired 1945-founded Lifetime Cutlery Corporation, a larger
      distributor of knives than Reo. Cohen adopted Lifetime's name for
      his company.
    

      Cohen, in a 1995 interview with the 
      
        New York Times
      
      , estimated that there were about 100 cutlery manufacturers in the United
      States in the late 1950s, but that their numbers dwindled over the decades
      to three. Most of the companies failed because of increasing imports of
      cheap goods from Asia. A key to his company's survival, Cohen had
      concluded, was the 1961 decision to shift manufacturing overseas. That
      year the company began contracting with manufacturers in Japan for the
      production of parts. The parts were then shipped to the Brooklyn factory
      for assembly and packing. Freed from the production of basic parts, Cohen
      and Siegel could concentrate on design, packaging, and marketing. Over the
      years, Lifetime Cutlery shifted its production from one east Asian country
      to the next, progressing to Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia,
      Indonesia, Thailand, and China.
    

      Between 1965 and 1967 Lifetime sold 50 million steak knives to Shell Oil
      for ten cents each. Shell gave one of the ivory-plastic-handled knives out
      to each customer coming in
       for a fill-up. Cohen told 
      
        Business Week
      
       in 1994, "It was a lot of business and just a lot of hard work and
      no profit."
    

      By staying away from such risky gimmicks and especially through relentless
      marketing, Cohen, Siegel, and a third partner increased sales by 1980 to
      $13 million. Within a year, however, both of Cohen's partners died.
      Needing cash for himself and to provide for his partners' families,
      Cohen—in collaboration with his former partners' sons,
      Jeffrey Siegel and Craig Phillips—executed a $16 million leveraged
      buyout (LBO) of the company in April 1984. Siegel and Phillips became
      executives at Lifetime, remaining in executive positions and on the board
      of directors into the early 2000s.
    

      Acquisition of Hoan Products: Mid-1980s
    

      Cohen and his new partners acquired a controlling interest in Hoan
      Products Ltd. in 1986; they soon owned the company outright, through a
      total investment of $4 million. Hoan Products was an unprofitable supplier
      of kitchen tools and gadgets generating annual sales of $14 million (whose
      name stood for "Housewares of All Nations"). Lifetime
      Cutlery became Lifetime Hoan Corporation following the takeover.
    

      Still headquartered in low-cost Brooklyn, Lifetime Hoan moved the Hoan
      operation there, selling its New Jersey headquarters for $5 million. Other
      changes included redesigning the Hoan line, cutting the costs of
      manufacturing Hoan products, and selling them through Lifetime's
      established channels. The last of these maneuvers was particularly
      strategic as both Lifetime cutlery and Hoan kitchenware were positioned in
      the entrylevel and middle-market sectors, selling well in supermarkets,
      mass merchandise stores, and specialty shops. By the early 1990s half of
      the company's sales came from the Hoan line.
    

      In 1987 Lifetime Hoan moved its manufacturing operation to Dayton, New
      Jersey, maintaining its headquarters in Brooklyn. That same year the
      company entered into its first licensing agreement. In a deal with The
      Walt Disney Company, Lifetime obtained the right to develop and market a
      line of Disney flatware and a line of kitchen gadgets under the Chef
      Mickey name. After some ups and downs, the two companies settled on
      profitable lines of children's housewares featuring Mickey and
      Minnie Mouse on such items as bag clips, party goods, bottle stoppers, and
      flatware.
    

      Farberware and Pillsbury Licenses Marking Early 1990s
    

      Revenues reached $38.5 million by 1989, while net income stood at
      $800,000. At this time Lifetime Hoan's cutlery lines, which
      included the Tristar and Old Homestead brands, remained on the lower end
      of the market. The company made its first move up the scale in early 1990
      when it entered into a license agreement with Farberware, Inc. to market
      cutlery, kitchen gadgets, and barbecue accessories under the well-known
      and respected Farberware name. Founded in 1900, Farberware made its
      reputation with the stainless steel cookware it introduced soon after the
      end of World War II and the beginnings of the postwar boom years. In 1966
      Farberware was acquired by Walter Kidde & Co., which sold the
      company to British conglomerate Hanson PLC in 1987. Under Hanson,
      Farberware began broadening the range of products bearing the famous
      brand, with the agreement with Lifetime Hoan a notable part of that trend.
      The Lifetime-created Farberware products were mid-priced and aimed at
      department stores and specialty shops, a retail sector already well
      acquainted with the Farberware name. This strategy enhanced both the
      probability that stores would stock the items and that consumers would buy
      them.
    

      A similar licensing deal involving the leveraging of a familiar brand was
      reached in April 1991, this time with the Pillsbury Company for a line of
      moderately priced bakeware and kitchen accessories. Launched in mid-1992,
      the line eventually included items such as nonstick cookie sheets and pie
      pans, spatulas, whisks, and cookie cutters featuring the Pillsbury
      Doughboy logo, as well as accessories such as peelers, can openers,
      kitchen hooks, and steamers incorporating the Green Giant character. These
      products were aimed at the supermarket channel, where the Pillsbury brands
      were long established.
    

      In June 1991 Lifetime Hoan sold 40 percent of the company to the public in
      an initial public offering (IPO) that raised $19.4 million. Portions of
      the proceeds were used to virtually eliminate Lifetime's
      outstanding debt (some stemming from the 1984 LBO) and to redeem all
      outstanding preferred stock, leaving about $7.7 million in working
      capital. The offering not only strengthened the company's balance
      sheet, it also positioned Lifetime to grow through continued aggressive
      new product development and through acquisition. In addition, the offering
      provided some liquidity for Cohen and the second-generation Siegel and
      Phillips shareholders, a lesson Cohen learned from the surprise deaths of
      his original partners. As of 1993, Cohen and his family held a 24 percent
      stake in Lifetime Hoan, while the Siegel and Phillips families held
      another 27 percent.
    

      The company launched a new brand, Smart Choice, in 1993. This was a line
      of gadgets, packaged as impulse purchases and geared strictly for
      supermarkets, drugstore chains, and mass merchandisers. Smart Choice
      helped fuel a new product blitz whereby Lifetime introduced 500 new items
      in 1994, compared with 150 the previous year. By 1994 the company offered
      about 3,000 different products.
    


        Company Perspectives:
      


          Lifetime Brands, Inc. continues to grow by utilizing advanced design
          capabilities to emphasize innovation and quality within its portfolio
          of premium brands. Lifetime Hoan's in-house design and product
          development team, composed of 27 professionals, uses advanced training
          in state-of-the-art design programs to incorporate new materials and
          technology into our product assortments.
        



      Sales reached $77.4 million in 1994, nearly double the figure of 1989.
      Profits stood at $8.6 million, which translated into a profit margin of
      11.1 percent, quite impressive for a maker of mainly low-priced
      housewares. The Farberware license was responsible for much of the
      increase in both sales and profits, as the Farberware line accounted for
      more than a quarter of overall sales and an even larger portion of
      profits. The decision to sell more higher priced products (a Farberware
      set of knives might be priced three times higher than a similar set under
      one of
       Lifetime's other brands) was clearly beginning to pay dividends.
      The company's shareholders benefited thereby from a 3- for-2 stock
      split in late 1993.
    

      Lifetime Hoan moved its headquarters to Westbury, New York (on Long
      Island), in October 1994. The company had outgrown its space in Brooklyn,
      but also found difficulty in attracting employees there. Of particular
      importance was hiring new computer-literate designers because the design
      department was being expanded and computerized during this period. The
      move to Long Island enabled Lifetime to bring in the highly skilled people
      it needed and to improve its productivity. The company paid $5 million for
      a 40,000-square-foot building, used as headquarters and for a showroom for
      visiting buyers. Previously, because many buyers were reluctant to venture
      into Brooklyn, Lifetime had had to maintain a showroom in expensive
      Manhattan, where high rents limited its size. At this new building, the
      company had a huge showroom, where buyers could tour both it and
      Lifetime's high-tech design shop at the same time. Meantime,
      Lifetime continued to contract out its manufacturing to its Asian
      partners, with final assembly and packaging handled at its New Jersey
      factory.
    

      Mid- to Late 1990s Hoffritz, Farberware, and Roshco Deals
    

      The mid- to late 1990s saw an ever more aggressive Lifetime Hoan complete
      a series of acquisitions and enter into new licensing and partnership
      deals. Having established itself as a leader in the entry-level and
      mid-priced segments of the housewares market, Hoan sought to enter the
      high-end market. To do so, it decided to acquire an instantly recognizable
      brand, rather than license one. After a two-year search, Lifetime settled
      upon the upscale 60-year-old Hoffritz brand, acquiring it in September
      1995 from Alco Capital Group, Inc., an investment firm that had purchased
      Hoffritz in late 1992 from the bankrupt C.W. Acquisitions. At one time,
      there had been 197 Hoffritz stores selling upscale cutlery and
      kitchenware, but by the time Lifetime acquired the brand there were only
      six (and these were closed shortly thereafter).
    

      Lifetime launched a new line of Hoffritz products in the spring of 1996, a
      line that within a few years exceeded 300 items. It featured knives,
      scissors, and shears; kitchenware, including spatulas, ladles, peelers,
      ice cream scoops, lemon zesters, serving spoons, graters, thermometers,
      and colanders; barbecue accessories; cutting boards; pepper grinders; bar
      accessories; and personal care implements, such as nail files and
      clippers, tweezers, manicure sets, and pocket knives. Lifetime marketed
      Hoffritz products in department and specialty stores through a
      "shop within a store" concept.
    

      In 1995 Hanson spun off Farberware and 33 of its other smaller U.S.
      subsidiaries, forming U.S. Industries Inc. The new company soon began
      shopping Farberware around, having designated it a noncore asset. In April
      1996 Lifetime Hoan joined with Syratech Corporation, an East Boston-based
      maker of tabletop and giftware products, to acquire most of the assets of
      Farberware for a total of about $52 million, $12.7 million of which was
      paid by Lifetime in cash. Syratech gained Farberware's cookware and
      small electrical appliances business. Lifetime and Syratech simultaneously
      entered into a 50–50 joint venture that gained outright ownership
      of the rights to the Farberware trademarks. Through this joint venture,
      Lifetime acquired a 200-year, royalty-free, exclusive right to the
      Farberware name in connection with the cutlery, kitchen gadgets, and
      barbecue accessories covered by the 1990 licensing agreement; in essence
      Lifetime thereby owned the trademark for these product categories. The
      company also acquired 50 Farberware outlet stores. In July 1997 Lifetime
      struck a deal with Meyer Corporation, the licensed manufacturer of
      Farberware cookware, in connection with these stores. Lifetime would
      continue to own and operate the stores, while Meyer and Lifetime would be
      jointly responsible for merchandising and stocking them, with Meyer
      handling the cookware and Lifetime the rest of the stock. Meyer would
      receive all revenue from sale of the cookware and reimburse Lifetime for
      62.5 percent of the stores' operating expenses. Through this
      arrangement, the stores returned to profitability. In the meantime, in
      October 1997, Lifetime Hoan announced that it had initiated payment of
      cash dividends on its stock, starting with the third quarter of 1997, a
      move reflecting a company confident of its long-term prospects.

          Company changes its name to Lifetime Brands, Inc.
        



      Not resting on its laurels, Lifetime in August 1998 acquired Roshco, Inc.,
      a Chicago-based, privately held distributor of better-quality bakeware
      under the Roshco and Baker's Advantage brands. The addition of
      Roshco, which had revenues of $10 million in 1997, not only extended the
      company further into the bakeware sector, it also added to the already
      strong array of higher-end products Lifetime could aim at department and
      specialty stores. In late 1998 Lifetime achieved similar aims through the
      signing of a license agreement with Corning Consumer Products Company for
      the design and marketing of cutlery and cutting boards under the
      well-known Revere brand. The first products from this line were introduced
      in early 1999.
    

      Over the course of the 1990s Lifetime Hoan made a dramatic transition from
      a marketer of lower-end, lesser-known trademarks to that of higher-end,
      better-known brands. Farberware and Hoffritz quickly became
      Lifetime's most important brands, with these lines accounting for
      about 60 percent of overall sales in 1996, 70 percent in 1997, 75 percent
      in 1998, and 80 percent in 1999. The addition of the Roshco and Revere
      brands to the company stable were logical extensions of the same strategy.
      At the very end of the decade, in December 1999, Jeffrey Siegel was named
      president of Lifetime Hoan, having served as executive vice-president
      since 1967. Cohen remained chairman and CEO.
    

      Aggressive Expansion in the Early 2000s
    

      Lifetime stepped up its pace of expansion in the early 2000s. In September
      2000 the company acquired privately held M. Kamenstein, Inc. Founded in
      Brooklyn, New York, by Meyer Kamenstein in 1893, M. Kamenstein produced
      pantryware, teakettles, and home organization accessories crafted of wood,
      glass, plastic, metal, and combinations thereof. A month later, Lifetime
      entered into a licensing agreement with Whirlpool Corporation to design,
      manufacture, and market a line of high-end kitchen utensils under the
      well-regarded KitchenAid brand. Lifetime's KitchenAid line became
      the company's top brand within just a couple of years. More than
      470 KitchenAid items were introduced in 2001, the debut year, in what
      management called "the most successful introduction in the
      company's history." The agreement with Whirlpool was soon
      expanded to include bakeware, which hit store shelves in the second half
      of 2002. Also in 2000, after achieving only minimal sales from the Revere
      products, Lifetime terminated its agreement with Corning Consumer Products
      for the licensed Revere line. Finally, in December 2000 Siegel assumed the
      additional title of CEO. He was named chairman as well six months later,
      taking over for the retiring Cohen.
    

      Following up on the success of the KitchenAid line, Lifetime secured the
      rights to produce cutlery under another prestigious brand, Cuisinart. This
      deal, completed in March 2002 with Conair Corporation, led to the
      introduction late that year of three lines of deluxe fine-edge Cuisinart
      brand cutlery. Also in late 2002 Lifetime created a new division called
      CasaModa, whose lines would feature moderately priced barware and
      serveware.
    

      As the company was implementing this aggressive expansion, which along
      with organic growth in existing brands translated into fairly steady
      increases in revenues each year of about 10 percent, a major overhaul of
      Lifetime's warehouse management system was negatively affecting the
      bottom line. The systems and software were overhauled in order that the
      company could shift its warehousing from three separate facilities to a
      much larger, single, state-of-the-art warehouse in Robbinsville, New
      Jersey. This new facility, boasting 550,000 square feet, was finally
      operational in January 2003, by which time Lifetime had suffered through
      four straight years of depressed earnings ranging from $2.3 million to $4
      million. The millions spent on the new warehouse and its critical systems
      paid off as net income reached $8.4 million in 2003 on record revenues of
      $160.4 million. Nevertheless, the resulting net profit margin of 5.2
      percent, while a large improvement over the immediately preceding years,
      was a far cry from the 10 to 11 percent figures of the period from 1996 to
      1998.
    

      Lifetime Hoan's expansion continued apace in 2003 and 2004. The
      highly successful KitchenAid line was further broadened with the
      introductions of ceramic bakeware and serveware as well as premium
      barbecue tools. Late in the year the company reached an agreement with
      Whirlpool to expand the line again, to create premium kitchen cutlery,
      knife storage blocks, knife sharpeners, and wood cutting boards. These
      KitchenAid products debuted in 2004. One of Lifetime's most
      successful product introductions of 2003 was the S'mores Maker, a
      tabletop gadget for making the familiar campfire dessert made from graham
      crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows. Several different models were
      offered, sold under three company brands—CasaModa, Hoffritz, and
      Roshco. In February 2004 Lifetime entered into an agreement with Hershey
      Foods Corporation to begin producing and marketing S'mores Makers
      and chocolate fondue sets under the Hershey brand name. Another innovative
      tabletop item was the CasaModa Smokeless Tabletop Griller, which debuted
      in 2004.
    

      Three more acquisitions broadened Lifetime's growing array of
      products still further. In October 2003 the company acquired the USE
      brand, which had been created in 1995 by noted industrial designer Robert
      Sonneman. This addition extended Lifetime's reach into the
      bathroom. USE products included decorative hardware, mirrors, lighting,
      and window decorations for the bath. One month later, Lifetime bought the
      assets of the bankrupt Gemco Ware, Inc., based in Hauppauge, New York.
      Gemco, whose history dated back to the late 1940s, produced a popular line
      of glassware that included salt and pepper shakers, sugar dispensers, and
      oil and vinegar cruets. In July 2004 Lifetime Hoan paid about $8.5 million
      for Excel Importing Corp., based in Westbury, New York. Lifetime thereby
      gained the license rights to several high-end brands, including Sabatier,
      DBK-Daniel Boulud Kitchen, and Joseph Abboud Environments, as well as
      extending its use of the Farberware brand into dinnerware and glassware.
      The Excel deal was particularly important because it expanded both
      Lifetime's product line, into flatware, dinnerware, and glassware,
      and its customer base, to include such high-end retailers as
      Williams-Sonoma, Crate and Barrel, and Neiman-Marcus.
    

      The diversification drive inspired the company to change its name to
      Lifetime Brands, Inc. as a reflection of its expanding array of household
      products. The change took effect in June 2005. Further complementary
      acquisitions were anticipated as well as the introduction of hundreds of
      new products as Lifetime's annual revenues were expected to
      approach a quarter of a billion dollars.

Overview[edit]




Lifetime Elite Basketball System


Lifetime Products uses polyethylene blow molding and metal forming technology to create a variety of consumer and industrial products. Lifetime has the largest single-point blow molded plastics facility in North America, occupying 2,200,000 square feet (200,000 m2), and employs over 2200 people worldwide.[3] Lifetime Products produces the only folding chair to comply with the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA), which defines durability standards testing of commercial-grade chairs.[4] Lifetime also complies with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),[5] and their basketball systems are evaluated by the American Society for Testing and Materials.[6] Lifetime is headquartered in the Freeport Center in Clearfield, Utah, United States. Vertically integrated manufacturing facilities reside in Clearfield, Xiamen, China, and Mascot, Tennessee. US distribution facilities are located in North Kansas City, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio. International distribution facilities are in Monterrey, Mexico and Lille, France.[2]
Lifetime products are available in more than 80 countries. In the United States, Lifetime basketball systems are in sporting goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports and Outdoors, MC Sports, and Modell’s, as well as retailers such as Wal-Mart, warehouse clubs such as Sam's Club, Costco, BJ’s, and in regional stores. Lifetime tables and chairs and lawn and garden products are available in-store at Sam's Club, Costco, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and Lowe's. Most Lifetime products can also be found in the Lifetime Store online.[7]
History[edit]
In 1972, Lifetime Product’s founder, Barry Mower, set out to make a sturdier basketball pole for his backyard. He purchased a small length of heavy-duty used pipe, a piece of plywood, and a basketball rim, and built his own basketball standard. Seeing the potential in what he had constructed, he placed an ad in the local classifieds and made his first sale.
His backyard business eventually became a modest sporting goods store, and in March 1986, became Lifetime Products, a name inspired by the goal of building durable and lasting products. Shortly after, the research and design staff created and patented the "Quick Adjust" basketball system, the first easy to adjust residential basketball system that used a broom stick handle to raise and lower the rim from 7.5 to 10 feet. The concept of adjustable basketball systems transformed the market, making non-adjustable systems obsolete in mass-merchant chains.
Lifetime Products was the first company to provide a complete basketball system in one package[citation needed], allowing retailers to conveniently stock, display and sell basketball equipment. The complete package concept now dominates the market.[2] After expanding quickly in the first year, Lifetime began to focus on producing more durable basketball rims, and consequently developed a hoop that withstood twice the load of the nearest competitor’s rim[citation needed].
In the first three years, the company grew to 167 employees and occupied 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) of manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. New equipment, including an electrostatic powder coating operation and a robotic rim welding system, was installed to keep up with demand. A metal fabrication department was also formed to constantly update and improve presses and dies.
Utilizing its expertise in plastics and metals, Lifetime then invented the first blow-molded folding picnic table in 1995, the first blow-molded folding banquet table in 1998, and a steel reinforced blow molded outdoor storage building in 2005. They continue to develop portable basketball systems, height adjustments, tables, chairs, outdoor storage sheds, and lawn and garden equipment, such as wheelbarrows, carts, and revolving compost bins.
In May 2010, Lifetime acquired the assets of Dragonfly Innovation Corp., a producer of blow-molded kayaks, and kayak production was moved to Lifetime's facilities in Utah. Lifetime kayaks are popular among beginners and casual users, and are designed to prevent flipping.[8] In November 2011, Lifetime acquired Pennsylvania-based Emotion Kayaks, making Lifetime one of the largest kayak manufacturers in the world.[9]
Lifetime Products is still led by its original founder.

Overview[edit]




Lifetime Elite Basketball System


Lifetime Products uses polyethylene blow molding and metal forming technology to create a variety of consumer and industrial products. Lifetime has the largest single-point blow molded plastics facility in North America, occupying 2,200,000 square feet (200,000 m2), and employs over 2200 people worldwide.[3] Lifetime Products produces the only folding chair to comply with the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA), which defines durability standards testing of commercial-grade chairs.[4] Lifetime also complies with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),[5] and their basketball systems are evaluated by the American Society for Testing and Materials.[6] Lifetime is headquartered in the Freeport Center in Clearfield, Utah, United States. Vertically integrated manufacturing facilities reside in Clearfield, Xiamen, China, and Mascot, Tennessee. US distribution facilities are located in North Kansas City, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio. International distribution facilities are in Monterrey, Mexico and Lille, France.[2]
Lifetime products are available in more than 80 countries. In the United States, Lifetime basketball systems are in sporting goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports and Outdoors, MC Sports, and Modell’s, as well as retailers such as Wal-Mart, warehouse clubs such as Sam's Club, Costco, BJ’s, and in regional stores. Lifetime tables and chairs and lawn and garden products are available in-store at Sam's Club, Costco, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and Lowe's. Most Lifetime products can also be found in the Lifetime Store online.[7]
History[edit]
In 1972, Lifetime Product’s founder, Barry Mower, set out to make a sturdier basketball pole for his backyard. He purchased a small length of heavy-duty used pipe, a piece of plywood, and a basketball rim, and built his own basketball standard. Seeing the potential in what he had constructed, he placed an ad in the local classifieds and made his first sale.
His backyard business eventually became a modest sporting goods store, and in March 1986, became Lifetime Products, a name inspired by the goal of building durable and lasting products. Shortly after, the research and design staff created and patented the "Quick Adjust" basketball system, the first easy to adjust residential basketball system that used a broom stick handle to raise and lower the rim from 7.5 to 10 feet. The concept of adjustable basketball systems transformed the market, making non-adjustable systems obsolete in mass-merchant chains.
Lifetime Products was the first company to provide a complete basketball system in one package[citation needed], allowing retailers to conveniently stock, display and sell basketball equipment. The complete package concept now dominates the market.[2] After expanding quickly in the first year, Lifetime began to focus on producing more durable basketball rims, and consequently developed a hoop that withstood twice the load of the nearest competitor’s rim[citation needed].
In the first three years, the company grew to 167 employees and occupied 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) of manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. New equipment, including an electrostatic powder coating operation and a robotic rim welding system, was installed to keep up with demand. A metal fabrication department was also formed to constantly update and improve presses and dies.
Utilizing its expertise in plastics and metals, Lifetime then invented the first blow-molded folding picnic table in 1995, the first blow-molded folding banquet table in 1998, and a steel reinforced blow molded outdoor storage building in 2005. They continue to develop portable basketball systems, height adjustments, tables, chairs, outdoor storage sheds, and lawn and garden equipment, such as wheelbarrows, carts, and revolving compost bins.
In May 2010, Lifetime acquired the assets of Dragonfly Innovation Corp., a producer of blow-molded kayaks, and kayak production was moved to Lifetime's facilities in Utah. Lifetime kayaks are popular among beginners and casual users, and are designed to prevent flipping.[8] In November 2011, Lifetime acquired Pennsylvania-based Emotion Kayaks, making Lifetime one of the largest kayak manufacturers in the world.[9]
Lifetime Products is still led by its original founder.

In the first three years, the company grew to 167 employees and occupied 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) of manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. New equipment, including an electrostatic powder coating operation and a robotic rim welding system, was installed to keep up with demand. A metal fabrication department was also formed to constantly update and improve presses and dies.
Utilizing its expertise in plastics and metals, Lifetime then invented the first blow-molded folding picnic table in 1995, the first blow-molded folding banquet table in 1998, and a steel reinforced blow molded outdoor storage building in 2005. They continue to develop portable basketball systems, height adjustments, tables, chairs, outdoor storage sheds, and lawn and garden equipment, such as wheelbarrows, carts, and revolving compost bins.
In May 2010, Lifetime acquired the assets of Dragonfly Innovation Corp., a producer of blow-molded kayaks, and kayak production was moved to Lifetime's facilities in Utah. Lifetime kayaks are popular among beginners and casual users, and are designed to prevent flipping.[8] In November 2011, Lifetime acquired Pennsylvania-based Emotion Kayaks, making Lifetime one of the largest kayak manufacturers in the world.[9]
Lifetime Products is still led by its original founder.

Overview[edit]




Lifetime Elite Basketball System


Lifetime Products uses polyethylene blow molding and metal forming technology to create a variety of consumer and industrial products. Lifetime has the largest single-point blow molded plastics facility in North America, occupying 2,200,000 square feet (200,000 m2), and employs over 2200 people worldwide.[3] Lifetime Products produces the only folding chair to comply with the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA), which defines durability standards testing of commercial-grade chairs.[4] Lifetime also complies with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),[5] and their basketball systems are evaluated by the American Society for Testing and Materials.[6] Lifetime is headquartered in the Freeport Center in Clearfield, Utah, United States. Vertically integrated manufacturing facilities reside in Clearfield, Xiamen, China, and Mascot, Tennessee. US distribution facilities are located in North Kansas City, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio. International distribution facilities are in Monterrey, Mexico and Lille, France.[2]
Lifetime products are available in more than 80 countries. In the United States, Lifetime basketball systems are in sporting goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports and Outdoors, MC Sports, and Modell’s, as well as retailers such as Wal-Mart, warehouse clubs such as Sam's Club, Costco, BJ’s, and in regional stores. Lifetime tables and chairs and lawn and garden products are available in-store at Sam's Club, Costco, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and Lowe's. Most Lifetime products can also be found in the Lifetime Store online.[7]
History[edit]
In 1972, Lifetime Product’s founder, Barry Mower, set out to make a sturdier basketball pole for his backyard. He purchased a small length of heavy-duty used pipe, a piece of plywood, and a basketball rim, and built his own basketball standard. Seeing the potential in what he had constructed, he placed an ad in the local classifieds and made his first sale.
His backyard business eventually became a modest sporting goods store, and in March 1986, became Lifetime Products, a name inspired by the goal of building durable and lasting products. Shortly after, the research and design staff created and patented the "Quick Adjust" basketball system, the first easy to adjust residential basketball system that used a broom stick handle to raise and lower the rim from 7.5 to 10 feet. The concept of adjustable basketball systems transformed the market, making non-adjustable systems obsolete in mass-merchant chains.
Lifetime Products was the first company to provide a complete basketball system in one package[citation needed], allowing retailers to conveniently stock, display and sell basketball equipment. The complete package concept now dominates the market.[2] After expanding quickly in the first year, Lifetime began to focus on producing more durable basketball rims, and consequently developed a hoop that withstood twice the load of the nearest competitor’s rim[citation needed].
In the first three years, the company grew to 167 employees and occupied 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) of manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. New equipment, including an electrostatic powder coating operation and a robotic rim welding system, was installed to keep up with demand. A metal fabrication department was also formed to constantly update and improve presses and dies.
Utilizing its expertise in plastics and metals, Lifetime then invented the first blow-molded folding picnic table in 1995, the first blow-molded folding banquet table in 1998, and a steel reinforced blow molded outdoor storage building in 2005. They continue to develop portable basketball systems, height adjustments, tables, chairs, outdoor storage sheds, and lawn and garden equipment, such as wheelbarrows, carts, and revolving compost bins.

                                            The BUILT NY IceTec™ Wine & Champagne Bag uses patent-pending IceTec™ technology to help keep drinks cold for hours.  The reusable bag features a food safe freezable gel sandwiched between an insulting outside layer and cold-transmitting inside layer.  the Built IceTec™ bag has a secure zipper closure, folds flat for compact storage, and has a stitch-free interior, which makes it easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth.  To use, simply fold the bag flat, place it in the freezer overnight to activate the built-in freezable gel, and it will be ready to use in the morning. The bags was tested for lead safety and phthalates, and are PVC and BPA-free.

Lifetime Brands, Inc. Acquires Copco® Thermal and Hydration Beverageware, Tea Kettles and Kitchen Organization Products
Broad, Trend-Right Product Assortment Enhances Lifetime’s Array of Offerings



















October 06, 2016 08:00 ET

 | Source: Lifetime Brands, Inc.






GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Oct.  06, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lifetime Brands, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LCUT), a leading global provider of branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home, today announced it has acquired the Copco® product line from Wilton Brands LLC. Founded in 1960, Copco sells a wide variety of thermal and hydration beverageware, tea kettles and kitchen organization products.  Jeffrey Siegel, Lifetime’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Copco has a rich history as a leader of high-end design and innovation in the important thermal and hydration beverageware category, which includes travel mugs, cups, tumblers and carafes, and in the kitchen. Its trend-forward designs in thermal and hydration beverageware, which reflect today’s on-the-go lifestyles and changing consumer trends towards fashion, reusability, durability and flexibility, have enabled it to achieve double-digit growth in this category. Copco® branded tea kettles, representing the broadest assortment in the industry, have long been a staple in American households for both decorative and functional purposes. Copco also offers a wide array of kitchen organizers, building on its 50+ years of design and innovation experience to consistently bring fresh, creative products to retailers.” Mr. Siegel continued, “Like the three kitchen brands we recently acquired from Focus Products Group, the Copco® brand fits perfectly into Lifetime’s platform and we have the resources to quickly enhance its performance.  Moreover, since Copco® branded products are in categories in which Lifetime already is well-established, we expect the acquisition to provide immediate gross margin dollars without any accompanying increase in SG&A.” The acquisition is expected to be accretive to the Company’s diluted earnings per share in 2016.  Terms of the acquisition were not announced.  Forward-Looking Statements In this press release, the use of the words “believe,” "could," "expect," "may," "positioned," "project," "projected," "should," "will," "would" or similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements that represent the Company’s current judgment about possible future events. The Company believes these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors. Such factors might include, among others, the Company’s ability to comply with the requirements of its credit agreements; the availability of funding under such credit agreements; the Company’s ability to maintain adequate liquidity and financing sources and an appropriate level of debt; changes in general economic conditions which could affect customer payment practices or consumer spending; the impact of changes in general economic conditions on the Company’s customers; changes in demand for the Company’s products; shortages of and price volatility for certain commodities; significant changes in the competitive environment and the effect of competition on the Company’s markets, including on the Company’s pricing policies, financing sources and an appropriate level of debt. Lifetime Brands, Inc.    Lifetime Brands is a leading global provider of kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home. The Company markets its products under well-known kitchenware brands, including Farberware®, KitchenAid®, Sabatier®, Amco Houseworks®, Chicago™ Metallic, Copco®, Fred® & Friends, Kitchen Craft®, Kamenstein®, Kizmos™, La Cafetière®, Misto®, Mossy Oak®, Reo®, Savora™, Swing-A-Way® and Vasconia®; respected tableware and giftware brands, including Mikasa®, Pfaltzgraff®, Creative Tops®, Empire Silver™, Gorham®, International® Silver, Kirk Stieff®, Towle® Silversmiths, Tuttle®, Wallace®, Wilton Armetale®, V&A® and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew®; and valued home solutions brands, including Bombay®, BUILT NY®, Debbie Meyer® and Design for Living™.

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

Captain Brian Collins

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

Vitamin Research Products - LipiControl (180 Caps) 


                        Heart health is a primary concern for many people, and LipiControl is an effective, natural product formulated to promote heart health. Designed for people interested in maintaining a healthy balance of lipids (fats and sterols) in their blood, LipiControl is a powerful and effective combination of                        
                             herbs and vitamins shown to support and manage healthy lipid levels, vascular function, and circulation. How LipiControl Works LipiControl is a science-based formula that combines the non-flush form of niacin (vitamin B3) with balanced amounts of gamma oryzanol, beta-sitosterol, red yeast, and guggulipid to:  inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver and modulate bile acid metabolism. decrease cholesterol absorption and increase cholesterol excretion. helps maintain normal levels of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.  LipiControl Benefits  Helps Maintain Healthy Cholesterol Levels Promotes a Healthy Inflammatory Response Supports Cardiovascular Health  LipiControl's IngredientsThis science-based formula includes the nonflush form of niacin (vitamin B3), gamma oryzanol, beta-sitosterol, red yeast rice, and guggulipid. Guggulipid contains the active constituents guggulsterones, which can inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver and modulate bile acid metabolism. Gamma-oryzanol, derived from rice bran oil, is another substance that can support healthy lipid levels. Evidence suggests that gamma-oryzanol acts by decreasing cholesterol absorption and increasing cholesterol excretion. Other compounds in LipiControl known to play a role in lipid health include beta-sitosterol and niacin. Beta-sitosterol, a plant sterol similar in structure to cholesterol, inhibits cholesterol absorption and helps maintain normal levels of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Niacin (vitamin B3) also often is used to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. Inositol hexanicotinate, which causes less or no flushing seen with niacin or nicotinic acid supplementation, is therefore preferred by many people. To round out your heart health regimen, eat a healthy diet and consider using Coenzyme Q10 with LipiControl, another supplement well-documented for heart health.*Recommended LipiControl Dosage: 2 capsules, 3 times per day with meals.Cautions:Red Yeast Rice may cause muscle cramps, weakness and fatigue in some individuals. These effects may be relieved by increasing the dosage of CoQ10. Red Yeast Rice extract may also cause significant elevations in liver enzymes in approximately 1% of those who take it. Red Yeast Rice extract should not be taken by those with a history of liver disease unless under the supervision of a health care professional. We suggest that the liver enzymes be monitored periodically. Do not use if pregnant or lactating.

Vitamin Research Products - BioDIM (150 mg, 60 Caps) 


                        Promotes healthy hormone balance* Supports breast, cervical and prostate health*  BioDIM helps activate pathways that encourage healthy hormone balance, body weight and immune health. It has also been shown to maintain health of cells of the breast, ovaries and prostate.* What is BioDIM? BioDIM is                        
                             patented form of diindolylmethane (DIM). DIM is an antioxidant and valuable phytonutrient with unique health benefits.* Where does DIM come from? DIM is the major metabolite of indole-3-carbinol, a constituent of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage. Indole-3-carbinol is considered the source of the health benefits associated with cruciferous vegetables, and naturally converts to DIM (about 10%) in the stomach.* Research update: BioDIM has demonstrated benefits for breast and cervical health. BioDIM helps guide estrogen metabolism to produce healthy and protective 2-hydroxy estrogens, and balances inflammatory response.* There are currently 7 human clinical trials using DIM underway in the United States (2009). Most are investigating the influence of DIM on promoting cellular health  in the prostate, cervix and in lungs.* Patented Technology Our BioDIM is made using a patented microencapsulation process that significantly improves absorption compared to other DIM products. Delivered in vegetarian capsules. Recommended Dosage: 8081 — Take 1 capsule up to four times per day or as directed by your healthcare professional. 8085 — Take 1 capsule up to two times per day.

                        Glabrinex research is in: In double-blind, placebocontrolled, 12 week studies, Glabridin (the active ingredient in Glabrinex) has been shown to reduce body weight, waist circumference, and abdominal fat, and also helps to maintain healthy blood glucose levels in conjunction with a healthy diet and                        
                             lifestyle program.* Do you carry excess belly fat around your waist? If so, chances are you have visceral fat. This type of fat surrounds your internal organs. The patent-pending ingredient in Glabrinex helps reduce visceral fat in two ways.* It lessens the body's own natural fat forming processes, while it increases the activity of fat-burning enzymes.* Glabrinex is derived from the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra, a plant that's been safely used for millennia. Glabrinex Benefits:  Suppresses the Formation of Visceral Fat.* May Support Healthy Blood Sugar Levels When Used as a Part of the Diet.* Helps Reduce Body Weight and Waist Circumference in Conjunction With a Healthy Lifestyle Plan.*  Study references can be found here: Tominaga et al., 2009 study abstract and Tominaga et al., 2006 study PDF.Recommended Glabrinex Dosage: 9060 — Take 3 capsules per day with the evening meal. Caution: Certain polyphenols like glabridin may act as natural phytoestrogens. If you have a medical condition, if you are taking aromatase inhibitors or other medication, or if you are pregnant or nursing, consult your healthcare professional before using Glabrinex.

Vitamin Research Products - Bioflavonoid Complex with Quercetin (120 Caps) 


                        What Are Bioflavonoids? Hippocrates, the “father of medicine,” once said to “let food be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy food”—and he wasn't far from the truth! Bioflavonoids, also called vitamin P complex, are found in fruits and vegetables and are part of a                        
                             group of molecules called polyphenols. Bioflavonoids contribute to the colors—typically yellow, orange, and red—and tastes of many of the fruits and vegetables that we eat, but more importantly, they possess several nutritional benefits, as well. Plants and spices containing bioflavonoids have traditionally been used in eastern medicine and studied as a contributing factor to the outstanding heart health of the French and Mediterranean populations. Bioflavonoids also demonstrate antioxidant activity, as they are able to neutralize the free radicals that can cause oxidative stress damage to many of our cells. What Is Quercetin? Quercetin, pronounced KWAIR-suh-ten, is a bioflavonoid typically found in apple skins and berries; it's also present in some teas and red wines. Scientific and clinical research has shown that quercetin has an impressive array of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which has spurred medical and athletic communities alike to investigate its benefits on mental and physical performance. Quercetin has also been shown to promote heart and vascular health, immune health, prostate health, respiratory health, and more. As an antioxidant, quercetin truly shines. It has a chemical structure that naturally counteracts the damage to your cells caused by free radicals. Oxidation reactions, which produce free radicals, frequently occur after exposure to environmental toxins, cigarette smoke, and fried foods; quercetin's top-notch ability to “scavenge” or neutralize these free radicals is believed to play a part in how it enhances and improves endurance and physical performance. The Benefits of Bioflavonoids and Quercetin Several clinical studies in the past 20 years that have shown that bioflavonoids have a positive effect on overall health and express several beneficial effects. Bioflavonoids... Act as natural antioxidants, promoting overall health and cell integrity Enhance eye health and support optimal vision Enhance heart health and vascular health Support healthy connective tissues and skin Strengthen the immune system Support digestive health Naturally support healthy histamine levels to strengthen respiratory health Quercetin in particular also has some great benefits: Enhances and supports eye health Reduces oxidation of LDL  Supports brain health Increases physical endurance and supports optimal physical performance Supports healthy blood pressure Acts as a beneficial antioxidant Protects and supports heart health Supports respiratory health Regulates and supports healthy inflammation levels Helps increase aerobic capacity by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis Why Buy VRP's Bioflavonoid Complex With Quercetin? Bioflavonoids work best when paired with other antioxidants, forming a multi-approach protective force for your body's most important systems: heart, lungs, brain, and nerves. When you can reap all the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that bioflavonoids sow, in addition to quercetin's amazing effects on your well-being and physical performance—why wait? With VRP's Bioflavonoid Complex With Quercetin, you can have two great supplements in one affordable bottle!Recommended Dosage: 1480 — Take 2 capsules up to three times per day with meals.

Lipoic acid is one of the most thoroughly investigated dietary supplements, and many healthcare practitioners agree it is a protective supplement of choice. (R)-Lipoic                        
                             acid is a more potent form—the biologically active form—of alpha lipoic acid. As such, it offers more benefit with a lower dose. (R)-Lipoic acid serves to regenerate vitamins C and E and helps maintain glutathione levels, a vital cellular antioxidant and liver protectant. It is a neuroprotective nutrient. It works throughout the body to support vascular integrity. It also promotes eye health and strong immune function.*Recommended Dosage: 3453 — Take 1 capsule up to three times per day.

Vitamin Research Products - Alpha Lipoic Acid (100 mg, 60 Caps) 


                        What Is Lipoic Acid? Lipoic acid is a powerful antioxidant that protects and repairs cells and reduces damage caused by oxidation; it also improves the efficacy of vitamins C and E, two other well-known antioxidants. Lipoic acid supports liver health, immune system function, healthy circulation,                        
                             clear vision, and glucose metabolism, as well as cardiovascular and neurological health. It's an important component of metabolic systems, and since it's both fat- and water-soluble, it has unique characteristics and a distinct advantage over other antioxidants.* Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally-occurring compound that our body produces and that we also consume from dietary sources, such as red meat, spinach, and wheat germ. While our body produces sufficient lipoic acid under normal circumstances, it may be considered a “conditionally-essential” nutrient like coenzyme Q10, where the body's own manufacture of alpha-lipoic acid may not be enough during conditions of oxidative stress. In situations like this, or for individuals who have a natural deficiency of this important antioxidant, supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid would be extremely beneficial.* Alpha-Lipoic Acid's Two Primary Functions Alpha-lipoic acid serves two vital roles in the human body: it's an antioxidant, as mentioned above, and also a coenzyme that facilitates the action of enzymes in several metabolic functions.* As an antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid is useful in both oxidized and reduced forms, which is rare among antioxidants. In its oxidized form, lipoic acid can scavenge free radicals and chelate, or bond with, metals. In its reduced form as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), it can regenerate other antioxidants like vitamins C and E and glutathione, as well as repair oxidative damage. Alpha-lipoic acid is a “broad spectrum” antioxidant because of its activity in both oxidized and reduced forms; it's even more powerful an antioxidant than vitamin C or glutathione, which makes it extremely potent indeed.* In addition to its antioxidant duties, alpha-lipoic acid also serves as a coenzyme for the group of enzymes responsible for converting fats, carbohydrates, and proteins to biological energy or “cell fuel.” This conversion takes place in the mitochondria, the “battery” of your cell. Alpha-lipoic acid helps “burn” the metabolic intermediates and create energy for the cell's easy and immediate use.* Lipoic Acid and Healthy Blood Sugar Metabolism Plenty of evidence links increased oxidative stress with blood sugar imbalances, as well as with insulin inefficiency. Unbalanced blood sugar levels may lead to increased production of free radicals. Oxidative stress can impact insulin-stimulated glucose transportation and activation of insulin receptors, making it harder for the body to move and detect sufficient levels of insulin in the blood. Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to protect against the oxidative damage - so well, in fact, that scientists are acknowledging its ability to support tissue health, even in instances where blood sugar levels are out of balance. ALA supplementation has also been found to support normal insulin sensitivity and efficiency. In Germany, lipoic acid is used as a nutrient to support nerve health, which can be impacted by blood sugar imbalances.* Scientists and doctors agree that oxidized LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, is a high risk factor for sub-optimal cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that alpha-lipoic acid can protect the integrity of LDL and other lipid molecules that have been exposed to oxidative stress, as well as protect against protein glycation - which causes the production of free radicals and more oxidative damage. That makes ALA doubly effective in enhancing cardiovascular health.* Unbalanced blood sugar levels can also lead to an accumulation of sorbitol in the eye's lens, which can eventually affect visual function. As a nutrient with anti-glycation and antioxidant effects, alpha-lipoic acid ha

Vitamin Research Products - EpiCor (500 mg, 30 Caps) 


                        What is EpiCor? EpiCor is a fermented form of a species of yeast called Saccharaomyces cerevisiae, which is the main source of nutritional yeast and yeast extract. Also known as Dried Yeast Fermentate and Brewer's Yeast, this microscopic unicellular fungi is often used in commercial food products                        
                             and alcoholic fermentation. This yeast is rich in amino acids, vitamins, and enzymes that help boost your immune system and support your health against common seasonal ailments*.EpiCor helps balance your immune system in three ways: it helps strengthen your skin and mucous membranes (your body's first line of defense), it stimulates your immune cells, and it supports the production of T-cell and B-cell immune factors*.EpiCor is unlike any other ingredient on the market—it's not an herb, vitamin, or mushroom. This all-natural, high-metabolite immunogen has been shown to promote the body's natural defense mechanisms and balance the body's inflammatory response*.How EpiCor is MadeIn 1943, a company in Iowa began manufacturing a fermented yeast product that was and still is used as an additive for animal feed to help improve digestion and overall wellness. This company became aware of the unusually good health among the employees. Their subsequent investigation led to the discovery and production of EpiCor as a supplement to support human immune health.EpiCor production utilizes a proprietary process called MetaGen4, a multi-stage fermentation and drying process. It contains both the yeast itself and the metabolites formed by the fermentation process.Fermentation is simply the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol. This process is well-known to produce alcoholic beverages, but it is also used in the leavening of bread and for the production of lactic acid in sour foods such as sauerkraut, yogurt, and pickled foods.EpiCor and Immune HealthStudies indicate that EpiCor can support your immune system—including a reduction of symptoms resulting from seasonal challenges—and improve antioxidant protection capacity*.Clinical Support For EpiCorIn a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, participants who took EpiCor had fewer health complaints than the placebo group, which showed no changes. That data suggested that EpiCor supports the formation of healthy red blood cells, supports mucosal defense, and provides inflammatory-balancing activity*.Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial confirmed the immune-supporting benefits of EpiCor. Subjects taking EpiCor experienced reductions in the symptoms associated with seasonal immune complaints and experienced an overall shorter duration of symptoms compared to the placebo group.The study associated with the initial discovery of EpiCor's benefits compared the blood of 10 fermentation plant workers to age- and gender-matched controls. The results showed that the plant workers had significantly improved natural killer (NK) cell activity, higher killing efficiency of NK cells, higher levels of red blood cell intracellular glutathione, and lower levels of immune complexes. Lowered immune complexes results in less inflammation and tissue damage.EpiCor's antioxidant activity was verified by the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity assay (ORAC), which means extra protection in fighting off the free radicals that can compromise your overall health. Why Buy EpiCor? The most well-known and best studied benefit of EpiCor is enhanced immune health, but promising research shows that EpiCor can also be used for... Healthy immune defenses against seasonal challenges* Increased antioxidant protection* Cellular metabolism support* EpiCor helps stimulate intestinal enzymes and can help relieve occasional diarrhea. You need all the help you can get for supporting immune health throughout the year, so why not try EpiCor to promote immune health and overall wellness?Recommended EpiCor Dosage: Take 1 capsule daily.

Vitamin Research Products - Lithium Orotate (120 Caps) 


                        The surprisingly simple solution for mood management*.Lithium Orotate is a trace mineral that may helpsto boost and balance your moods. Studies show it also helps promote mental focus and may improve memory.* Lithium Orotate is easily absorbed, and is 20 times more bioactive than other lithium                        
                             salts, thereby allowing the individual to take smaller amounts.* Each capsule provides 4.8 mg of elemental lithium. When salts of lithium are ingested, the lithium ions interact with several neurotransmitters and recepters in the central nervous system, resulting in decreased norepinephrine release and increased seratonin synthesis.Lithium, like sodium, occurs naturally in a number of different salts. Lithium orotate is a highly bioavailable form of lithium that is available as a dietary supplement. Because of its superior bioavailability, lower doses of lithium orotate may be used to achieve healthy brain lithium concentrations and relatively stable serum concentrations*.Recommended Lithium Orotate Dosage: 1 capsule twice per day with meals.Cautions:Lithium should not be used by individuals with renal or cardiovascular diseases, severe debilitation or dehydration, or sodium depletion, and by individuals who are taking diuretics or ACE inhibitors. Consult your doctor before use if you are taking anti-hypertensive drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesic drugs or insulin. Lithium should not be used by pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers.

Vitamin Research Products - Ethyl EPA (1000 mg, 60 Caps) 


                        EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids, the essential fats. Omega-3 fats play key roles in behavior and brain development in growing years, and heart, brain, joint and vascular function and maintenance in mature years.* The importance of omega-3 fats in heart and vascular health, as well as joint                        
                             conditions, is well documented, yet most Americans underconsume these healthy fats.* The American Heart Association now recommends regular consumption of omega-3 fats from fish or fish oil supplements. Research also shows that omega-3 fats, as little as 1,000 mg of EPA per day, measurably improves mood.* Furthermore, clinical trials using fish oil supplements have been shown to increase focus and attention in children with behavior concerns.* EthylEPA delivers EPA and DHA from cold-water fish in a 3:2 ratio (300 mg EPA: 200 mg DHA per capsule). The small amount of vitamin E added is to maintain freshness and stability. Recommended Dosage:3341 — Take 1 softgel up to two times per day with meals.

Vitamin Research Products - Policosanol (10 mg, 60 Caps) 


                        Policosanol supports healthy circulation and helps maintain cholesterol levels already in the normal range.*  What is policosanol? Policosanol is a unique source of natural compounds from sugar cane. Policosanol is comprised of various aliphatic waxy alcohols (e.g. octacosanol). Aliphatic compounds                        
                             are a type of compound that occurs in plants. Soluble fiber is another type of compound that occurs in plants. Research Findings Research indicates that long chain aliphatic compounds in policosanol support healthy total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol already in the normal ranges , promote healthy circulation and are well tolerated.* When compared to other products used to support healthy cholesterol levels, policosanol was found to perform as good or better. An added benefit was reported; individuals participating in the policosanol studies tended to stay in the studies and not drop out.* Benefits have been reported in healthy adults and those who manage healthy blood sugar levels.* Like other over-the-counter products, policosanol can support normal platelet aggregation. This may be a benefit for many people, however, talk with your healthcare practitioner if you have concerns with blood viscosity or are planning medical procedures.* We offer 10 mg policosanol with 100 mg oat bran fiber in vegetarian capsules. 10 — 20 mg of policosanol per day, in divided doses, is most recommended. Oat bran fiber provides additional support for healthy cholesterol levels.* Recommended Dosage: 5042 — Take two to three capsules per day in divided doses.

Vitamin Research Products - BioDIM (75 mg, 60 Caps) 


                        Promotes healthy hormone balance* Supports breast, cervical and prostate health*  BioDIM helps activate pathways that encourage healthy hormone balance, body weight and immune health. It has also been shown to maintain health of cells of the breast, ovaries and prostate.* What is BioDIM? BioDIM is                        
                             patented form of diindolylmethane (DIM). DIM is an antioxidant and valuable phytonutrient with unique health benefits.* Where does DIM come from? DIM is the major metabolite of indole-3-carbinol, a constituent of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage.

BioDIM helps guide estrogen metabolism to produce healthy and protective 2-hydroxy estrogens, and balances inflammatory response.* There are currently 7 human clinical trials using DIM underway in the United States (2009). Most are investigating the influence of DIM on promoting cellular health  in the prostate, cervix and in lungs.* Patented Technology Our BioDIM is made using a patented microencapsulation process that significantly improves absorption compared to other DIM products. Delivered in vegetarian capsules. Recommended Dosage: 8081 — Take 1 capsule up to four times per day or as directed by your healthcare professional. 8085 — Take 1 capsule up to two times per day.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
