AFH
ACQUISITION VIII, INC.

(A
DELAWARE CORPORATION)

 



NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


 

Note 1 -
The Company

 

AFH
Acquisition VIII, Inc., a development stage company (the
“Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware on October 18, 2007. The Company is 100% owned by
AFH Holding & Advisory, LLC (the “Parent”). The
financial statements presented represent only those transactions of
AFH Acquisition VIII, Inc. The Company is looking to acquire an
existing company or acquire the technology to begin
operations.

 

As a blank
check company, the Company’s business is to pursue a business
combination through acquisition, or merger with, an existing
company. As of the date of the financial statements, the Company is
not conducting negotiations with any target business. No assurances
can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or
negotiating with any target company.

 

Since
inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts.

 

Note 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Method of
Accounting

The
Company maintains its books and prepares its financial statements
on the accrual basis of accounting.  

 

 

 

Loss per
Common Share

Loss per
common share is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10, by
dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for each
period

 

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results can differ from those estimates.

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC
740-10, using the asset and liability approach, which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities.
This method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the
year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and
gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon
enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation
allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax
credit carry forwards. Deferred income tax expense represents the
change in net deferred assets and liability balances.

 

Financial
Instruments

The
Company’s financial instruments consist due to parent. Unless
otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company
is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks
arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these
financial instruments approximates their carrying value, unless
otherwise noted.

Recent
Pronouncements

In January
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-1, “Simplifying Income
Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary
Items”, which eliminates the concept from U.S. GAAP the
concept of an extraordinary item. Under the ASU, an entity will no
longer (1) segregate an extraordinary item from the results of
ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item
on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing
operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share
data applicable to an extraordinary item. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company’s effective date for adoption is
January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect this accounting update
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements
in future periods, although that could change

 

There are
no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that the Company
has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on its
financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

 

Note 3 -
Equity Securities

 

Holders of
shares of common stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each
common share held at all stockholder’s meetings for all
purposes, including the election of directors. The common stock
does not have cumulative voting rights.

The
preferred stock of the Company shall be issued by the Board of
Directors of the Company in one or more classes or one or more
series within any class and such classes or series shall have such
voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such
designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions as the Board
of Directors of the Company may determine, from time to
time.

No holder
of shares of stock of any class shall be entitled as a matter of
right to subscribe for or purchase or receive any part of any new
or additional issue of shares of stock of any class, or of
securities convertible into shares of stock or any class, whether
now hereafter authorized or whether issued for money, for
consideration other than money, or by way of dividend.

As of
July 31, 2016, there were no preferred shares issued and
outstanding and 5,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding to
AFH Holding & Advisory LLC.

Note 4 -
Going Concern

 

The
Company’s financial statements have been presented on the
basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring
losses from operations. As a result, there is an accumulated
deficit of $75,995 at July 31, 2016.

 

The
Company’s continued existence is dependent upon its ability
to raise capital or acquire a marketable company. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

Note 5 -
Due to Parent

 

Due to
parent represents cash advances from AFH Holding & Advisory
LLC. AFH Holding & Advisory LLC is the majority shareholder of
the Company. They are due on demand and will be paid when the

Related Parties

 

Litigation
with AFH Advisory and Amir F. Heshmatpour

 

Emmaus
Life Sciences, Inc.

AFH
Advisory is presently a plaintiff and a counterclaim defendant in a
matter that is pending in both Delaware Superior Court (Index No.
N12C-09-045-MMJ [CCLD]) and Delaware Chancery Court (Index No. C.A.
No. 8005-JJ). AFH Advisory brought the suit against Emmaus Life
Sciences, Inc. ("Emmaus") in regards to Emmaus' attempt to cancel
AFH Advisory's ownership interest in Emmaus, and its refusal to
reimburse AFH Advisory for expenses relating to a reverse merger.
Emmaus has brought counterclaims against AFH Advisory for a
declaratory judgment canceling AFH Advisory's ownership interest in
Emmaus, fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. All
parties completed document discovery and filed motions for summary
judgment. Emmaus' motion for partial summary judgment was granted
by the Court, which held that the Third Letter of Intent ("LOI
III") between AFH Advisory and Emmaus was terminated, the public
offering contemplated by LOI III was terminated, the advisor shares
Emmaus gave to AFH Advisory and its affiliates pursuant to the
terms of LOI III had been canceled, and that AFH and its affiliated
must return all Emmaus shares in their possession.   The
partial summary judgment motion brought by individual counterclaim
defendant Amir Heshmatpour, and joined in by AFH Advisory, was
granted in part by the Court, which held that Emmaus was not
entitled to compensatory damages on its fraud and fraud in the
inducement claims. Following the Court's decision on these summary
judgment motions, AFH Advisory does not have any remaining claims
against Emmaus. Emmaus continues to maintain claims against AFH
Advisory for breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. AFH
Advisory has asserted defenses for these remaining claims, and it
is defending this matter. Pursuant to a settlement agreement with
Emmaus, the terms of which are confidential, the fraud claims
against AFH and Heshmatpour brought by Emmaus have been dismissed.
On April 7, 2015, a settlement of all claims   was reached between the parties
whereby AFH Advisory agreed to transfer publicly traded securities
of one of AFH’s portfolio companies to Emmaus   with a   current   trading value of $30,000.

Emerald
Dairy, Inc.

AFH
Advisory and other entities brought a lawsuit in the Superior Court
of California, Los Angeles County against Emerald Dairy, Inc.
(“Emerald”) and its Chairman, Mr. Shan, asserting that
they were entitled to a large number of shares of Emerald, both
from Emerald and from shares individually owned, and pledged, by
Chairman Shan. Emerald and Chairman Shan defaulted.  On March
27, 2015, a default judgment was issued by the Superior Court of
California in favor of AFH Advisory in the amount of $1,132,181
which includes damages of $897,121, prejudgment interest of
$224,260, and attorney fees of $10,800. 

 

Banner
Bank Judgment

Mr. Amir
Heshmatpour is a defendant in two lawsuits related to Banner Bank
which have been reduced to judgment.

 

The
lawsuits arise from three loans issued in the late 1990’s.
The lender was Town Bank, a Washington State Bank which is no
longer in existence, having been acquired by Banner Bank in the
early 2000’s. The borrowers on the three separate loans were
H&H Holdings, Metrophone Telecom, and Amir and Kathy
Heshmatpour. In the early 2000’s, the three loans were
consolidated into one loan, shortly before Banner Bank acquired
Town Bank. Once this acquisition occurred, the relationship between
the borrowers and the successor lender soured, and a default was
ultimately declared on the loans.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Certain statements made
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of AFH Acquisition VII, Inc.
(the “Company”) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements.
 
The following factors and
risks, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: inability to
consummate the proposed merger with Eurocar and Park Place; business conditions in the U.S.; changing interpretations of generally
accepted accounting principles; requirements or changes adversely affecting the business in which the Company is engaged; management
of rapid growth; intensity of competition; and the Company’s ability to raise necessary funds.
 
The forward-looking statements
included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s plans and
objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions,
all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although
the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove
inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate.
In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will
be achieved.

in the State of Delaware on September 24, 2007. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining
initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination. The business purpose of the Company is
to seek the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company. As described below, the Company has engaged in efforts to identify
suitable target companies. However, the Company has not entered into a definitive agreement concerning any target business.
 
Letter of Intent with Eurocar and Park Place
 
On October 5, 2012, AFH
Holding & Advisory, LLC (“AFH Advisory”), a major shareholder of the Company, entered into a letter of intent (the
“LOI”) with two target companies, Eurocar, Inc. (“Eurocar”) and Park Place Motors Ltd. (“Park Place,”
together with Eurocar, the “Target Companies”), pursuant to which the Company would acquire the Target Companies through
a series of transactions including a merger or other business combination pursuant to which the Company would cease to be a shell
company, as defined in the rules of the SEC (the “Reverse Merger”).
 
On October 26, 2012, AFH
Advisory, Eurocar and Park Place entered into an amendment to the LOI, pursuant to which the parties to the LOI agreed to revise
the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company post Reverse Merger. On January 28, 2013, the parties to
the LOI entered into an Amended and Restated Letter of Intent (the “Amended and Restated LOI”), pursuant to which the
parties to the LOI agreed to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company post Reverse Merger,
provided for certain acknowledgments regarding the proceeds of the Offering, amended a provision regarding a potential subsequent
financing and amended certain financial representations made by each of Eurocar and Park Place. On February 1, 2013, the parties
to the Amended and Restated LOI entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated LOI to revise, among other things, the beneficial
ownership of the Company post Reverse Merger. On May 20, 2013, the parties to the Amended and Restated LOI entered into a Second
Amended and Restated Letter of Intent (the “Second Amended and Restated LOI”).
 
The Target Companies acknowledged
and agreed that they shall not be entitled to the proceeds of the Offering, $1.2 million of which will be kept in AFH Advisory’s
account and used by AFH Advisory for all expenses incurred by AFH Advisory in connection with the Offering, the Reverse Merger
and all related going public expenses (the “Going Public Expenses”). The remaining proceeds of the Offering will also
be kept in AFH Advisory’s account and allocated by AFH Advisory in its sole discretion for any expenses incurred by the Company
in connection with the Going Public Expenses. In the event the Reverse Merger does not take place, any remaining proceeds of the
Offering that have not been used in connection with the Offering, the Reverse Merger and the Going Public Expenses will be used
in a future transaction. To date, in excess of $1,860,700 has been either spent or allocated for certain expenses. To the extent
AFH Advisory advances expenses to the Company in an amount in excess of the total proceeds raised in the Offering, AFH Advisory
shall be entitled to be reimbursed such amount.
 
 Current Status of Letter of Intent
with EuroCar and Park Place
 
Subsequent to the events
referenced above, EuroCar informed the Company that it was not proceeding forward with the terms of the LOI, as amended. Furthermore,
Park Place has expressed a reluctance to proceed forward under the terms of the LOI, as amended. As such, there is a substantial
likelihood that AFH will not effect the acquisition of Park Place and that the Reverse Merger referenced above will not be consummated.
For this reason, AFH has decided to pursue other targets to acquire. It is currently expected that any acquisition target will
be an entity focuses on the automobile space, whether that be a new and/or used car retailer and/or such an entity with an additional
primary focus on automotive repairs and ancillary services.

In addition to the efforts
described above, the Company has not restricted its search for any specific kind of businesses, and it may acquire a business which
is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its business life. It
is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged, in that such business may need to
seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which the Company
may offer.
 
In implementing a structure
for a particular business acquisition, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture,
or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity.
 
It is anticipated that
any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable
federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, the Company may
agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter.
If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into an agreement for
a business combination or has consummated a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their potential sale
into any trading market which may develop in the Company’s securities may depress the market value of the Company’s
securities in the future if such a market develops, of which there is no assurance. However, if the Company cannot effect a non-cash
acquisition, the Company may have to raise funds from a private offering of its securities under Rule 506 of Regulation D. There
is no assurance the Company would obtain any such equity funding.
	 
The Company will participate
in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Negotiations with a target company
will likely focus on the percentage of the Company which the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings.
 
Although the terms of such
agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto,
will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties
prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can
be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company’s shareholders at such
time.
 
Private Placement Commencing from October
2012
 
In October 2012, the Company
commenced a private placement offering, as amended, (the “Offering”) to several accredited investors (the “Purchasers”)
for up to 1,300,000 Shares for aggregate proceeds equal to $2,600,000. No warrants were issued to investors in the Offering. The
Offering was conducted pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant
to Regulation D, Section 4(2) and Rule 506 thereunder.
 
Proceeds from the Offering
were used to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Reverse Merger with the Target Companies as indicated in the
Second Amended and Restated LOI.
 
The Offering was undertaken
pursuant to a definitive Subscription Agreement between the Company and the Purchasers (the “Subscription Agreement”),
which contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties.
 
As
of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has received proceeds in an aggregate amount of $1,815,700. No additional amounts
are expected to be raised further to the Offering until such time as other acquisition targets are identified.
 
Business Strategy
 
The
Company, based on proposed business activities, is a “blank check” company. The SEC defines such a company as “a
development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in
a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person and is issuing ‘penny stock,’
as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies
as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets (other than cash or cash equivalents).
Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies
in their respective jurisdictions, and certain SEC rules and regulations restrict the activities of both blank check and shell
companies. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in any of our securities, either debt
or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking
the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12
months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate,
short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry
or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The Company will seek to consummate its acquisition with
Eurocar and Park Place, but if that is not completed, it will continue its search for an appropriate operating business with which
to consider consummating a business combination.
 
The
analysis of new business opportunities has and will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s management.
The Company has considered potential acquisition transactions, but while one of its principal stockholders entered into the LOI
with Eurocar and Park Place which contemplates a business combination between Eurocar, Park Place and AFH, as of this date has
not entered into any definitive agreement with any party. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating
in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following
kinds of factors:
 
(a) Potential for growth,
indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
(b) Competitive position
as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
(c) Strength and diversity
of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
(d) Capital requirements
and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional
securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
(e) The cost of participation
by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
(f) The extent to which
the business opportunity can be advanced;
(g) The accessibility of
required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
(h) Other relevant factors.
 
In applying the foregoing
criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination
based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many
different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis
of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company’s limited capital available for investigation,
the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In addition, we will be
competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing
business combinations. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of
potential targets as possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel
and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities.
 
We expect that our due
diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of
its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence
review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, including but not limited to
attorneys, accountants, consultants or other such professionals. At this time the Company has not specifically identified any third
parties that it may engage, except that AFH Advisory, whose sole member and manager is our President and Secretary, Amir F. Heshmatpour,
may assist the Company with due diligence in identifying a business combination target. The costs associated with hiring third
parties as required to complete a business combination may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may be vary
depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the
target company, and the size and complexity of the business of the target company.

Our limited funds and the
lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis
of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without
detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would
be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors
or other associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
We do not currently intend
to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses. However,
we contemplate that at least one of the third parties who may introduce business combinations to us may be AFH Advisory. There
are currently no agreements or preliminary agreements or understandings between us and AFH Advisory other than those already disclosed.
Any transaction or consulting fees paid to AFH Advisory will be comparable with unaffiliated third party fees.
 
The time and costs required
to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with
any degree of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company, and
the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing
a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to complete a business combination can be estimated once a business
combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to the evaluation of a prospective business combination
that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
The Company is in a highly
competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful
business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint
ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities,
including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable
target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial
capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities
and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and
consummating a successful business combination.
 
Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which the
Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the
Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Company
will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of its Common Stock or other securities of the Company.
Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for
determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more
of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than
other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20%
or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity.
 
Under other circumstances,
depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the
total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity
of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. The Company does not intend to supply disclosure to
shareholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction, unless required by applicable
law or regulation. In the event a proposed business combination involves a change in majority of directors of the Company, the
Company will file and provide to shareholders a Schedule 14F-1, which shall include, information concerning the target company,
as required. The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K, as required, within four business days of a business combination
which results in the Company ceasing to be a shell company. This Form 8-K will include complete disclosure of the target company,
including audited financial statements.

The controlling stockholders
of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization transaction.
As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company’s directors may resign and one or more new directors may
be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In the case of an acquisition,
the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In
the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’
meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder
approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to
certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as
not to require stockholder approval.
 
It is anticipated that
the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure
documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys
and others. The costs that will be incurred are not ascertainable at this time as the costs are expected to be tied to the amount
of time it takes to identify and complete a business combination transaction as well as the specific factors related to the business
combination target that is chosen, including such factors as the location, size and complexity of the business of the target company.
If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation
might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity,
the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
We presently have no employees
apart from our management. Our sole officer and our directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they
will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We
expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
 
On September 24, 2007,
the Company offered and sold 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock for aggregate proceeds equal to $25,000 to Amir Farrokh Heshmatpour,
our sole officer and a director. The Company sold these shares of Common Stock under the exemption from registration provided by
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. On August 7, 2008, Mr. Heshmatpour contributed his 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock to AFH
Holding & Advisory, LLC, where such contribution was deemed an additional capital contribution to AFH Holding & Advisory,
LLC.
 
In
October 2012, the Company commenced a private placement offering, as amended, (the “Offering”) to several accredited
investors (the “Purchasers”) for up to 1,300,000 Shares (the “Maximum Offering”) for aggregate proceeds
equal to $2,600,000 (the “Maximum Offering Amount”)The Company may increase the Maximum Offering to 1,560,000 Shares
and the Maximum Offering Amount to $3,120,000 to cover over-allotments. There is no minimum number of Shares that may be purchased
in the Offering. No warrants were issued to investors in the Offering. The Offering was conducted pursuant to an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Regulation D, Section 4(2) and Rule 506 thereunder.
 
Proceeds
from the Offering were used to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Reverse Merger with the Target Companies as
indicated in the Second Amended and Restated LOI.
 
The
Offering was undertaken pursuant to a definitive Subscription Agreement between the Company and the Purchasers (the “Subscription
Agreement”), which contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties.
 
As
of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has received proceeds in an aggregate amount of $1,815,700 and entered into stock
subscriptions for the issuance of 907,850 shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Offering.

Item 6. 
Selected Financial Data.

 
As a “smaller reporting company”
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.
 


Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

 
The Company currently does not engage in any
business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:
 
(i) filing Exchange Act reports, and
(ii) investigating, analyzing and consummating
an acquisition.
 
We believe we will be able to meet these costs
through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary,
to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
 
The Company may consider acquiring a business
which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or
markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating
difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or
merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market
for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur
in a public offering.
 
Any target business that is selected may be
a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established
records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially
unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity
in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
 
The Company anticipates that the selection
of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances
being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking
even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation.
Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms
on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating
a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring
acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur
in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
As of October 31, 2014,
the Company had assets equal to $62,695, comprised of deferred expenses. This compares with assets of $63,208, comprised
of cash and cash equivalents and deferred expenses, as of October 31, 2013. The Company’s current liabilities as of October
31, 2014 totaled $93,020, comprised of accrued expenses and monies due to parent. This compares with liabilities of $32,231 comprised
exclusively of accrued expenses and monies due to parent, as of October 31, 2013. The Company can provide no assurance that it
can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.

The Company has nominal assets and has generated
no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its
ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the
Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and
capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.
 
Private Placement Commencing from October
2012
 
In October 2012, the Company
commenced a private placement offering, as amended, (the “Offering”) to several accredited investors (the “Purchasers”)
for up to 1,300,000 Shares for aggregate proceeds equal to $2,600,000 No warrants were issued to investors in the Offering. The
Offering was conducted pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant
to Regulation D, Section 4(2) and Rule 506 thereunder.
 
Proceeds from the Offering
were used to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Reverse Merger with the Target Companies as indicated in the
Second Amended and Restated LOI.
 
The Offering was undertaken
pursuant to a definitive Subscription Agreement between the Company and the Purchasers (the “Subscription Agreement”),
which contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties.
 
As
of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has received proceeds in an aggregate amount of $1,815,700.
 
Results of Operations
 
The Company has not conducted
any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No revenue has been generated
by the Company from September 24, 2007 (Inception) to October 31, 2014. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless
it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. It is management’s
assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plan
of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.
 
For the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2014, the Company had a net loss of $61,302, consisting of legal, accounting, audit, other professional service fees
and expenses incurred in relation to the filing of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form
10-K and $52,253 of reverse merger expenses incurred in the first quarter of our fiscal year.
 
For the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2013, the Company had a net loss of $2,137,837, consisting of legal, accounting, audit, other professional service
fees and expenses incurred in relation to the filing of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on
Form 10-K and reverse merger expenses which represent cash from the private placement offering (see financial statements Note F)
which were used towards fees in relation to the LOI (see financial statements Note A). $1,200,000 of such proceeds were be kept
by the parent, AFH Holding & Advisory.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.

Controls and Procedures.

 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company’s management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal
financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
 
In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including the Company’s President, Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s President, Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
 
Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
 
Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed by, or
under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that:
 


 
1.
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

 
2.
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

 
3.
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our
financial statements would be prevented or detected.
 
Management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2014.

This annual report does
not include a report from the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting
due to the permanent exemption established by the Securities and Exchange Commission for public companies designated as small filers.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
 
The
Company did not maintain effective control over the preparation, review, presentation and disclosure of amounts related to the
stock liability in connection with the September 2012 private placement that were included in balance sheets and statements of
income in 2012. This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the
issuance of stock for services and equity accounts and related financial disclosures that was not prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Due to their relative inexperience, the Company’s accounting staff was not able to properly account for such complex
transactions in a timely manner.
 
During
the quarter ended October 31, 2014, we implemented procedures to assemble, record and maintain information related to complex transactions
including the issuance of stock and stock based transactions. We believe these procedures address our previously disclosed material
weakness.
 
Except
as disclosed above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting with regard to significant deficiencies
that occurred during the year ended October 31, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting.

Litigation with AFH Advisory and Amir F. Heshmatpour
 
Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.
AFH Advisory is presently
a plaintiff and a counterclaim defendant in a matter that is pending in both Delaware Superior Court (Index No. N12C-09-045-MMJ
[CCLD]) and Delaware Chancery Court (Index No. C.A. No. 8005-JJ). AFH Advisory brought the suit against Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.
("Emmaus") in regards to Emmaus' attempt to cancel AFH Advisory's ownership interest in Emmaus, and its refusal to reimburse
AFH Advisory for expenses relating to a reverse merger. Emmaus has brought counterclaims against AFH Advisory for a declaratory
judgment canceling AFH Advisory's ownership interest in Emmaus, fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. All parties completed
document discovery and filed motions for summary judgment. Emmaus' motion for partial summary judgment was granted by the Court,
which held that the Third Letter of Intent ("LOI III") between AFH Advisory and Emmaus was terminated, the public offering
contemplated by LOI III was terminated, the advisor shares Emmaus gave to AFH Advisory and its affiliates pursuant to the terms
of LOI III had been canceled, and that AFH and its affiliated must return all Emmaus shares in their possession. The partial summary
judgment motion brought by individual counterclaim defendant Amir Heshmatpour, and joined in by AFH Advisory, was granted in part
by the Court, which held that Emmaus was not entitled to compensatory damages on its fraud and fraud in the inducement claims.
Following the Court's decision on these summary judgment motions, AFH Advisory does not have any remaining claims against Emmaus.
Emmaus continues to maintain claims against AFH Advisory for breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. AFH Advisory has
asserted defenses for these remaining claims, and it is defending this matter.
Emerald Dairy, Inc.
AFH Advisory and other entities
brought a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County against Emerald Dairy, Inc. (“Emerald”) and
its Chairman, Mr. Shang, asserting that they were entitled to a large number of shares of Emerald, both from Emerald and from shares
individually owned, and pledged, by Chairman Shang. Emerald and Chairman Shang defaulted. There were some efforts to enforce the
judgment against the Chairman in China, where he resides, but we are not aware of the status of those efforts.
Banner Bank Judgment
Mr. Amir Heshmatpour is a
defendant in two lawsuits related to Banner Bank which have been reduced to judgment.
The lawsuits arise from three
loans issued in the late 1990’s. The lender was Town Bank, a Washington State Bank which is no longer in existence, having
been acquired by Banner Bank in the early 2000’s. The borrowers on the three separate loans were H&H Holdings, Metrophone
Telecom, and Amir Heshmatpour. In the early 2000’s, the three loans were consolidated into one loan, shortly before Banner
Bank acquired Town Bank. Once this acquisition occurred, the relationship between the borrowers and the successor lender soured,
and a default was ultimately declared on the loans. Judgments were entered in the Superior Court for the State of Washington in
2003 and in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.
 
Mr. Heshmatpour contends
that negotiated agreements were reached for payment of the outstanding loan balance, resulting in an agreement to pay approximately
$11,000,000. Mr. Heshmatpour further contends that the agreements were satisfied, but that Banner Bank failed to properly account
for the payments received. Since the early 2000’s, Banner Bank has retained judgment creditor status against Mr. Heshmatpour
and his wife, and has added interest to the Superior Court judgment in the amount of approximately 12% per year and to the District
Court action in the amount of approximately 6.875% per year. However, for almost the entire decade, no further collection actions
were taken and Mr. Heshmatpour believed the matter was resolved.
 
The two judgments have recently
been domesticated in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and the California Superior Court.
Banner Bank is seeking to enforce the judgments, and Mr. and Mrs. Heshmatpour, who are unaware of the reasons behind the renewed
activity, have retained counsel to defend them in the enforcement proceedings.
 
In the District Court action, the Court on June
24, 2013 issued an Order charging the ownership interest in AFH Advisory of Amir Heshmatpour with payment of the unpaid balance
in that case of approximately $711,899 and ordering AFH Advisory to pay any distributions due to Amir Heshmatpour directly to Banner
Bank. In the Superior Court action, Amir Heshmatpour filed a motion to vacate and/or reduce sister state judgment in the amount
of approximately $22,873,956.63 which is set for hearing on June 17, 2014. The Superior Court action is otherwise stayed pending
the hearing on June 17, 2014.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
the Company’s directors and officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company’s
equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the Company’s securities
with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish
the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
 
Based solely on the Company’s review
of the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, and written representations that no other
reports were required, the Company believes that no person who, at any time during such fiscal year, was a director, officer or
beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Company’s common stock failed to comply with all Section 16(a) filing requirements
during such fiscal years.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Board of Directors
and
Stockholders of AFH Acquisition VII
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of AFH Acquisition VII, Inc. as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements
of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended October 31, 2014. . AFH
Acquisition VII’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AFH
Acquisition VII as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in
the two year period ended October 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has had no revenues and income since inception. These conditions, among others,
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these
matters are also described in Note D, which includes the raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity.
The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note
1 -	The Company
AFH Acquisition
VII, Inc., a development stage company (the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
September 24, 2007. The Company is 57.84% owned by AFH Holding & Advisory, LLC (the “Parent”). The financial statements
presented represent only those transactions of AFH Acquisition VII, Inc. The Company is looking to acquire an existing company
or acquire the technology to begin operations.
 
As a blank
check company, the Company’s business is to pursue a business combination 	through acquisition, or merger with, an existing
company.
 
Since inception,
the Company has been engaged in organization efforts and as set forth below has entered into an LOI.
 
On October
5, 2012, AFH Holding & Advisory, LLC (“AFH Advisory”), a major shareholder of the Company, entered into a letter
of intent (the “LOI”) with two target companies, Eurocar, Inc. (“Eurocar”) and Park Place Motors Ltd. (“Park
Place,” together with Eurocar, the “Target Companies”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire the Target
Companies through a series of transactions including a merger or other business combination pursuant to which the Company would
cease to be a shell company, as defined in the rules of the SEC (the “Reverse Merger”).
 
On October
26, 2012, AFH Advisory, Eurocar and Park Place entered into an amendment to the LOI, pursuant to which the parties to the LOI agreed
to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company post Reverse Merger. On January 28, 2013, the parties
to the LOI entered into an Amended and Restated Letter of Intent (the “Amended and Restated LOI”), pursuant to which
the parties to the LOI agreed to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company post Reverse Merger,
provided for certain acknowledgments regarding the proceeds of the Offering, amended a provision regarding a potential subsequent
financing and amended certain financial representations made by each of Eurocar and Park Place. On February 1, 2013, the parties
to the Amended and Restated LOI entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated LOI to revise, among other things, the beneficial
ownership of the Company post Reverse Merger. On May 20, 2013, the parties to the Amended and Restated LOI entered into a Second
Amended and Restated Letter of Intent (the “Second Amended and Restated LOI”).
 
The Letter of Intent contemplating
the potential business combination contained several and various covenants and milestones. During the period it was determined
that Park Place and Eurocar were unable to achieve certain covenants or milestones. After due consideration of the non-compliance,
the parties agreed that the proposed business combination be postponed until such time that the parties were able to achieve compliance
or the terms of the Letter of Intent containing the covenants and performance target be renegotiated.

Note
2 -	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Method of Accounting
The Company maintains its
books and prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents
include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months
or less. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions, which periodically may exceed federally insured
amounts. 
 
Loss per Common Share 
Loss per common share is computed
in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10, by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for each period. 
 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can differ from those
estimates. 
 
Organizational
Costs
Organizational costs represent
management, consulting, legal, accounting, and filing fees incurred to date in the formation of the company. Organizational costs
are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 720-15.
 
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income
taxes under the asset and liability method, wherein deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided
for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.
 
The Company's short-term and
long-term deferred tax liability is based on the calculation of the deferred taxes on the Company's unrealized gain on available-for-sale
securities using a 40% effective tax rate based on a 31% federal income tax rate (net of state tax deduction) combined with an
8.84% California state income tax rate. The Company recognizes a deferred tax asset (through changes in the valuation allowance)
for the exact amount of the deferred tax liability.  The classification of these deferred taxes is concurrent with the
classification of investments for which the unrealized gain is derived. For balance sheet presentation, current deferred tax assets
and liabilities have been offset and presented as a single amount and non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities within each
tax jurisdiction have been offset and presented as a single amount.
 
When tax returns are filed,
it is highly probable that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are
subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.  The
benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence,
management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of
appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.  Tax
positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.  The portion of the benefits
associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized
tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.  As
of October 31, 2014, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits, and the Company had no positions which, in the opinion of management,
would be reversed if challenged by a taxing authority. The Company’s evaluation of tax positions was performed for those
tax years which remain open to audit.  The Company may from time to time, be  assessed interest or penalties
by the taxing authorities, although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to the Company’s financial
results.  In the event the Company is assessed interest and/or penalties, such amounts will be classified as income tax
expense in the financial statements.

Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial
instruments consist of cash and due to parent. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company is not
exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial
instruments approximates their carrying value, unless otherwise noted.
 
Recent Pronouncements
On June 10, 2014,
the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development
stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from
U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder’s equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and
(4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the
development stage. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this accounting standard during the current period.
In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition
standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company
will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either
a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company currently has no revenues and
doesn’t expect any impact of adopting this guidance.
In June 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This ASU provides more
explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that
could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
impact on the financial statements.
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
“Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Topic 205-40)”, which requires management to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting
period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the adoption
of this accounting standard to determine what material impacts it may have on the financial statements and related disclosures.

of the Company’s common stock, which resulted in additional reverse merger expenses of $771,736. The shares were issued in
May 2013.
 
 
Note
8 – Reverse Merger Expenses

LOI (see Note A). $1,200,000 of such proceeds will be kept by the parent, AFH Holding & Advisory. The $1,200,000 has been reflected
as a consulting fee in the accompanying financial statements. The remaining proceeds from the Private Placement Finances will be
used for expenses incurred by AFH in connection with the Private Financing, the Business Combination and all related going public
expenses. The expenses incurred to date have been reflected under Reverse Merger Expenses in the accompanying financial statements
