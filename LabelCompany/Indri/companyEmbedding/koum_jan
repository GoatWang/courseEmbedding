The rags-to-riches story of WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum, who grew up without running water and is now worth over $9 billion

WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum.Reuters
Few people have¬†benefited from Facebook's incredible success more¬†than WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum.
With an estimated fortune of roughly¬†$9.5 billion, 41-year-old Koum¬†has come a long way from growing up without running water in Soviet-Era Ukraine to creating a messaging app used by¬†1.2 billion people.
Facebook purchased WhatsApp in 2014 for a jaw-dropping $19 billion, adding Koum to the company board and sending his net worth into the stratosphere.
Koum now leads a team of around 100 people working on WhatsApp, which is used heavily in developing countries like India and Brazil. And he sold over half of his shares in Facebook last year, totaling roughly $5 billion.
Here's how Koum got to where he is today:

Koum has an estimated net worth of roughly $9.5 billion. His fortune is made up almost entirely from Facebook stock, which he's been selling aggressively over the past year.

But Koum wasn't always wealthy. He was born in Ukraine in 1976 into a household without running water.
Shutterstock Source: Forbes





Here's how he described life in his hometown outside Kiev: "It was so run-down that our school didn't even have an inside bathroom. Imagine the Ukrainian winter, -20¬∞C, where little kids have to stroll across the parking lot to use the bathroom. Society was extremely closed off: you can read 1984, but living there was experiencing it."

After Koum turned 16, he and his mother immigrated to the United States, leaving behind their anti-Semitic and communist environment to wind up in a small apartment in Mountain View, California, where they lived on welfare and used food stamps.
Flickr / Paul Sableman





In high school, Koum taught himself about computers by buying manuals from a local store and then returning each one when he finished reading it.
Flickr / Lauri RantalaSource: Forbes





Although he was a self-confessed troublemaker in high school who "barely graduated," Koum enrolled at San Jose State University and started working for Ernst and Young as a security tester.
Associated PressSources: Forbes, LinkedIn





One thing Koum wishes he could erase from that part of his history is a restraining order from his ex-girlfriend. "I feel I was irrational and behaved badly after we broke up," Koum said in 2014. "I am ashamed of the way I acted, and ashamed that my behavior forced her to take legal action. I am deeply sorry for what I did."
David RamosSource: Bloomberg





While on assignment for Ernst and Young in 1997, Koum met early Yahoo employee Brian Acton. Six months later, Acton helped him get a security job there.
Brian Acton.Reuters





While at Yahoo, Koum joined an elite, security-focused hacker group called "w00w00," which included Napster's Shawn Fanning and dozens of other members. When a Canadian teen launched a massive denial-of-service attack on Yahoo, Koum called on the crew for advice and help.
Thomson ReutersSource: Reuters





Koum remained at Yahoo for nine years, rising to become manager of infrastructure engineering. But in 2007, he and Acton both left the company and spent some time traveling through South America.

When they returned, Koum and Acton applied to Facebook. Ironically, they were rejected.
Facebook





During their time off, Koum mulled over what he wanted to do next and came up with an idea for letting people set status updates on their phones. Koum incorporated WhatsApp on his birthday, February 24, in 2009. By that summer, he and Acton decided to morph the product into a messaging app.
TheWayBackMachine





And so it began. WhatsApp's first "office" was a couple of cubicles in the back of a converted warehouse shared by Evernote, where employees had to wrap blankets around themselves for warmth. Influenced by their time at Yahoo, Acton and Koum had a similar product philosophy: advertising sucks.

Koum and Acton also cared deeply about user privacy from the get-go. According to Koum: "We want to know as little about our users as possible... We're not advertisement-driven so we don't need personal databases."
Jan KoumSource: Wired





WhatsApp quickly started growing organically without any marketing or PR, especially in lesser developed countries that heavily relied on SMS texting.

In 2012, WhatsApp caught the attention of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who gave Koum a call. The two met for coffee and went on a hike.

Koum and Zuck stayed in touch, going on more hikes and talking shop about connecting the world. Fast-forward two years.
Reuters





In February 2014, Zuckerberg had Koum over for dinner and put an acquisition offer on the table. Koum thought about it for a couple of days and then came back to Zuck's house on Valentine's Day, interrupting his dinner with wife Priscilla. They hashed out terms over chocolate-covered strawberries.

The night before signing the final papers, Koum stayed up late going over everything with the team from the VC firm Sequoia, which had funded WhatsApp's Series A. Driving home at 2:30 a.m., Koum's tire blew out at 75 mph hour and he almost died.

The next day, in a somewhat symbolic move, Koum signed the paperwork for the Facebook acquisition on the door of his former welfare office. The office is just a few blocks away from WhatsApp's headquarters in Mountain View.

Suddenly, as of February 2014, Koum's stake in WhatsApp was worth $6.8 billion. His net worth would continue to surge along with Facebook's stock value.

Koum joined Facebook's board and agreed to a yearly base salary of $1 with stock options worth billions. He would continue to lead WhatsApp out of a nondescript office in Mountain View, miles away from Facebook's headquarters.

The WhatsApp team celebrated the Facebook deal by popping bottles of Cristal champagne. Igor Solomennikov, one of WhatsApp's first employees, posted this photo to Instagram, though he later took it down. A bottle of Cristal typically costs about $200.

Just days after the acquisition was announced, Koum and WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton jetted off to Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress. They took some time there to party. Koum celebrated the acquisition and his 38th birthday with a massive, paparazzi-filled party at a nightclub called Boujis.

But even though he's now worth billions, Koum has carried his money-saving ways into adulthood. He pressured Facebook to close the deal in time for his flight to Barcelona, which he couldn't change and had bought with frequent-flier miles.

Just months after WhatsApp was bought, Koum made a serious turn to philanthropy, quietly making a $556 million donation to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
APSource: SFGate





He also donated $1 million to the foundation responsible for the open-source operating system FreeBSD. "In a way, FreeBSD helped lift me out of poverty," Koum wrote at the time. "One of the main reasons I got a job at Yahoo is because they were using FreeBSD, and it was my operating system of choice."
FreeBSDSource: Facebook





Despite his wealth, Koum has maintained a low profile throughout his career. He claims that selling WhatsApp to Facebook only changed 10% of his life, and that he still lives in the same house and has the same friends.
ReutersSource: Medium





One of Koum's few indulgences is his love for Porsches. ‚ÄúFor me, a Porsche always represented the epitome of success," he said in 2016. "And the desire to have a car like that was a key incentive to learn more and to work even harder.‚Äù
ShutterstockSource: Porsche





Koum has been selling his Facebook shares at a rapid pace. He unloaded more than half of his holdings in 2016 alone, totaling roughly $5 billion. For comparison, Mark Zuckerberg sold roughly $1 billion in stock last year.
Facebook





When Facebook bought WhatsApp for a stunning $19 billion in 2014, the app had about 450 million monthly active users. Today, it has 1.2 billion.
Reuters





For now, Koum seems focused on growing WhatsApp around the world (the app's largest market is India). "At this moment, I am busy working on WhatsApp and I keep thinking all the time how I can make this product better," he said last year.

Celebrity7 Things to Know About Jan Koum, Founder of the $16 Billion WhatsApp  By Melissa LockerPosted on February 22, 2014 at 11:00am EDT 
ShareTweetEmail

AP



What‚Äôs WhatsApp?   
That was the question on everyone‚Äôs lips when Facebook announced earlier this week that it would pay at least $16 billion for the text messaging application, which has 450 million users around the world. The app does not sell advertising and has very little revenue, but offers Facebook even more access to the fast-growing world of instant messaging.   
The company was founded by Jan Koum, 38, who was relatively unknown outside of Silicon Valley circles until Facebook came calling. The low-key CEO gave very few media interviews as his messaging service quietly grew, on the grounds that press distracts from the actual product.   
Now that the product has sold for a staggering sum, all eyes are on the newly anointed hotshot CEO. Here are seven things to know about the newest tech titan:  
1. He was born and raised in a small village outside of Kiev, Ukraine.  According to a profile in Forbes, he is the only child of a housewife and a construction manager and grew up in a house with no hot water. At 16, he and his mother immigrated to Silicon Valley, where they struggled financially and lived on food stamps. His father died in 1997, his mother in 2000.  
2. As a teenager, Koum taught himself computer programming. He did it by purchasing used books and returning them to the store when he was done with them. He enrolled in San Jose State University, but dropped out when he got a job at Yahoo as an infrastructure engineer.   
3. He signed his deal with Facebook at the North County Social Services office. He used to collect food stamps there with his mother.

 4. In 2009, Koum wanted to give up. He wanted to pack WhatsApp in, but his friend and eventual co-founder, Brian Acton, talked him out of it. By early 2011, WhatsApp was in the top 20 of all apps in the U.S. iTunes App Store. By February 2013, WhatsApp had almost 200 million active users.   
5. Mark Zuckerberg had to court him. The Facebook CEO had his eye on WhatsApp for a long time and began wooing Koum early in 2012. Their long courtship included quiet dinners, long walks and coffee shop conversations.
6. Koum reportedly sealed the deal with Facebook over chocolate-covered strawberries. They were originally intended for Zuckerberg‚Äôs wife, Priscilla Chan, but Koum got them instead.   
7. His net worth is now around $6.8 billion. Forbes estimates that Koum owns approximately 45 percent of WhatsApp, which translates to him netting about $6.8 billion in the deal.

Jan Koum (Ukrainian: –Ø–Ω –ö—É–º; born February 24, 1976) is an American internet inventor[2] and computer programmer. He is the CEO and co-founder of WhatsApp (with Brian Acton), a mobile messaging application which was acquired by Facebook Inc. in February 2014 for US$19 billion.
In 2014, he entered the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans at position 62, with an estimated worth of more than seven and half billion dollars. He was the highest-ranked newcomer to the list that year.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Koum was born in Kiev, Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union). He is of Jewish origin.[4] He grew up in Fastiv, outside Kiev, and moved with his mother and grandmother to Mountain View, California in 1992,[5] where a social support program helped the family to get a small two-bedroom apartment,[6] at the age of 16. His father had intended to join the family later, but finally remained in Ukraine.[7] At first Koum's mother worked as a babysitter, while he himself worked as a cleaner at a grocery. By the age of 18 he became interested in programming. He enrolled at San Jose State University and simultaneously worked at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6]
In February 1996, a restraining order was granted against Koum in state court in San Jose, California. An ex-girlfriend detailed incidents in which she said Koum verbally and physically threatened her. In October 2014, Koum said about the restraining order, "I am ashamed of the way I acted, and ashamed that my behavior forced her to take legal action".[8]
In 1997, Jan Koum was hired by Yahoo as an infrastructure engineer, shortly after he met Brian Acton while working at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6] Over the next nine years, they worked at Yahoo. In September 2007 Koum and Acton left Yahoo and took a year off, traveling around South America and playing ultimate frisbee. Both applied, and failed, to work at Facebook. In January 2009, he bought an iPhone and realized that the then-seven-month-old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited his friend Alex Fishman and the two talked for hours about Koum's idea for an app over tea at Fishman's kitchen counter.[6] Koum almost immediately chose the name WhatsApp because it sounded like "what's up", and a week later on his birthday, February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California.[6]
WhatsApp became popular in just a short amount of time, and this caught Facebook's attention. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg first contacted Koum in the spring 2012. The two began meeting at a coffee shop in Los Altos, California, then began a series of dinners and walks in the hills above Silicon Valley. [9]
On February 9, 2014 Zuckerberg asked Koum to have dinner at his home, and formally proposed Koum a deal to join the Facebook board - 10 days later Facebook announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 Billion USD.[10][11][12][13][14]
Over the first half of 2016, Koum sold more than $2.4 billion worth of Facebook stock, which was about a half of his total holdings. He is estimated to still own another $2.4 billion in Facebook stock.[15]
His mother died in 2000 of cancer in the United States, while his father died in Ukraine in 1997.

Jan Koum (Ukrainian: –Ø–Ω –ö—É–º; born February 24, 1976) is an American internet inventor[2] and computer programmer. He is the CEO and co-founder of WhatsApp (with Brian Acton), a mobile messaging application which was acquired by Facebook Inc. in February 2014 for US$19 billion.
In 2014, he entered the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans at position 62, with an estimated worth of more than seven and half billion dollars. He was the highest-ranked newcomer to the list that year.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Koum was born in Kiev, Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union). He is of Jewish origin.[4] He grew up in Fastiv, outside Kiev, and moved with his mother and grandmother to Mountain View, California in 1992,[5] where a social support program helped the family to get a small two-bedroom apartment,[6] at the age of 16. His father had intended to join the family later, but finally remained in Ukraine.[7] At first Koum's mother worked as a babysitter, while he himself worked as a cleaner at a grocery. By the age of 18 he became interested in programming. He enrolled at San Jose State University and simultaneously worked at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6]
In February 1996, a restraining order was granted against Koum in state court in San Jose, California. An ex-girlfriend detailed incidents in which she said Koum verbally and physically threatened her. In October 2014, Koum said about the restraining order, "I am ashamed of the way I acted, and ashamed that my behavior forced her to take legal action".[8]
In 1997, Jan Koum was hired by Yahoo as an infrastructure engineer, shortly after he met Brian Acton while working at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6] Over the next nine years, they worked at Yahoo. In September 2007 Koum and Acton left Yahoo and took a year off, traveling around South America and playing ultimate frisbee. Both applied, and failed, to work at Facebook. In January 2009, he bought an iPhone and realized that the then-seven-month-old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited his friend Alex Fishman and the two talked for hours about Koum's idea for an app over tea at Fishman's kitchen counter.[6] Koum almost immediately chose the name WhatsApp because it sounded like "what's up", and a week later on his birthday, February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California.[6]
WhatsApp became popular in just a short amount of time, and this caught Facebook's attention. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg first contacted Koum in the spring 2012. The two began meeting at a coffee shop in Los Altos, California, then began a series of dinners and walks in the hills above Silicon Valley. [9]
On February 9, 2014 Zuckerberg asked Koum to have dinner at his home, and formally proposed Koum a deal to join the Facebook board - 10 days later Facebook announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 Billion USD.[10][11][12][13][14]
Over the first half of 2016, Koum sold more than $2.4 billion worth of Facebook stock, which was about a half of his total holdings. He is estimated to still own another $2.4 billion in Facebook stock.[15]
His mother died in 2000 of cancer in the United States, while his father died in Ukraine in 1997.

Game,
People,
Play

I grew up in Russia. We had a telephone line, but a load of our neighbours didn't. It became a shared resource for the whole apartment complex. People would come and knock on the door and ask to call their family in another city.

Life and career[edit]
Koum was born in Kiev, Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union). He is of Jewish origin.[4] He grew up in Fastiv, outside Kiev, and moved with his mother and grandmother to Mountain View, California in 1992,[5] where a social support program helped the family to get a small two-bedroom apartment,[6] at the age of 16. His father had intended to join the family later, but finally remained in Ukraine.[7] At first Koum's mother worked as a babysitter, while he himself worked as a cleaner at a grocery. By the age of 18 he became interested in programming. He enrolled at San Jose State University and simultaneously worked at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6]
In February 1996, a restraining order was granted against Koum in state court in San Jose, California. An ex-girlfriend detailed incidents in which she said Koum verbally and physically threatened her. In October 2014, Koum said about the restraining order, "I am ashamed of the way I acted, and ashamed that my behavior forced her to take legal action".[8]
In 1997, Jan Koum was hired by Yahoo as an infrastructure engineer, shortly after he met Brian Acton while working at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6] Over the next nine years, they worked at Yahoo. In September 2007 Koum and Acton left Yahoo and took a year off, traveling around South America and playing ultimate frisbee. Both applied, and failed, to work at Facebook. In January 2009, he bought an iPhone and realized that the then-seven-month-old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited his friend Alex Fishman and the two talked for hours about Koum's idea for an app over tea at Fishman's kitchen counter.[6] Koum almost immediately chose the name WhatsApp because it sounded like "what's up", and a week later on his birthday, February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California.[6]
WhatsApp became popular in just a short amount of time, and this caught Facebook's attention. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg first contacted Koum in the spring 2012. The two began meeting at a coffee shop in Los Altos, California, then began a series of dinners and walks in the hills above Silicon Valley. [9]
On February 9, 2014 Zuckerberg asked Koum to have dinner at his home, and formally proposed Koum a deal to join the Facebook board - 10 days later Facebook announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 Billion USD.[10][11][12][13][14]
Over the first half of 2016, Koum sold more than $2.4 billion worth of Facebook stock, which was about a half of his total holdings. He is estimated to still own another $2.4 billion in Facebook stock.[15]
His mother died in 2000 of cancer in the United States, while his father died in Ukraine in 1997.
Trivia[edit]
Jan Koum was part of a group of hackers called w00w00, where he met[6][16] the future founders of Napster, Shawn Fanning and Jordan Ritter.
In November 2014, Koum donated one million dollars to The FreeBSD Foundation, and close to $556 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) the same year.[17]

Jan Koum (Ukrainian: –Ø–Ω –ö—É–º; born February 24, 1976) is an American internet inventor[2] and computer programmer. He is the CEO and co-founder of WhatsApp (with Brian Acton), a mobile messaging application which was acquired by Facebook Inc. in February 2014 for US$19 billion.
In 2014, he entered the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans at position 62, with an estimated worth of more than seven and half billion dollars. He was the highest-ranked newcomer to the list that year.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Koum was born in Kiev, Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union). He is of Jewish origin.[4] He grew up in Fastiv, outside Kiev, and moved with his mother and grandmother to Mountain View, California in 1992,[5] where a social support program helped the family to get a small two-bedroom apartment,[6] at the age of 16. His father had intended to join the family later, but finally remained in Ukraine.[7] At first Koum's mother worked as a babysitter, while he himself worked as a cleaner at a grocery. By the age of 18 he became interested in programming. He enrolled at San Jose State University and simultaneously worked at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6]
In February 1996, a restraining order was granted against Koum in state court in San Jose, California. An ex-girlfriend detailed incidents in which she said Koum verbally and physically threatened her. In October 2014, Koum said about the restraining order, "I am ashamed of the way I acted, and ashamed that my behavior forced her to take legal action".[8]
In 1997, Jan Koum was hired by Yahoo as an infrastructure engineer, shortly after he met Brian Acton while working at Ernst & Young as a security tester.[6] Over the next nine years, they worked at Yahoo. In September 2007 Koum and Acton left Yahoo and took a year off, traveling around South America and playing ultimate frisbee. Both applied, and failed, to work at Facebook. In January 2009, he bought an iPhone and realized that the then-seven-month-old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited his friend Alex Fishman and the two talked for hours about Koum's idea for an app over tea at Fishman's kitchen counter.[6] Koum almost immediately chose the name WhatsApp because it sounded like "what's up", and a week later on his birthday, February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California.[6]
WhatsApp became popular in just a short amount of time, and this caught Facebook's attention. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg first contacted Koum in the spring 2012. The two began meeting at a coffee shop in Los Altos, California, then began a series of dinners and walks in the hills above Silicon Valley. [9]
On February 9, 2014 Zuckerberg asked Koum to have dinner at his home, and formally proposed Koum a deal to join the Facebook board - 10 days later Facebook announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 Billion USD.[10][11][12][13][14]
Over the first half of 2016, Koum sold more than $2.4 billion worth of Facebook stock, which was about a half of his total holdings. He is estimated to still own another $2.4 billion in Facebook stock.[15]
His mother died in 2000 of cancer in the United States, while his father died in Ukraine in 1997.
Trivia[edit]
Jan Koum was part of a group of hackers called w00w00, where he met[6][16] the future founders of Napster, Shawn Fanning and Jordan Ritter.
In November 2014, Koum donated one million dollars to The FreeBSD Foundation, and close to $556 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) the same year.[17]

Anybody can build a company and sell the company the next day. That doesn't make you special, it doesn't make you unique, it doesn't make you all that great.

At WhatsApp, our engineers spend all their time fixing bugs, adding new features and ironing out all the little intricacies in our task of bringing rich, affordable, reliable messaging to every phone in the world.

Jan Koum


Time,
Passion,

Jan Koum


Life,

We're not interested in bombarding our users with, 'Hey, play this game, play this game, play this game.' It gets annoying, it gets in the way of messaging, and it gets in the way of staying in touch with people who are important to you.
Jan Koum


Game,
People,
Play



















I only have one idea, that is WhatsApp, and I am going to continue to focus on that. I have no plans to build any other ideas.
Jan Koum


Focus,
I Am,

I grew up in Russia. We had a telephone line, but a load of our neighbours didn't. It became a shared resource for the whole apartment complex. People would come and knock on the door and ask to call their family in another city.
