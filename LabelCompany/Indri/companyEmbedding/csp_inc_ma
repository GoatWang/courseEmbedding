	CSP Inc. Reports Second-Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Results




	Lowell, MA, May 24, 2017 - CSP Inc. (NASDAQ: CSPI), a provider of IT solutions and high-performance Ethernet products for diverse applications, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 ended March 31, 2017.









	The Company also announced that its board of directors has voted to pay its quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share to shareholders of record June 1, 2017 payable June 15, 2017.




	    




	Management Comments




	“We are pleased to say that the second quarter results continue to demonstrate positive progress on our growth strategy,” said Chief Executive Officer Victor Dellovo. “Cross-selling efforts between our Technology Solution geographies, as well as across High Performance Products and Technology Solutions continue to gain traction. Our managed services pipeline, in the U.S. and Europe, is growing, and we are taking actions to capitalize on the rapidly growing global security market. From a financial perspective, second-quarter sales were down 6.7%, primarily due to the timing of shipments at our U.S. business in the Technology Solutions division. However, year over year growth was achieved across our U.K. and Germany Technology Solutions businesses.









	“In High Performance Products, product development is focused on solutions to assist companies in the protection of their most critical business data, as well as rapid incident response as a result of a cyber-attack. Our recently announced Myricom nVoy Solutions have received positive feedback from customers and industry analysts. In addition, our next-generation security products are already receiving accolades, which include CSPi’s selection as an Innovative Security Provider by Leading Lights. To support our increased focus on security, we are executing on initiatives in engineering, marketing and sales to strengthen HPP positioning as a security solutions provider. We received royalty revenues from two E-2D planes in the second quarter, and our expectation is to receive royalties from two planes in Q3 and one additional plane in the fourth quarter.









	“In Technology Solutions, strong performance in Germany and the U.K., was more than offset by weakness in the U.S. While timing of shipments affected revenues in the U.S., our managed services pipeline remains robust, we are closing managed services deals at a greater frequency and the recurring revenue stream is increasing. There is also great interest in the Myricom nVoy Solutions as part of our security managed service offerings. We are continuing to hire engineers in the U.S. to support future growth.









	“Looking forward, we are expecting solid performance in the third quarter on both the top and bottom lines given our backlog in both divisions and our cost-control efforts. Longer term, we are making very good progress against our strategic initiatives and are positioning CSPi to capitalize on many growth opportunities,” concluded Dellovo.















	Exhibit 99.1








	Financial Results




	For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, revenue was $25.3 million compared with $27.1 million in the second quarter a year ago.









	Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased to 22.5% from 23.3% for the prior-year period due to the reduction in margin on the Technology Solutions business from lower product margins.









	Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $428,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with net income of $503,000, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.




	 




	Cash and short-term investments decreased to $11.0 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from $13.1 million at year end primarily due to increased accounts receivable at the end of the quarter with extended terms combined with other changes in working capital.









	Conference Call Details




	CSPi Chief Executive Officer Victor Dellovo and Chief Financial Officer Gary W. Levine will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. (ET) Tomorrow (May 25) to review CSPi’s financial results and provide a business update.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other portions of this filing contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking information. You should review the "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing  Overview of Fiscal 2016 Results of Operations  Revenue increased by approximately $14.1 million, or 16%, to $103.4 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 versus $89.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015.  Our gross profit margin percentage increased overall, from 21% of revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 to 24% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.  We generated operating income of approximately $3.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.2 million of operating income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.  The following table details our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of sales for the fiscal years ended:   % % September 30, 2016 of sales September 30, 2015 of sales (Dollar amounts in thousands) Sales $ 103,367 100 % $ 89,306 100 % Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 78,326 76 % 70,119 79 % Engineering and development 2,984 3 % 2,826 3 % Selling, general and administrative 18,256 18 % 16,135 18 % Total costs and expenses 99,566 96 % 89,080 100 % Operating income 3,801 4 % 226 - % Other expense, net (201 ) - % (210 ) - % Income before income taxes 3,600 3 % 16 - % Income tax expense 996 1 % 226 - % Net income (loss) $ 2,604 3 % $ (210 ) - %  Revenues Revenue increased by approximately $14.1 million, or 16%, to $103.4 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 versus $89.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015. Our HPP segment revenue increased by approximately $2.4 million and our TS segment revenue increased by approximately $11.7 million. HPP segment revenue change by product line for the twelve months ended September 30 was as follows : (Dollar amounts in thousands) Increase 2016 2015 $ % Product $ 11,190 $ 9,894 $ 1,296 13 % Services 5,152 4,054 1,098 27 % Total $ 16,342 $ 13,948 $ 2,394 17 %  The HPP segment revenue increase of $2.4 million is attributed to: (i) $0.8 million in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to production of aircraft; (ii) $1.1 million of additional part shipments to support the production of high-speed processing boards; and (iii) $0.5 million of additional Myricom product revenue.  TS segment revenue change by product line for the twelve months ended September 30 was as follows:  (Dollar amounts in thousands) Increase 2016 2015 $ % Product $ 66,645 $ 56,553 $ 10,092 18 % Services 20,380 18,805 1,575 8 % Total $ 87,025 $ 75,358 $ 11,667 15 %  The TS segment revenue increases in our U.S. and U.K. divisions of $11.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in revenue in our German division. The U.S. division product and service revenues increased by $10.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and the increase of 2.5 million in U.K. revenues is primarily attributed to product revenues. The German division revenue decrease is the result of lower product revenues.  Our total revenues by geographic area based on the location to which the products were shipped or services rendered was as follows:   For the Twelve Months Ended September 30, Increase 2016 % 2015 % $ % Americas $ 71,115 69 % $ 58,433 66 % $ 12,682 22 % Europe 27,960 27 % 27,848 31 % 112 - % Asia 4,292 4 % 3,025 3 % 1,267 42 % Totals $ 103,367 100 % $ 89,306 100 % $ 14,061 16 %  Gross Margins Our gross margins increased by $5.9 million, or 3% of revenues, to $25.0 million in fiscal year 2016 as compared to gross margins of $19.2 million in fiscal year 2015. The following table summarizes gross margin ("GM") changes by segment for fiscal years 2016 and 2015: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2016 2015 Increase GM$ GM% GM$ GM% GM$ GM% HPP $ 10,111 62 % $ 7,949 57 % $ 2,162 5 % TS 14,930 17 % 11,238 15 % 3,692 2 % Total $ 25,041 24 % $ 19,187 21 % $ 5,854 3 %  The impact of product mix on gross margins within our HPP segment for the twelve months ended September 30 was as follows:  (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2016 2015 Increase GM$ GM% GM$ GM% GM$ GM% Product $ 5,072 45 % $ 3,985 40 % $ 1,087 5 % Services 5,039 98 % 3,964 98 % 1,075 - % Total $ 10,111 62 % $ 7,949 57 % $ 2,162 5 %  The increase in our HPP segment gross margins is primarily attributed to the impact of $4.3 million of royalties on high-speed processing boards for the equivalent of seven planes at approximately 100% gross margin in fiscal year 2016 as compared to $3.5 million of royalties on high-speed processing boards for the equivalent of six planes in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $1.1million in revenue at approximately 65% gross margin on product shipments and a gross margin increase of $0.7 million attributed to a favorable mix of Myricom product sales for the comparative period.  The impact of product mix within our TS segment on gross margins for the twelve months ended September 30 was as follows:   2016 2015 Increase GM$ GM% GM$ GM% GM$ GM% Product $ 9,224 14 % $ 6,984 12 % $ 2,240 2 % Services 5,706 28 % 4,254 23 % 1,452 5 % Total $ 14,930 17 % $ 11,238 15 % $ 3,692 2 %  For fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, the increase in our TS segment gross margins of $3.7 million resulted from a $3.7 million increase in our U.S. division that was the result of a favorable product mix and an increase in high gross margin service revenues. An increase in product revenues recognized by our U.K. division was mostly offset by an unfavorable product mix and a decrease in product revenues recognized by our German division mostly was offset by an increase in service revenue margins, which is primarily attributed to a favorable mix of service engagements that enabled higher utilization of internal resources, creating a net neutral effect on gross margins from the foreign divisions.  Engineering and Development Expenses The following table details our engineering and development expenses by operating segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: (Dollar amounts in thousands) For the Year ended September 30, % of % of 2016 Total 2015 Total $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase By Operating Segment: HPP $ 2,984 100 % $ 2,772 98 % $ 212 8 % TS - - % 54 2 % (54 ) - % Total $ 2,984 100 % $ 2,826 100 % $ 158 6 %  The increase in engineering and development expenses in the HPP segment resulted from the timing of expenditures and increases in payroll related to hiring additional engineers. The fiscal year 2016 expenses are primarily for Myricom engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of new products.  Selling, General and Administrative The following table details our selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense by operating segment for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: (Dollar amounts in thousands) For the Year ended September 30, % of % of 2016 Total 2015 Total $ Increase % Increase By Operating Segment: HPP $ 5,663 31 % $ 4,692 29 % $ 971 21 % TS 12,593 69 % 11,443 71 % 1,150 10 % Total $ 18,256 100 % $ 16,135 100 % $ 2,121 13 %  For fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, the HPP segment SG&A spending increase of $1.0 million is primarily attributed to increases of: $0.7 million in management bonuses, $0.2 million for salaries, wages and employee benefits, and $0.2 million of outside consulting expenses, partially offset by a net gain of $0.4 million on insurance proceeds from an officer life insurance policy and a $0.3 million decrease in the cash surrender value of the underlying officers life insurance policies. For fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, the TS segment SG&A spending increase of approximately $1.2 million is substantially the result of an increase in our U.S. division of $1.6 million primarily attributed to variable selling expenses and management bonuses, partially offset by spending decreases of $0.4 million and $0.1 million in our U.K. and German divisions, respectively. The spending decrease in Germany is primarily attributed to lower selling expenses and the decrease in the U.K. is attributed to lower administrative costs.  Other Income/Expenses The following table details our other income/expenses for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: (Dollar amounts in thousands) For the Year ended September 30, 2016 2015 Increase (Decrease) Interest expense $ (87 ) $ (84 ) $ (3 ) Interest income 7 9 (2 ) Foreign exchange loss (134 ) (172 ) 38 Other income, net 13 37 (24 ) Total other expense, net $ (201 ) $ (210 ) $ 9  Income Taxes  The Company recorded an income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million, which reflected an effective tax expense rate of 27.7% for the year ended September 30, 2016, which was lower than the statutory rate due in part to the tax benefit from research and development credits. For the year ended September 30, 2015, the income tax expense was approximately $0.2 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 1,414%. The significantly high effective tax rate was due to the Company having a small profit with no tax benefit recorded for the substantial loss in the U.K. due to the fact that a full valuation allowance is maintained against the deferred tax asset.  As of September 30, 2016, management assessed the positive and negative evidence in the U.S operations, and estimated that we will have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. Significant objective positive evidence included the cumulative profits that we realized in recent fiscal years. This evidence enhances our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth. Other factors that we considered are the likelihood for continued royalty income in future years, and our expectation that the TS segment will continue to be profitable in future years. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2016, we have concluded that our U.S. deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized. It should be noted however, that the amount of the deferred tax asset realized could be adjusted in future years, if estimates of taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced, or if there is objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses.  We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.K. deferred tax assets as we have experienced cumulative losses and do not have any indication that the operation will be profitable in the future to an extent that will allow us to utilize much of our net operating loss carryforwards. To the extent that actual experience deviates from our assumptions, our projections would be affected and hence our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may change.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which increased by approximately $1.9 million to $13.1 million as of September 30, 2016 from $11.2 million as of September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, cash equivalents totaled $0.5 million of this amount.  Significant sources of cash for the year ended September 30, 2016 included net income of approximately $2.6 million, an increase in deferred revenues of approximately $1.8 million, an increase in pension and retirement plans liabilities of $0.6 million, depreciation of approximately $0.6 million, and an increase in other assets of approximately 0.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $1.6 million, payment of dividends of approximately $1.7 million, purchases of property and equipment of approximately $0.7 million and unfavorable currency exchange fluctuation of approximately $0.8 million.  Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries located in Germany and the U.K. totaled approximately $6.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and $3.3 million as of September 30, 2015. This cash is included in our total cash and cash equivalents reported above. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested into these foreign locations because repatriating it would result in unfavorable tax consequences. Consequently, it is not available for activities that would require it to be repatriated to the U.S.  As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company maintained a line of credit that allows for borrowings of up to $1.0 million. Availability under the facility is reduced by outstanding borrowings thereunder. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings is London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus 2.5%, with a floor of 4%. Borrowings under the credit agreements are required to be repaid on demand in certain circumstances, upon termination of the agreements, or may be prepaid by the Company without penalty. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit during the fiscal years ending September 30, 2016 and 2015.  As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company also maintained an inventory line of credit that may be used by the TS segment in the U.S. to purchase inventory from approved vendors with payment terms which exceed those offered by the vendors. No interest accrues under the inventory line of credit when advances are paid within terms, late payments are subject to an interest charge of Prime plus 5%. The credit agreements for the inventory line of credit contain financial covenants which require the Company to maintain the following TS segment-specific financial ratios: (1) a minimum current ratio of 1.2, (2) tangible net worth of no less than $2.5 million, and (3) a maximum ratio of total liabilities to total net worth of less than 5.0:1. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, Company borrowings under the inventory line of credit were $3.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, and the Company was in compliance with all covenants.  For more information, please refer to Note 12 - Lines of Credit, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.  If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements, we may need to access funds through bank loans, the equity markets, or other means. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we may not be able to complete development or enhancement of products, take advantage of future opportunities, respond to competition or continue to effectively operate our business.  Based on our current plans and business conditions, management believes that the Company's available cash and cash equivalents, the cash generated from operations and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for the Company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangibles, income taxes, deferred compensation, revenue recognition, retirement plans, restructuring costs and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; valuation allowances, specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and net deferred tax asset valuation allowance; inventory valuation; intangibles; and pension and retirement plans.  Revenue Recognition  We derive revenue from the sale of integrated hardware and software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other services, and third party service contracts. Professional services generally include implementation, installation, and training services. Other services generally include revenue generated through our royalty and extended warranty contracts. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product or service has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into multiple element arrangements as well as standalone sales of product, professional services, and other services.  We recognize revenue from standalone product sales upon transfer of title, which is typically upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenue generated from standalone professional services and extended warranty contracts is recognized as services are performed, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In some instances professional service contracts include a customer acceptance provision, in which case revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance. We recognize revenue from usage based royalty contracts upon confirmation from the customer of shipment of the system produced pursuant to the royalty agreement.  We recognize revenue from multiple element arrangements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements. We evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine if separate units of accounting exist, and if so, we allocate revenue to each element based upon the relative selling price of each element. ASC 605-25 establishes a hierarchy for determining the amount to allocate to each separate deliverable in an arrangement. We determine selling price using vendor specific objective evidence  We recognize revenue from third party service contracts as either gross sales or net sales in accordance with ASC 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, which requires us to determine if the Company is acting as a principal party to the transaction or simply acting as an agent or broker. Under ASC 605-45, the assumption of the risks and rewards under the arrangement are considered indicators of principal parties to the arrangement. We record revenue as gross when it is a principal party to the arrangement and net of cost when we are acting as a broker or agent. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded in revenue and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in cost of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to revenue resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.  HPP Segment Revenue  HPP segment revenue is derived from the sale of integrated hardware and software, maintenance, and other services  through the Multicomputer and Myricom product lines. Multicomputer product revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped, provided that all revenue recognition criteria are met. Service revenue consists principally of warranty and royalty revenue. Revenue generated from extended warranty contracts is recognized as services are performed over the term of the contract, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met We recognize revenue from usage based royalty contracts upon confirmation from the customer of shipment of the system produced pursuant to the royalty agreement.  Myricom revenue is derived from the sale of products, which are comprised of both hardware and embedded software which is essential to the products functionality, and post contract maintenance and support. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with ASC 605-25. We evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine if separate units of accounting exist, and if so, we allocate revenue to each element based upon the relative selling price of each element. We determine selling price using BESP. Management's determination of BESP is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, internal costs and gross margin objectives. Accordingly revenue for post contract maintenance and support is recognized over the implied maintenance period of three years, and revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Customer Commitment






We provide the tools and the methodology that allows security architects to easily build a threat visibility and data capture network through a mix of hardware and software solutions. This gives our customers the ability to look into the data to verify what other tools may be indicating, while giving you full knowledge as to the type, breadth and severity of the threat.
Gary Southwell, General Manager, Ethernet Products






Our customers continually navigate a shifting IT landscape, seeking the best ways to architect and manage their computing environment.  With so many variables to oversee it is nearly impossible for them to both stay current technically and effectively maintain an existing infrastructure.  We are a partner who extends the customer team, providing today’s best technology solutions while also anticipating future needs.
Victor Dellovo, CEO & General Manager, IT Managed Services












Today’s security threats come in many forms and attack along multiple vectors, making asset protection and brand reputation a primary concern to our customers.    We are passionately committed to delivering the security they need, engaging with them to understand vulnerabilities and use our experts to craft the best solution from a portfolio of services.
Frank Putz, Managing Director, Security
