THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR FUTURE





Award-winning financial advisor Ric Edelman reveals how exponential technologies will alter virtually every aspect of your life — with profound implications for your personal finances.
Order NOW














The Future of Personal Finance Is Here:
Ric radically upends traditional financial planning, showing that you need not just one financial plan, but three — one for now, one for later and one for much later. You’ll learn:

Why you’re likely to live much longer, and enjoy good health much longer than you realize — and the impact on your financial future.
How you must alter your plans to shift from the familiar linear lifeline (school-job-retirement-death) to the new cyclical lifeline.


The importance of career planning — even if you’re in your 50s or 60s — and how to manage this transition without damaging your savings and investments or incurring debt.
The one investment strategy you need in the 21st century, including how to invest in companies that are leaders in exponential technologies and how to generate income from your investments.


Why nursing homes are becoming obsolete — and with them, long-term care insurance policies, and what this means for you.
How to deal with new complexities in estate planning — including the handling of such new issues as the protection of digital assets.


How you’ll spend your time — and money — in retirement, and why the future will be the happiest time of your life.

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.
3The RIABiz listing of the 10 most influential figures in the Registered Investment Advisor industry is in recognition of notable, driven and influential executives who are advancing their firms and are considered to be influential in the RIA business. Investor experience/returns were not considered as part of this ranking.
4Presented by the International Association of Registered Financial Consultants (IARFC). Candidates must hold a professional designation and must have disseminated their comments on financial topics by having them widely published in articles, journals, books, etc. They must have provided outstanding personal service or leadership in the financial services industry. Nominees must have participated in some aspect of financial education to the public or to other members of the profession. Investor experience/returns were not considered.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

We’re proud to be a part of the fastest-growing segment of the financial services industry.

Thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry with a fundamental belief: Independence is a better way. Today, our entire business is built to fuel the independent spirit of advisors., from your first steps toward establishing an independent firm through your tireless efforts to put clients first. We’re always looking out for what’s next and innovating on advisors’ behalf.

            “What does it really mean to be an RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) is an advisory firm that offers independent professional financial advice to clients with a range of investing goals and needs.
                  

                    Many RIAs are owned by the advisors who run them. They are not tied to specific funds or products and typically provide their services for a fee based on a percentage of client assets.

            “Is the RIA model the right fit for me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Not necessarily. Some advisors are comfortable where they are. Others aren’t ready to make the move.
                  

                    But if you have a vision for how you want to do business—and you like the idea of having more control over your future and more choices for how you serve your clients—then the RIA model could be ideally suited for you.
                  
To find out, take this short RIA self-assessment quiz.

            “What's the long-term viability of the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    While other channels (such as wirehouses and independent broker-dealers) shrink, the RIA model continues to grow year-over-year, a trend that shows no signs of slowing. 1, 2

            “Who regulates the RIA industry?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    RIAs are registered with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators. RIAs have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients as regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                  

                    For additional information on regulation and registering as an RIA, read At a Glance: Legal and Regulatory Considerations for Becoming an RIA.

            “What if I want the benefits of the RIA model, but I don’t want to own a firm?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You have more options to grow as an independent advisor than ever before. You may prefer the freedom to focus on your clients without dealing with the day-to-day operations. Solutions range from enlisting platform-provider support to joining an existing firm.
                  

                    Decide the best fit for you by reviewing the spectrum of independence.
                  

Read the Info Sheet >

















            “Why would I expect to earn more as an independent RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Advisors who own their business have the potential to net more than those in an employee model do—even when taking bonus payouts and other employee incentives into account.
                  

                    Starting and running a business is an investment, and there are certainly startup and ongoing expenses involved. However, as an owner, you have 100% control over how revenue is distributed—including how you reinvest in the firm.
                  

                    As an independent owner, you are also in the best position to maximize your income while laying the foundation for a potentially lucrative exit strategy.

            “How will the RIA model affect my access to products and services?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Many advisors explore the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) model because their current firm may limit the products and services they can offer their clients. With the RIA model, you get to choose the custodian that provides access to some of the best products and services to help suit the needs of your clients.
                  

                    “I wake up every day thinking about how [we] can be bigger and better.”—Neal Simon







                      Watch advisor Neal Simon discuss the freedom that choosing the RIA model gave him.
                    








            “Will my clients come with me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer
When clients think of your current firm, they think of you.

                    Industry research reports show that clients are loyal to their advisors, and nearly 80% of clients were immediately on board with the move.1


                    “It was seamless, and we had no complaints at all from any clients in this transition.”—Chris Baker

            “Can I keep my commission-based business?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    If commission-based business is part of your offer, you don’t need to give it up. The hybrid model lets you maintain both advisory and brokerage business. It also can enable you to offer clients a range of services and product solutions that complement their advisory philosophy.
                  

                    Learn more about whether the hybrid option is the right fit for you by reading Schwab’s platform for hybrid advisors.

            “Will I be able to choose my own technology?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Instead of working within the constraints of technology mandated by larger firms, you have the freedom to choose the solutions that are the right fit for your business and your clients.
                  

                    “One of the great things about the RIA model is you get to pick and choose the different technology packages that best fit your clients’ needs.”—Fran Hoey






                      Learn more about the benefits that advisor Fran Hoey experienced in choosing his firm’s technology.
                    















            “What kind of startup costs are involved?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Starting your own business is an investment—one that can involve everything from real estate and office setup to technology and marketing.
                  

                    The RIA Economic Discovery Tool can help you identify and track the capital needed to make your move. And financing options—like small-business loans—help make the initial costs more manageable.

            “What's involved in the transition, and how long does it take?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    No two transitions are exactly alike. For example, if you choose to join an existing firm rather than start your own, the process can be expedited.
                  

                    Whether you join or start your firm, the timing will depend on how quickly you want to make the move.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You built your client relationships on excellent service. As an independent advisor at an RIA firm, you should expect the same high level of support from your custodian.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    From assessing your current situation to formalizing partner agreements, you’ll want to dedicate sufficient time and thought into building a plan that helps establish—and safeguard—your firm.

                    “Advisors, when they’re looking to break away or leave their current employer, have to have a clear plan in place. They have to really understand where they are and where they’re headed to.”—Brian S. Hamburger

Going independent.



“Clients have to come before quotas.”


They do. Here’s why.
If I’m going to work for someone, it’s going to be my clients. By going independent, I truly felt I could put them first.
Brittany Albert, Lincoln Capital




“Our fear: Clients wouldn’t follow.”


They did. Here’s why.
The myth about going independent is that you can’t provide what your clients are used to. But we actually had more options and fewer constraints to help our clients achieve their goals than ever before.
Don Garman, Mirador Capital Partners




“We feared we’d have less to offer.”


We had more. Here’s why.
You hear about all the things you are limited to as an independent. But the opposite is true. We not only had access to more unique products, but we could offer them at lower prices.
Trevor Callan, Callan Capital








What it means to go independent.
More and more financial advisors are choosing to start their own independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firms or join one. By leaving the traditional wirehouse, RIAs gain the freedom and control to run their own business and provide the kind of service their clients expect. Here are some of the advantages:

Be your own boss and shape your business terms the way you want. 
Increase your income potential—as an RIA, you have 100% control of your payout.
Gain greater control over how you can market to and communicate with clients.
Access more technology options for scaling your business and creating your client experience.

Get more details. Download our in-depth white paper Exploring Independence   .









Now’s the time to make the move.
There has been strong growth in the independent model in recent years. The reason? Advisors are seeing greater opportunities for themselves and their clients. Technology is constantly improving. And there are more options for running a business and customizing the client experience. Most importantly, clients are seeing the value of putting more trust in independent RIAs.
As a result, the numbers speak for themselves.














Project your earning potential. Test different business scenarios using the RIA Economic Discovery Tool.









How to transition with as few obstacles as possible.
Starting or joining an RIA firm can be a big change, but it doesn’t have to be a difficult one. As the market leader and a champion of the independent advisor model, Schwab Advisor Services™ knows the steps to take and can help you make the transition to an RIA.

Video Transcript
We manage all of the assets of our firm in house. We have grown our business through family, friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such. 
Choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us. 
The day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue, the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job. 
Schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets. They really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients. 
Schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition. Transitioning a business is never easy, it’s never without stress. One of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance. When we moved to Schwab they had a team that came in, they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful. 
Communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected. They said, “Well do you really think it’s the right thing for me?” And we could say unequivocally yes. 
I have the ability to manage money any way that I see fit. 
Clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before. 
The clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had. Business owners respond to other business owners. Our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history. I consider this more than just a business, you know we consider it like a large extended family. 
It’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel. The ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine, you know if we do that. 
There’s tons of freedom being independent, um with the technology you have access to, you can work from anywhere and still get great results. 
So the fact that I can do my job wherever I need to be has allowed us to travel more, spend more time. I try to work from home 1 to 2 days, maybe 3 days a month. 
Because I now run my own business I have that freedom now to do what I think is best for me and my family. 
Don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and long-term, you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally. 
We don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile. 
Being independent isn’t for everybody, you have to have the right business mix but if you do, I think with the way the industry’s changing, you should look into it and you should probably look into it as soon as possible.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.

How to Break the Ice Around Family Finances

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Chapter 6
From Entrepreneurs to Civic Entrepreneurs

Introduction
My brother Mike and I never set out to become “civic entrepreneurs.” We did not see ourselves as being a part of the “open government” community. We were simply trying to solve a real-world problem, and that problem required improving the interfaces to government data. In this way, I think our story is the story of many civic entrepreneurs.
In the fall of 2007, we were young (Mike was 26, and I was 24), ambitious, and looking for a way to make an impact. We had just started an investment advisory company called Alfred Capital Management. We were managing money for individuals and families in San Diego and working hard to build the company client by client.
A few months prior, our father, Mike Alfred Sr., had introduced us to one of his clients, Dan Weeks, who was an engineering manager at Hewlett-Packard (HP). He had hired our father for some legal advice related to his real estate properties. Dan presented a business plan to Mike and me that attempted to solve a problem that he and his HP colleagues were struggling: building sound investment portfolios within their HP 401(k) plans. It was clear that Dan was incredibly passionate about 401(k) investing. Mike and I liked his engineering background, but we did not think the idea was viable at first.
Through a series of brainstorming sessions over the following weeks and months—most involving a few whiskeys—the possibility of working with Dan to improve retirement plans took on a new life. These sessions turned out to be where BrightScope began to take shape. We felt we had what could be a big idea. By individually rating every company retirement plan in the US, we believed we would drive an overall improvement in the ability of Americans to retire. It was an ambitious goal, the impact of which would reach far beyond our current client base—and that appealed to us.
Defined contribution (DC) plans are a relatively new addition to the corporate retirement plan landscape, rising out of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as an elective retirement savings program for employees. Originally DC plans were thought of as supplemental to company-sponsored, defined benefit (DB) pension plans, but over time, the DC plan firmly supplanted the DB plan as the primary retirement savings vehicle for American workers. As a result, there has been a major shift in retirement responsibility from employer to employee. In a DB plan, the company makes the contributions and the investment decisions, but in a DC plan, these two responsibilities fall squarely on the shoulders of employees. Unfortunately, most employees lack the discipline to save enough for retirement and the skill to build a well-diversified portfolio.
As we researched these structural issues, we uncovered other problems with DC plans. We found voluminous literature on high retirement plan fees, articles about conflicts of interest between plan service providers and plan participants, and a general feeling that DC plans were not being operated in the best interest of participants. At that point, we knew the opportunity was not solely helping participants make smart decisions for themselves, but also in defining what makes a DC plan good or bad, so that we could inspire the companies who sponsor the plans to make them better. Our objective of helping millions more retire in dignity was really a big data problem, and the first step was tracking down the right data.
The search for data quickly led us to the Department of Labor (DOL). Every retirement plan in the country files a Form 5500 annually with the DOL. Think of the Form 5500 as a tax form listing the assets, contributions, fees, and other details of each employee benefit plan. Larger plans, those with more than a hundred participants, are also required to obtain an annual audit. The combination of Form 5500 and the audit reports represented a gold mine of information, but first, we would need access to the data, which would require interfacing with the federal government.
The data we were looking for was not available through the DOL website. A few data companies were selling the 5500 data, but they did not have the additional high-value data from the audit reports. The decision was made to visit the DOL’s public disclosure room to ask for the data in person. At that point, we did what any entrepreneur would do in our position: wrote a business plan, raised a little bit of money from friends and family, and booked a flight to Washington, DC.
As it turned out, this was the beginning of our path to civic entrepreneurship with BrightScope. Though we never intended to build a business around “open data” and “open government,” that was precisely what we were about to do.
When “Public Disclosure” Is Not Enough
Showing up at the Department of Labor for the first time was definitely a culture shock. We had been to DC several times before, but mostly to visit the monuments as students. We had never been to DC “on business.”
I do not think you can overstate the difference between startup culture and federal government culture. Startups are all about speed—fast decisions and rapid development. In DC, you get a sense that everything happens slowly, and every decision is placed under the microscope. The professional staff at the DOL took their work very seriously, but they were held back by a lagging technology infrastructure and years of working through a slow bureaucracy to get work done.
We made our way through DOL security, and the staff directed us toward the public disclosure room. The public disclosure room itself is not much to speak of. It is a small, windowless room covered on two sides with bookcases filled with administrative staff manuals, advisory opinion letters, meeting minutes from advisory board meetings, and a whole host of other items that might be of interest to the public.
A desk lined the left wall upon entering. What appeared to be a 1990s-era IBM PC running a custom DOL version of MS-DOS sat on the desk. It was difficult to use and looked to be gathering dust. While this was the “public disclosure” room, we personally could not imagine many members of the public visiting the room, so the state of the computer did not surprise us.
By this point, Mike had realized that we would need to get some assistance from the DOL staff in order for this trip to be successful, so when an employee entered the room, he engaged him in casual conversation. Before long, both of us were standing behind the desk, looking over the staffer’s shoulder as he dug through the DOL database in search of the documents we described.
After thirty minutes of searching, we found what looked like an audited financial statement for the first company we had been looking for. After confirming that the document was in fact open to public inspection, we printed a copy. We repeated this process for ten to fifteen companies, so that we could ensure that the data was consistently available. We ended up leaving with audit reports from some of the companies with the largest retirement plans in the US, including IBM and HP, as well as some smaller companies that our friends worked at—Google and Facebook. We were informed that the reports would cost fifteen cents a page, which we agreed to, and left the DOL feeling buoyed by the fact that the data existed to accomplish our goals.
Our initial excitement about the data was quickly replaced by frustration. Upon returning to San Diego and working our way through the first fifteen plans, we did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation that with sixty thousand audit reports, an average of fifty pages per report, and a cost of fifteen cents per page, it would cost roughly 450,000 dollars to obtain the complete dataset for a single year. To top it off, the DOL clearly had no way to provide the reports to us in bulk, as evidenced by the manual way in which the DOL staffer had printed the first fifteen reports for us. There were also procedural hurdles. While the DOL instructed filers to avoid putting personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers, on the filings, they would occasionally still find filings with this information and have to redact them. While these redactions were rare, they still caused the DOL to create a policy of manually inspecting every printed page before providing the printed reports to the public.
With little to lose, we put together a list of the sixty thousand plans for which we needed data and filed a formal FOIA request. Within a few weeks, we found ourselves on a call with the DOL FOIA staff. We were told in no uncertain terms that our FOIA request was one of the most onerous requests they had ever received. In hindsight, given their limitations at the time, this assessment seems fair. However, when data is the only thing standing in the way of building a business, it is not what you want to hear.
We managed to work out a compromise with the DOL in which they would print out hundreds of audit reports at a time, put them into boxes, and ship them to us. It was not a sustainable system, but using that approach, we collected enough data to produce our ratings and launch our initial DC plan ratings to the public—and thus, our company BrightScope became a reality.
From Adversaries to Partners
If forced to select a single term to define our relationship with the DOL up through early 2009, the word “adversarial” would certainly be appropriate. We were asking for data that was nearly impossible for the DOL to deliver without some fundamental procedural change investment in technology, yet we would not accept no for an answer.
That status quo of shipping boxes was still in place at the time we launched our public website. After initially choosing a launch date of January 19, 2009, we were wisely counseled to push back a week so we would not get lost in the news cycle of incoming President Barack Obama, whose inauguration was set for January 20th. The administration change seemed irrelevant to our business at the time, but when President Obama made his first order of business the release of his Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, it grabbed our attention. The memorandum lacked formal teeth, but it was music to our ears:
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government. (Obama, 2009)
Our business had quickly become heavily dependent on gaining access to public data, but our progress was in fits and starts, surging ahead when a new box of data arrived and then flagging when data was delayed or did not come at all. Almost overnight, we felt a new tune coming out of Washington, a drumbeat of voices intent on making data open, transparent, and accessible, and we felt this could only be good news.
While some felt that Obama’s pledge did not cause any change, the DOL, to their credit, began to make steady progress in delivering on opening up their data. What started as the manual printing and mailing of documents transformed into the shipping of external hard drives with thousands of audits. This ultimately resulted in a bulk download utility that was accessible around the clock directly from the DOL website. We went from being constrained by data to having all of the data at our fingertips.
Meanwhile, our public ratings had begun to get serious traction. We received numerous write-ups in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and other mainstream media, and the traffic to our 401(k) ratings pages was on an upward arc. Starting with just eight hundred plans rated at launch, we had reached fifteen thousand plans by October and thirty thousand plans by the end of December. To process this volume of documents, we brought on new engineers and hired and trained a team of data analysts. Our team quickly expanded from fewer than ten at launch to thirty by the end of the year.
Our relationship with the DOL has transformed over the years. We have spent a tremendous amount of time with DOL staffers and political appointees, who have always taken time out of their busy schedules to meet with us when we are in town. The relationship was facilitated by open government events, which allowed for more casual interaction and discussion of big picture objectives.
In November of 2012, our relationship with the DOL truly came full circle. Impressed with the work we had done analyzing the audit reports, the DOL signed up as a BrightScope client and began leveraging the data for a variety of purposes. What started as a contentious relationship has turned into a true partnership, thanks to the DOL embracing an open approach to data.
Finding Comfort in Transparency
The changed relationship at the DOL is thanks to a combination of a mindset shift on the part of the department and an adoption of technology to solve a business process challenge. They became comfortable with more of their data being open to public inspection, and they started viewing companies like BrightScope as partners in their mandate of safeguarding retirement assets for participants. In some respects, the DOL’s new approach reminds me of the original description of the power of open government described in the influential paper “Government Data and the Invisible Hand” (Robinson, Yu, Zeller, & Felten, 2009). In the paper, the authors describe the limited role of government as requiring and enforcing appropriate disclosure, but stopping short of building interactive websites. This is instead focusing on opening up the data to the public so that the private market can engage with the data and ultimately drive its usage and interaction with the public:
In order for public data to benefit from the same innovation and dynamism that characterize private parties’ use of the internet, the federal government must reimagine its role as an information provider. Rather than struggling, as it currently does, to design sites that meet each end-user need, it should focus on creating a simple, reliable, and publicly accessible infrastructure that “exposes” the underlying data. (Robinson, Yu, Zeller, & Felten, 2009)
This way of thinking about government is not new, but it is a fundamental shift from how we traditionally think about government. Asking government to stay focused on data collection and distribution and leaving the building of websites and value-added tools on top of the data to the private sector might seem like chaos to some, but this approach has worked wonders, even within the private sector.
Open government thinker Tim O’Reilly (2010) describes this phenomenon as “government as a platform.” BrightScope’s plan ratings can be thought of as an “app” on a government platform, leveraging data from the DOL and SEC. Undoubtedly, firms like BrightScope and others will be able to build faster, take more risks, and combine the DOL’s data with third-party data in more new, interesting, and cost-effective ways than the DOL could themselves. So, it makes sense for the DOL to focus on platformizing itself and taking advantage of the entrepreneurial energy and innovations of the private market.
Defining Open Data
While BrightScope started with DOL data, as we have grown we have gathered data and information from a variety of public sources, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Census Bureau, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Through the process of identifying high-value datasets and integrating them into our databases, we have encountered all different types of public disclosure. At BrightScope, we are fond of saying that “public” is not a proxy for accessible, usable, or high-value. It is useful, therefore, to describe the best practices of how government agencies and departments currently disclose data and some of the issues their methodologies create. In addition, through this analysis, it is useful to have a common framework with which to evaluate the quality of the disclosure, both in terms of data openness and legal openness.
Technical Openness
When it comes to technical openness, our first belief is that releasing data in whatever state it is in is better than releasing no data at all. Startups have become remarkably adept at working with data and can usually develop processes to transform disclosed data into whatever form and format they need it in. That said, the lower the barrier to adoption, the more engagement you can generate around the data you are releasing.
The following framework comes from Cass Sunstein, President Obama’s regulatory czar, and the author of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness and Simpler: The Future of Government. In a memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on September 8, 2011, he describes a simple four-part test he uses to define “smart disclosure:”

Accessible: Free, online and in bulk
Machine-Readable
Standardized
Timely (Sunstein, 2009)


When we first started working with the DOL, the disclosure failed all four tests. The data was not accessible online; it was not available in machine-readable formats; it was not standardized; and it was certainly not timely due to a nearly two-year delay for processing. However, the new DOL disclosure satisfies two of the four requirements. It is available online, both file by file and in bulk for developers, and it is timely, being published within twenty-four to forty-eight hours of the disclosure being filed. The reports are not machine-readable, unfortunately, nor are they standardized, largely due to the fact that the reports are narrative attachments to a document (the Form 5500), so they still require processing. I would still give the DOL high marks for making the most of what they currently receive, though.
Legal Openness
Even once data is technically accessible, it must be open from a legal standpoint for it to be truly “open.” The “Open Definition,” as defined by the Open Knowledge Foundation, is perhaps the standard in defining legal “openness” as it relates to data and content. Their definition is simple:
A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it—subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike. (Open Knowledge Foundation)
Opening up data in this way, so that there are no limitations on use, reuse, and redistribution, can be tough to stomach for those with data. Some organizations with important consumer disclosures that they place on the web put strict legal limitations with how the information can be used. One example of this is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA operates BrokerCheck, a website that provides tools for consumers to research brokers and broker-dealers. The BrokerCheck website has a prominently placed legal notice making clear its “closed” legal stance:
The works of authorship contained in finra.org (the Site), ... may not be copied, reproduced, transmitted, displayed, performed, distributed, rented, sublicensed, uploaded, posted, framed, altered, stored for subsequent use, or otherwise used in whole or in part in any manner without FINRA’s prior written consent. (FINRA)
This legal language is against the spirit of open government. While the data is online and technically disclosed, it is not legally open and that distinction is important. It is certainly understandable for an organization like FINRA to have concerns about how their data will be used. Ensuring that data is correctly communicated to and interpreted by the public is an important goal, but if that was the only blocking issue, I think it could be overcome. I fear that organizations like FINRA do not open their data because they are concerned with the potential negative impact. As described by Gavin Newsom in his book Citizenville:
[Information] often ends up being used against them. Historically, people who request data or information aren’t doing it because they want to solve a problem or create a program. They’re often doing it for political purposes, as a kind of “gotcha government. (Newsom, 2013)
We in the open data community need to do a better job communicating why the benefits of releasing open data outweigh the potential negative effects. If we fail to make the case, some of the highest value datasets will either be legally closed or hidden from public view entirely, which would dramatically limit the potential of the open data movement.
Fortunately, I think many government agencies and departments have been able to clear this hurdle. The DOL undoubtedly had internal questions and concerns about the results of disclosing in a legally open fashion, but even with a small dose of engagement from the developer community, that disclosure has yielded huge benefits. Organizations that publish data under a closed license lose the opportunity to cut their costs and leverage the combined skills and abilities of web-savvy engineers and entrepreneurs all over the world.
Lowering the Barriers to the Next Generations of Civic Startups
At BrightScope, we spend a tremendous amount of time collecting, processing, and integrating the data we obtain from our government partners. We recognize, like most data companies, that data requires stewardship to ensure that the data quality is suitable for research, analysis, and public consumption. The challenge for a civic entrepreneur accessing data from the government is that, today, too much of their work lies in the behind-the-scenes discovery, cleansing, and matching across datasets and not enough in building the end tools for their users. By promoting data standards, we can ensure that the work we are doing as civic entrepreneurs and the money invested in our mission is funneled into the higher-value work of creating real tools for consumer decisions.
One example of this for BrightScope comes from the DOL filings. In order to calculate all of the fees consumers are paying within their 401(k) plans, we need to include the hard-dollar fees found directly in the Form 5500, as well as the fees coming from the plan’s investment options. This combination of administrative and investment fees becomes what we call “Total Plan Cost.” Fortunately, the investment lineup is contained in the audited financial statement. While the audited financial statement provides a list of investment options, it only requires the name of the investment and not an identification number for it. This makes it impossible to directly link the fund to data on mutual funds that is collected and disclosed by the SEC. As a result, BrightScope spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year parsing out the fund names from the audited financial statement, matching the names to the correct SEC fund ID, and pulling in SEC fund fee data so we can effectively calculate each plan’s Total Plan Cost. Each additional data transformation we make opens the door to introducing errors into our database. If the DOL were to simply require plans to file a standardized schedule of assets with the SEC fund ID, then BrightScope could take the hundreds of thousands of dollars we invest in our current process and invest it higher up the value chain instead. Across the federal government, there are literally thousands of examples where a lack of coordination across agencies and departments leads to lost opportunities to make mash-ups of government data tremendously easier for entrepreneurs.
A more prominent example of this phenomenon is all the data released every year across state and federal governments about individual companies. Information about their earnings is available from the SEC; information about their retirement plans are available from the DOL; information about their lobbying activity is available from the Senate Office of Public Records; information about their environmental record is available from the Environmental Protection Agency; and information about federal contracts they have won is available from the General Services Administration. Yet, there is no easy way to link all of these datasets together.
This is actually a broader issue that came to light during the financial crises, in which the debt of failing institutions was hard to track down, and thus, it was difficult for companies to gauge their “counterparty risk.” This difficulty—and the rapidly declining risk tolerance of the firms in question due to liquidity concerns—caused a freeze in the OTC derivatives and, ultimately, the credit markets in which banks and others refused to lend because of concern about their existing exposures. This issue has led to calls from industry for an international Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system in the financial markets. It is designed to handle the hierarchy problem—for example, it is estimated that AIG has over 250 operating subsidiaries and operations in 130 countries. The benefits of LEI are important:
The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) program is designed to create and apply a single, universal standard identifier to any organization or firm involved in a financial transaction internationally. Such an identifier for each legal entity would allow regulators to conduct more accurate analysis of global, systemically important financial institutions and their transactions with all counterparties across markets, products, and regions, allowing regulators to better identify concentrations and emerging risks. For risk managers in financial institutions, the LEI will increase the effectiveness of tools aggregating their exposures to counterparties. (The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, 2012)
While LEI is designed to solve a problem in the financial markets, it may also serve the open government community, provided it is either adopted throughout the government or utilities are built that provide mapping from the codes of each individual branch of government to the LEI. This is also not the only approach. Open government advocates, like Beth Noveck (a founder of ORGPedia) and the Sunlight Foundation, have taken the lead on advocating for a better approach, but there is still much work to be done.
Creating open source standards for identification and linking across datasets is not easy, but with every breakthrough, we lower the barriers to adoption of data for analysis and research. The benefits accrue to open data entrepreneurs and also to the very government agencies and departments tasked with regulating the companies, products, and industries that presently lack standards.
Closing Thoughts
While we did not think of ourselves as civic entrepreneurs when we started, our history is really a history of government as a platform and building a business on public data. When we first met and spoke with open government evangelists, like Tim O’Reilly, Jen Pahlka, Alex Howard, Beth Noveck, Laurel Ruma, and countless others, we began to realize how powerful an idea it truly was to provide entrepreneurs with data and access to government. BrightScope is proof that building a viable, for-profit business on top of government data can be a sustainable business model that both benefits government and provides enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs. Now, it is up to the open data community to work to lower the barriers to entry for future civic entrepreneurs.

THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR FUTURE





Award-winning financial advisor Ric Edelman reveals how exponential technologies will alter virtually every aspect of your life — with profound implications for your personal finances.
Order NOW














The Future of Personal Finance Is Here:
Ric radically upends traditional financial planning, showing that you need not just one financial plan, but three — one for now, one for later and one for much later. You’ll learn:

Why you’re likely to live much longer, and enjoy good health much longer than you realize — and the impact on your financial future.
How you must alter your plans to shift from the familiar linear lifeline (school-job-retirement-death) to the new cyclical lifeline.


The importance of career planning — even if you’re in your 50s or 60s — and how to manage this transition without damaging your savings and investments or incurring debt.
The one investment strategy you need in the 21st century, including how to invest in companies that are leaders in exponential technologies and how to generate income from your investments.


Why nursing homes are becoming obsolete — and with them, long-term care insurance policies, and what this means for you.
How to deal with new complexities in estate planning — including the handling of such new issues as the protection of digital assets.


How you’ll spend your time — and money — in retirement, and why the future will be the happiest time of your life.

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.
3The RIABiz listing of the 10 most influential figures in the Registered Investment Advisor industry is in recognition of notable, driven and influential executives who are advancing their firms and are considered to be influential in the RIA business. Investor experience/returns were not considered as part of this ranking.
4Presented by the International Association of Registered Financial Consultants (IARFC). Candidates must hold a professional designation and must have disseminated their comments on financial topics by having them widely published in articles, journals, books, etc. They must have provided outstanding personal service or leadership in the financial services industry. Nominees must have participated in some aspect of financial education to the public or to other members of the profession. Investor experience/returns were not considered.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

We’re proud to be a part of the fastest-growing segment of the financial services industry.

Thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry with a fundamental belief: Independence is a better way. Today, our entire business is built to fuel the independent spirit of advisors., from your first steps toward establishing an independent firm through your tireless efforts to put clients first. We’re always looking out for what’s next and innovating on advisors’ behalf.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) is an advisory firm that offers independent professional financial advice to clients with a range of investing goals and needs.
                  

                    Many RIAs are owned by the advisors who run them. They are not tied to specific funds or products and typically provide their services for a fee based on a percentage of client assets.

            “Is the RIA model the right fit for me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Not necessarily. Some advisors are comfortable where they are. Others aren’t ready to make the move.
                  

                    But if you have a vision for how you want to do business—and you like the idea of having more control over your future and more choices for how you serve your clients—then the RIA model could be ideally suited for you.
                  
To find out, take this short RIA self-assessment quiz.

            “What's the long-term viability of the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    While other channels (such as wirehouses and independent broker-dealers) shrink, the RIA model continues to grow year-over-year, a trend that shows no signs of slowing. 1, 2

            “Who regulates the RIA industry?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    RIAs are registered with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators. RIAs have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients as regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                  

                    For additional information on regulation and registering as an RIA, read At a Glance: Legal and Regulatory Considerations for Becoming an RIA.

            “What if I want the benefits of the RIA model, but I don’t want to own a firm?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You have more options to grow as an independent advisor than ever before. You may prefer the freedom to focus on your clients without dealing with the day-to-day operations. Solutions range from enlisting platform-provider support to joining an existing firm.
                  

                    Decide the best fit for you by reviewing the spectrum of independence.

            “Why would I expect to earn more as an independent RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Advisors who own their business have the potential to net more than those in an employee model do—even when taking bonus payouts and other employee incentives into account.
                  

                    Starting and running a business is an investment, and there are certainly startup and ongoing expenses involved. However, as an owner, you have 100% control over how revenue is distributed—including how you reinvest in the firm.
                  

                    As an independent owner, you are also in the best position to maximize your income while laying the foundation for a potentially lucrative exit strategy.

            “How will the RIA model affect my access to products and services?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Many advisors explore the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) model because their current firm may limit the products and services they can offer their clients. With the RIA model, you get to choose the custodian that provides access to some of the best products and services to help suit the needs of your clients.
                  

                    “I wake up every day thinking about how [we] can be bigger and better.”—Neal Simon







                      Watch advisor Neal Simon discuss the freedom that choosing the RIA model gave him.
                    








            “Will my clients come with me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer
When clients think of your current firm, they think of you.

                    Industry research reports show that clients are loyal to their advisors, and nearly 80% of clients were immediately on board with the move.1


                    “It was seamless, and we had no complaints at all from any clients in this transition.”—Chris Baker

            “Can I keep my commission-based business?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    If commission-based business is part of your offer, you don’t need to give it up. The hybrid model lets you maintain both advisory and brokerage business. It also can enable you to offer clients a range of services and product solutions that complement their advisory philosophy.
                  

                    Learn more about whether the hybrid option is the right fit for you by reading Schwab’s platform for hybrid advisors.

            “Will I be able to choose my own technology?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Instead of working within the constraints of technology mandated by larger firms, you have the freedom to choose the solutions that are the right fit for your business and your clients.
                  

                    “One of the great things about the RIA model is you get to pick and choose the different technology packages that best fit your clients’ needs.”—Fran Hoey






                      Learn more about the benefits that advisor Fran Hoey experienced in choosing his firm’s technology.
                    















            “What kind of startup costs are involved?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Starting your own business is an investment—one that can involve everything from real estate and office setup to technology and marketing.
                  

                    The RIA Economic Discovery Tool can help you identify and track the capital needed to make your move. And financing options—like small-business loans—help make the initial costs more manageable.

            “What's involved in the transition, and how long does it take?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    No two transitions are exactly alike. For example, if you choose to join an existing firm rather than start your own, the process can be expedited.
                  

                    Whether you join or start your firm, the timing will depend on how quickly you want to make the move.

            “What kind of ongoing service and support can I expect?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You built your client relationships on excellent service. As an independent advisor at an RIA firm, you should expect the same high level of support from your custodian.
                  

                    With Schwab, you’ll have dedicated service and support teams to help you with firm operations and business growth, plus access to best practices, industry events, and many other resources.

            “What are the legal and regulatory considerations of transitioning to the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    From assessing your current situation to formalizing partner agreements, you’ll want to dedicate sufficient time and thought into building a plan that helps establish—and safeguard—your firm.
                  

                    A Schwab Advisor Services™ Business Development Officer can introduce you to legal and compliance experts to help you build that plan for long-term success.
                  

                    “Advisors, when they’re looking to break away or leave their current employer, have to have a clear plan in place. They have to really understand where they are and where they’re headed to.”—Brian S. Hamburger

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
