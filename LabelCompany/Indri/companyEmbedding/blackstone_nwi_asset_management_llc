Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

The capital we deploy on behalf of our investors fuels the development of businesses and communities. The investments we make are the wellsprings of future opportunity. Through this work, we seek to ensure a secure retirement for millions. 


DIVERSE AND Global  The solutions we provide reflect insights generated by our diverse, global business platform, which encompasses private equity and real estate funds, hedge fund solutions, and credit funds.

Our People

The deep expertise of the Blackstone team gives us a base of intellectual capital on which to draw.

 $371billion
Assets Under Management
*As of June 30, 2017




“ “Blackstone has always been managed with a perspective of achieving successful growth over the long-term… Our management has consistently sought to focus on the best outcomes for our businesses and investments over a period of years rather than on the short-term impact.”   - Blackstone Prospectus, June 2007   













In 1985 Blackstone opened its doors with a staff of four, including the two founders, Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman, and a balance sheet of $400,000. From these early beginnings, besides big dreams, the founders have held these core beliefs:
     1   In an environment of ever larger firms, the most gifted would desire a more personal setting and would join Blackstone to create exciting new businesses in their fields of expertise.
            2   In a world of giant organizations    with a broad array of services, there was room for a specialized firm with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity, and senior-level attention to clients and relationships.        3   In contrast to the prevailing philosophy  of “other people’s money,” the firm would always put significant amounts of its own money in the investments it made.
            4   We will consistently strive to achieve  superior performance through innovation, uniqueness and excellence.        5  Above all else our people — their creativity,   imagination, dedication, teamwork and integrity — will be our key assets.

 30years




 Today, 30 years since the founding of the firm, we still run the firm in the same way. 
 
That means thinking about the implications of every decision – from investments to growth initiatives, risk management to team building – in terms of years and decades rather than just months or quarters.






 





Leadership
We believe that intellectual capital is critical to providing innovative solutions and, ultimately, having a positive economic impact.
Over the years, we have been fortunate to attract some of the most talented professionals in our industry. Our people are our most valuable asset – they are skilled problem solvers that believe challenges can be opportunities.
The extensive experience, talent and accomplishments of the Blackstone team give us a base of intellectual capital that is second to none.

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
