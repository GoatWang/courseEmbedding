CDK Global, Inc. Key Developments

CDK to Offer Dealers More Open and Inclusive DMS Platform
Jul 11 17
CDK Global’s International business revealed plans for an evolution of its dealer management platform that will enable automotive retailers to manage the customer journey from online to offline more efficiently and profitably. Building on CDK’s market-leading position, a new programme of openness in platform development will allow selected third-party applications to integrate with CDK’s core dealer management platform and better enable end-to-end automotive commerce. The new move coincides with the launch of a rapid product development programme, which will enable CDK to deliver new innovations to global markets. This approach will see CDK research and development teams work more closely with retailers, partners and consumers to identify issues, explore new efficiencies and develop new products and services. Examples of recent innovations include integration between CitNow, a video capture product to increase transparency and trust in the aftersales process and the DMS, but also new products such as SmartPay in Demark, a mobile payment solution for service departments. Through its existing partnership programmes with manufacturers, CDK has already developed and released a proven suite of interfaces that allow access to multiple-systems and network-wide information within its integrated Autoline Drive DMS software. The two-way sharing of vehicle and other data between retailers and vehicle manufacturers is that has the potential to free-up thousands of hours for dealership staff and improve the customer experience. For example, a short code can be generated from a selected manufacturer’s online car configurator, using factory build data for exact specifications, which can then be used in dealership processes and throughout the ownership cycle. Now, as part of CDK’s product evolution programme, retailers will have the option of integrating partner applications with the core DMS platform. Whether it is a vehicle manufacturer-mandated showroom system, dedicated CRM software or a marketing tool, CDK’s new approach will enable selected systems to integrate with the DMS platform and communicate with each other.


PSA Benelux and CDK Global Sign New Agreement to Enhance Peugeot and Citroën Dealer Management Systems
Jun 29 17
CDK Global and PSA Benelux have signed a new partnership agreement that offers the region’s Peugeot and Citroën dealers access to CDK Global’s new integrated Dealer Management System Autoline Drive. The move by PSA to enhance DMS provision across its network is part of the ‘ic@n framework’ 'PSA’s streamlining of its dealer management systems' to deliver greater efficiency and consistency across its retail network. Peugeot and Citroën dealers in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg will be the first outside France that can opt for the new system. The new system is licenced to retailers via a ‘Software as a Service’ (SaaS) model. This enables retailers to manage costs effectively, while ensuring the DMS system is always fully up-to-date. By being hosted centrally, retailers benefit from regular updates to the product to ensure it keeps up with changing trends and can offer new functionality as the market develops. The PSA network in Benelux will also be at the forefront of technological developments as Autoline Drive is designed to work across desktop and mobile devices. Autoline Drive is a powerful management tool built around a new accounting and financial suite that is totally integrated and offers the dealers a 360-degree view of their businesses in real time. PSA selected CDK Global’s system as one of the three choices for dealers, following the streamlining of software providers to enhance usability and simplify operations for its retailer network. The first dealers in Benelux will begin piloting the new Autoline Drive systems this year.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 2.51 M     Change from Last  3.80%      Percent of Float 1.73%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
