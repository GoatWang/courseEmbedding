Acorda Announces Positive Phase 3 Clinical Trial Results for CVT-301


02/09/2017

Download this Press Release (PDF)




        SPAN-PD trial met primary endpoint: CVT-301 showed statistically
        significant improvement of motor function compared to placebo
      

        New Drug Application (NDA) submission planned for Q2 2017
      

        Data from two long-term safety studies expected in Q1 2017
      

 ARDSLEY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACOR)
      today announced Phase 3 clinical data of CVT-301, showing a
      statistically significant improvement in motor function in people with
      Parkinson’s disease experiencing OFF periods. CVT-301 is an
      investigational, inhalable formulation of levodopa (L-dopa). It is being
      studied as a treatment for OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s
      disease taking an oral carbidopa / levodopa regimen. OFF periods refer
      to the re-emergence of Parkinson’s symptoms.
    

      “We are greatly encouraged by the efficacy and safety results of this
      trial, which validate the positive Phase 2b results,” said Burkhard
      Blank, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Acorda. “We would like to express
      our gratitude to the study volunteers and clinical investigators who
      participated in this trial to advance our understanding of this
      potentially important therapy for people with Parkinson’s.”
    

      The SPAN-PD trial had three arms: CVT-301 84 mg and 60 mg doses
      (equivalent to 50 mg and 35 mg fine particle doses, respectively), and
      placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was the change at Week 12 in
      Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part 3 (UPDRS III) score
      relative to placebo at 30 minutes post-treatment for the 84 mg dose.
      UPDRS III change for the 84 mg dose was -9.83 compared to -5.91 for
      placebo (p=0.009). UPDRS III is a validated scale, which measures
      Parkinson’s motor impairment.
    

      The safety profile of CVT-301 in this study was consistent with that
      observed in the Phase 2b trial. Spirometry and diffusing capacity of the
      lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) tests showed no notable
      pulmonary safety signals. The Company is currently conducting two
      studies to assess the long-term safety profile of CVT-301. Up to
      12-month data from these studies are expected by the end of the first
      quarter of 2017.
    

      The Company plans to file a New Drug Application (NDA) in the United
      States by the end of the second quarter of 2017, pending results of the
      long-term safety studies. The Company also plans to file a Marketing
      Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe by the end of 2017, pending
      additional data analyses.
    

Peter LeWitt, M.D., M.Med.Sc., Director of the PD and Movement Disorders
      Program at Henry Ford Hospital and lead investigator of the study said,
      “The re-emergence of Parkinson’s disease symptoms has a major negative
      impact on the lives of people with this disease, as well as on their
      families and care partners. Managing symptoms of OFF periods continues
      to be a significant unmet need for people taking oral carbidopa/levodopa
      regimens. Delivering levodopa by the pulmonary route offers an important
      treatment option for people with Parkinson’s disease.”
    

      Detailed trial results will be presented at a future medical meeting.
    

SPAN-PD Safety Findings


      Participants reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) were as follows: 3
      (2.7%) in the placebo arm, 6 (5.3%) in the 60 mg arm, and 2 (1.8%) in
      the 84 mg arm. There was one death in the study, a suicide in the 60 mg
      group, judged by the investigator to be not related to study drug.
    

      The most common adverse events that were reported in any study arm at
      >5% were:

      When cough was reported, it was typically mild and reported once per
      participant during the course of treatment. Three of 227 participants
      receiving CVT-301 discontinued the study due to cough.
    

SPAN-PD Trial Design


      The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of CVT-301 compared with placebo in
      people with Parkinson’s who experience motor fluctuations (OFF periods).
      All participants were on a stable regimen of oral carbidopa / levodopa,
      and were also maintained on their other existing Parkinson’s therapies.
      A total of 339 study participants were randomized and received at least
      one dose of CVT-301 or placebo. Participants self-administered treatment
      up to five times daily for 12 weeks.
    

      The primary endpoint of the study was the change at Week 12 in Unified
      Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part 3 (UPDRS III) score relative to
      placebo at 30 minutes post-treatment for the 84 mg dose. Key secondary
      endpoints, measured at Week 12, included: proportion of participants
      achieving an ON state within 60 minutes of treatment and maintained at
      60 minutes; change in UPDRS III score at 10 and 20 minutes following
      treatment; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) improvement; and
      total daily OFF time as recorded in participant diary.
    

About Parkinson’s Disease and OFF Periods


      Approximately one million people in the U.S. and 1.2 million Europeans
      are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD); OFF periods are experienced
      by approximately 350,000 in the U.S. and 420,000 in Europe.
    

      Parkinson’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from
      the gradual loss of certain neurons responsible for producing dopamine.
      It causes a range of symptoms including impaired movement, muscle
      stiffness and tremors. As PD progresses, people with Parkinson’s
      experience OFF periods, which are characterized by the re-emergence of
      PD symptoms. This re-emergence can occur even when an individual’s
      treatment regimen has been optimized.
    

      OFF periods can be very disruptive to the lives of people with
      Parkinson’s, their families and caregivers. OFF periods can increase in
      frequency and severity during the course of the disease.
    

About CVT-301 and ARCUS®


      CVT-301 is being developed as a self-administered, inhaled levodopa
      (L-dopa) therapy for the treatment of symptoms of OFF periods in people
      with Parkinson’s disease taking an oral carbidopa / levodopa regimen.
    

      CVT-301 utilizes Acorda’s investigational ARCUS® platform for
      inhaled therapeutics. CVT-301 delivers a precise dose of a dry powder
      formulation of L-dopa to the lung. Oral medication can be associated
      with slow and variable onset of action, as the medicine is absorbed
      through the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract before reaching the
      brain. Inhaled treatments enter the body through the lungs and reach the
      brain shortly thereafter, bypassing the digestive system.

Forward-Looking Statement


      This press release includes forward-looking statements. All statements,
      other than statements of historical facts, regarding management's
      expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects should be considered
      forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
      that could cause actual results to differ materially, including: the
      ability to complete the Biotie transaction on a timely basis; the
      ability to realize the benefits anticipated from the Biotie and Civitas
      transactions, among other reasons because acquired development programs
      are generally subject to all the risks inherent in the drug development
      process and our knowledge of the risks specifically relevant to acquired
      programs generally improves over time; the ability to successfully
      integrate Biotie’s operations and Civitas’ operations, respectively,
      into our operations; we may need to raise additional funds to finance
      our expanded operations and may not be able to do so on acceptable
      terms; our ability to successfully market and sell Ampyra
      (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg in the U.S.; third party
      payers (including governmental agencies) may not reimburse for the use
      of Ampyra or our other products at acceptable rates or at all and may
      impose restrictive prior authorization requirements that limit or block
      prescriptions; the risk of unfavorable results from future studies of
      Ampyra or from our other research and development programs, including
      CVT-301 or any other acquired or in-licensed programs; we may not be
      able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or
      successfully market CVT-301, any other products under development, or
      the products that we will acquire when we complete the Biotie
      transaction; the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products;
      delays in obtaining or failure to obtain and maintain regulatory
      approval of or to successfully market Fampyra outside of the U.S. and
      our dependence on our collaborator Biogen in connection therewith;
      competition; failure to protect our intellectual property, to defend
      against the intellectual property claims of others or to obtain third
      party intellectual property licenses needed for the commercialization of
      our products; and failure to comply with regulatory requirements could
      result in adverse action by regulatory agencies.
    

      These and other risks are described in greater detail in our filings
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may not actually achieve
      the goals or plans described in our forward-looking statements, and
      investors should not place undue reliance on these statements.
      Forward-looking statements made in this press release are made only as
      of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update
      any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring
      after the date of this press release.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
In September 2014 the company acquired Civitas Therapeutics for $525 million - gaining the Phase III Parkinson’s drug, CVT-301.[4]
In January 2016, the company acquired Finnish pharmaceutical company, Biotie Therapies, for $363 million. This gave the company control over Biotes sclerosing cholangitis drug, BTT1023.[5]
In November 2016, Acorda Therapeutics announced it was discontinuing development of dalfampridine, a drug intended for post-stroke walking difficulties, after a clinical trial failure. The discontinuation of the drug caused Acorda's shares to drop as much as 13.2%. Acorda shares have dropped 50.2% since January 2016.[6]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of December 31, 2013[update], the members of the board of directors of Acorda Therapeutics were:[7] Ron Cohen, Barry Greene, Peder K. Jensen, John P. Kelley, Sandra Panem, Lorin J. Randall, Steven M. Rauscher, and Ian F. Smith.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
