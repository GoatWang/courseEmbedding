Product Details




                                Jonathan Product Root Touch Up is a unique tube that dispenses loose, colored mineral powder through the built-in brush bristles to hide hair flaws including gray hairs, bald spots and roots. The rich powder creates a natural, fuller and more even look to blend perfectly with your hair color and minimize the appearance of bald spots and thinning hair. Great for use for on-the-go touch ups and to refresh hair in between washes.

Brunette is ideal for brown to medium brown hair.

Jonathan is a rare leader that understands both the tactical elements of marketing as well as the strategic aspects.  He demonstrates a keen understanding of the changing face of marketing as social media redefines the space and uses this understanding to drive necessary change.  I hope to never have to run a company without Jonathan as a part of my leadership team.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended JonathanGroups4Leaf PartnersMobile Marketing & AdvertisingMarketing Executives GroupAccount Manager Group - Sales Executives and ManagementTechnology Sales ProfessionalsSales Management ExecutivesDMA Membership GroupSee 7 moreChief Marketing Officer (CMO) Network - #1 Group for CMOsThe Sales AssociationFacebook Marketing & Advertising TipsSales and Marketing LeadersSales and Marketing AlignmentInside Sales ManagementSales Best PracticesSee lessView Jonathan’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Jonathan directlyView Jonathan’s Full ProfileNot the Jonathan you’re looking for?
