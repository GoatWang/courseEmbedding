To do this, we combine pressure-relieving memory foam and a springy, breathable top layer to create a sleep surface that leaves you feeling perfectly supported and practically weightless.ONE OF TIME’S 25 BEST INVENTIONS OF 20152017 MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIESBIG INNOVATION AWARD 2016Close up of the Casper MattressClose up of the Casper MattressTIRELESS IMPROVEMENTSince launch, we’ve continuously improved our mattress based on research, data, and feedback from our community of more than 400,000 customers. These updates include adding a fourth layer to increase pressure relief, developing proprietary foams for added durability and breathability, and creating a removable cover that’s easier to clean.8,109+25,000+700+Average star ratings based on listed sources. Updated 04/24/17See how we evaluate our productsOur R&D team uses three main methods to inform product improvements:USER TESTINGIn the beginning, we created beta models and invited friends and seasoned snoozers to A/B test them. We continue to enlist Casper customers to test improvements.DURABILITY TESTINGWe do feel testing, force profile testing, airflow testing, rebound testing, compression testing... well, you get the idea. Finally, we simulate 10 years of sleep to make sure it will last and last.RESEARCHOur dedicated research team conducts interviews and runs studies to understand sleep habits. These learnings help us make products that reflect real people’s needs.“Supremely comfortable”COOL BY DESIGNUnlike traditional memory foam mattresses, the Casper is designed to help you sleep cool. The open-cell top layer uses convection and conduction to flow heat away from your body. Similarly, the memory foam layer leverages airflow to pull heat out of the top layer, leaving you cool and comfortable.Why does heat flow matter?While you’re asleep, your body acts like a little thermal engine, putting out the equivalent heat of a 100W light bulb. By using foams that leverage convection (heat transfer through air) and conduction (heat transfer through solids), we’re able to pull heat away from your body, and disperse it back into the atmosphere.LESS STORES, MORE SNORESWe flipped the mattress industry on its head by eliminating showrooms, employing smart logistics, and using compression technology to ship the Casper mattress in a compact box. This allows us to offer a premium mattress for a fraction of the price.Red door with Casper Mattress boxRed door with Casper Mattress box“Changing the way people shop for mattresses”100 NIGHT TRIAL, FREE RETURN PICKUPSleep on it, lounge on it, dream on it — if you don't love it, we'll give you a full refund.

As with all foam beds, you want as much direct support under the mattress as possible. A wooden slatted or platform bed offers the most support. For optimal support under all size sizes ( twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, Cal king ) , we suggest using the Casper foundation.Why is the Casper mattress better than its lookalikes?The engineering behind the Casper mattress goes far beyond aesthetics. Our mattress is the result of intensive research and continuous development by our 30-person San Francisco R&D team, who collectively hold more than 50 patents. Unlike putting a cover over an off-the-shelf construction, our approach allows us to quickly respond to customer feedback and continually enhance our mattress. As a result, the Casper mattress has received high praise from Consumer Reports, was named one of Time magazine’s best inventions, and holds multiple industrial design awards.Does the Casper mattress have any safety or environmental certifications?All the foams in the Casper mattress are CertiPUR-US®  certified. These foams are made without ozone depleters, PBDE flame retardants, mercury, lead and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, phthalates regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They are Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million).SEE ALL MATTRESS FAQSTalk to a human, not a botChat with UsCall or text us+1 888-498-0003YOUR CARTYour Cart Is EmptySHOP NOWGot questions?

Don't worry about the price, that little extra pays off huge!

Don't worry about the price, that little extra pays off huge!



So new year's night I was in a serious motorcycle accident that almost cost me my life. It did cost me my arm and shoulder bones having to be replaced with cadaver bones along with screws and plates being implanted. Also had a compression fraction on my l1 in my back. Bear with me this is leading somewhere. So once I got out of the hospital in February I was eager to get home into my comfort zone. But the first time I attempted to sleep in my standard memory foam mattress, I knew something was terribly wrong. I woke up 2 hours into the night because my spine was bending right at the fracture point while laying on my side. The only place I've been able to sleep is on the couch for the last 6 months. So about 2 months ago I decided I had to do something. So I went out and bought a sleep number bed for 3k. Big mistake. Just know that even if you buy one and decide its not for you it will still cost you 800 dollars in delivery and pickup charges.... what a joke right? So after experimenting with it and deciding it wasn't my cup of tea, back on the couch I went. Then a friend informed me of the Casper mattress. So I jump on the internet to do by due diligence and after debating for a couple weeks I decided to pull the trigger as my couch has gotten lopsided from me sleeping on it everyday. I received my mattress in 4 business days, not bad at all. Set up was a snap as I was expecting the usual wait time you have with memory foams ( letting the breathe). I just cut the plastic and it came to life! So here we go time for the test........I slept like a baby!!! It was a little firmer than what I was expecting but oddly there's zero pressure points. My spine is no longer bending! After 4 nights on the miracle mattress I'm in love! Easily the best purchase i've made in my life! I slept so well last night that I didn't move once. I know this because I woke up with my arm stretched under my pillow and it was cramping because I hadn't moved it! If you have any spinal problems or general back issues roll the dice pull the trigger and change your life. I almost feel normal again. You really have nothing to lose as this comes with a 100 night trial. Just a heads up from a firm believer. People usually only write a review if theres a problem. Quite the opposite here. Im happy to spread the good word on a product that lives up to the expectations. These guys make a quality product and deserve the recognition. It will change your life people!!!

It's a nice bed. The best part, and the reason I went Casper, was price and the elimination of noisy springs. Took me about a week and a half to get used to it's firmer feel but I'm used to it now and sleep fine. It's a good mattress but I don't think it's the life changing mattress that some of the reviews claim it is.

In my 37 years alive I've never slept on anything like it! I love my Casper mattress! I sleep all the way through the night now and I wake up pain free!! My old mattress made me wake up several times a night and I would wake up in horrible pain! Since I started sleeping on mine in May I haven't had any pain or restless nights!! I'm a walking advertisement for Casper!!

Takes some time to break in, but after 45 days, still enjoying it



This is my first foam mattress, in the past I've had eggshell pads on top of inner spring.  I'm used to sleeping with a comforter, but so far I haven't used it much (it's July right now) because the mattress traps heat pretty well.  I've rarely been too hot, although I'm guessing it would get pretty toasty with another person on it.  Breaking it in was uncomfortable, even painful sometimes; I didn't like waking up with sore shoulders.  The only other thing I didn't expect is how heavy the mattress is.  A full size is over 80 pounds.  I don't have a reference point, but that seemed plenty heavy to me, especially when I had to move it myself.

Slightly better than the floor 



My lower back is in so much pain when I wake up. Even when I try to fall asleep my back hurts so badly I want to cry because I know I will be having yet another night of terrible sleep. I look forward to sleeping on hotel mattresses because they are more comfortable. This mattress is great for a lot of people but for me it just does not work. I even have the mattress topper they provided me and it does not work

These updates include adding a fourth layer to increase pressure relief, developing proprietary foams for added durability and breathability, and creating a removable cover that’s easier to clean.8,109+25,000+700+Average star ratings based on listed sources. Updated 04/24/17See how we evaluate our productsOur R&D team uses three main methods to inform product improvements:USER TESTINGIn the beginning, we created beta models and invited friends and seasoned snoozers to A/B test them. We continue to enlist Casper customers to test improvements.DURABILITY TESTINGWe do feel testing, force profile testing, airflow testing, rebound testing, compression testing... well, you get the idea. Finally, we simulate 10 years of sleep to make sure it will last and last.RESEARCHOur dedicated research team conducts interviews and runs studies to understand sleep habits. These learnings help us make products that reflect real people’s needs.“Supremely comfortable”COOL BY DESIGNUnlike traditional memory foam mattresses, the Casper is designed to help you sleep cool. The open-cell top layer uses convection and conduction to flow heat away from your body. Similarly, the memory foam layer leverages airflow to pull heat out of the top layer, leaving you cool and comfortable.Why does heat flow matter?While you’re asleep, your body acts like a little thermal engine, putting out the equivalent heat of a 100W light bulb. By using foams that leverage convection (heat transfer through air) and conduction (heat transfer through solids), we’re able to pull heat away from your body, and disperse it back into the atmosphere.LESS STORES, MORE SNORESWe flipped the mattress industry on its head by eliminating showrooms, employing smart logistics, and using compression technology to ship the Casper mattress in a compact box. This allows us to offer a premium mattress for a fraction of the price.Red door with Casper Mattress boxRed door with Casper Mattress box“Changing the way people shop for mattresses”100 NIGHT TRIAL, FREE RETURN PICKUPSleep on it, lounge on it, dream on it — if you don't love it, we'll give you a full refund.

As with all foam beds, you want as much direct support under the mattress as possible. A wooden slatted or platform bed offers the most support. For optimal support under all size sizes ( twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, Cal king ) , we suggest using the Casper foundation.Why is the Casper mattress better than its lookalikes?The engineering behind the Casper mattress goes far beyond aesthetics. Our mattress is the result of intensive research and continuous development by our 30-person San Francisco R&D team, who collectively hold more than 50 patents. Unlike putting a cover over an off-the-shelf construction, our approach allows us to quickly respond to customer feedback and continually enhance our mattress. As a result, the Casper mattress has received high praise from Consumer Reports, was named one of Time magazine’s best inventions, and holds multiple industrial design awards.Does the Casper mattress have any safety or environmental certifications?All the foams in the Casper mattress are CertiPUR-US®  certified. These foams are made without ozone depleters, PBDE flame retardants, mercury, lead and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, phthalates regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They are Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million).SEE ALL MATTRESS FAQSTalk to a human, not a botChat with UsCall or text us+1 888-498-0003YOUR CARTYour Cart Is EmptySHOP NOWGot questions?

Don't worry about the price, that little extra pays off huge!



So new year's night I was in a serious motorcycle accident that almost cost me my life. It did cost me my arm and shoulder bones having to be replaced with cadaver bones along with screws and plates being implanted. Also had a compression fraction on my l1 in my back. Bear with me this is leading somewhere. So once I got out of the hospital in February I was eager to get home into my comfort zone. But the first time I attempted to sleep in my standard memory foam mattress, I knew something was terribly wrong. I woke up 2 hours into the night because my spine was bending right at the fracture point while laying on my side. The only place I've been able to sleep is on the couch for the last 6 months. So about 2 months ago I decided I had to do something. So I went out and bought a sleep number bed for 3k. Big mistake. Just know that even if you buy one and decide its not for you it will still cost you 800 dollars in delivery and pickup charges.... what a joke right? So after experimenting with it and deciding it wasn't my cup of tea, back on the couch I went. Then a friend informed me of the Casper mattress. So I jump on the internet to do by due diligence and after debating for a couple weeks I decided to pull the trigger as my couch has gotten lopsided from me sleeping on it everyday. I received my mattress in 4 business days, not bad at all. Set up was a snap as I was expecting the usual wait time you have with memory foams ( letting the breathe). I just cut the plastic and it came to life! So here we go time for the test........I slept like a baby!!! It was a little firmer than what I was expecting but oddly there's zero pressure points. My spine is no longer bending! After 4 nights on the miracle mattress I'm in love! Easily the best purchase i've made in my life! I slept so well last night that I didn't move once. I know this because I woke up with my arm stretched under my pillow and it was cramping because I hadn't moved it! If you have any spinal problems or general back issues roll the dice pull the trigger and change your life. I almost feel normal again. You really have nothing to lose as this comes with a 100 night trial. Just a heads up from a firm believer. People usually only write a review if theres a problem. Quite the opposite here. Im happy to spread the good word on a product that lives up to the expectations. These guys make a quality product and deserve the recognition. It will change your life people!!!

It's a nice bed. The best part, and the reason I went Casper, was price and the elimination of noisy springs. Took me about a week and a half to get used to it's firmer feel but I'm used to it now and sleep fine. It's a good mattress but I don't think it's the life changing mattress that some of the reviews claim it is.

Casper mattress, my new best friend!



In my 37 years alive I've never slept on anything like it! I love my Casper mattress! I sleep all the way through the night now and I wake up pain free!! My old mattress made me wake up several times a night and I would wake up in horrible pain! Since I started sleeping on mine in May I haven't had any pain or restless nights!! I'm a walking advertisement for Casper!!

Takes some time to break in, but after 45 days, still enjoying it

Takes some time to break in, but after 45 days, still enjoying it



This is my first foam mattress, in the past I've had eggshell pads on top of inner spring.  I'm used to sleeping with a comforter, but so far I haven't used it much (it's July right now) because the mattress traps heat pretty well.  I've rarely been too hot, although I'm guessing it would get pretty toasty with another person on it.  Breaking it in was uncomfortable, even painful sometimes; I didn't like waking up with sore shoulders.  The only other thing I didn't expect is how heavy the mattress is.  A full size is over 80 pounds.  I don't have a reference point, but that seemed plenty heavy to me, especially when I had to move it myself.

We have been sleeping on our queen Casper for a little over thirty days. Honestly it's not working for us. Seems like a good mattress but we get up sore every morning.

Slightly better than the floor 



My lower back is in so much pain when I wake up. Even when I try to fall asleep my back hurts so badly I want to cry because I know I will be having yet another night of terrible sleep. I look forward to sleeping on hotel mattresses because they are more comfortable. This mattress is great for a lot of people but for me it just does not work. I even have the mattress topper they provided me and it does not work
