Early life[edit]
Born in Camden, New Jersey, Gordon's parents were both active in the civil rights movement. A 1968 graduate of Gettysburg College, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, and a 1988 Master's degree in Management (M.B.A.) graduate of the Sloan Fellows program of the MIT Sloan School of Management.
Career[edit]
Gordon's professional career began at Bell of Pennsylvania, where he rose in corporate management to become the Head of the Retail Markets Division of Verizon upon his retirement in December 2003. Other Verizon executives have credited him with helping to promote diversity and a corporate culture based on customer service at the telecom company.
The American Advertising Federation inducted him into the Advertising Hall of Fame, the industry’s most prestigious honor, in March 2007. Ebony magazine named him one of its “100 Most Influential Black Americans and Organization Leaders” in May 2006. He was ranked #6 on Fortune magazine’s list of the “50 Most Powerful Black Executives” in July 2002. Black Enterprise magazine named him executive of the year in 1998.
Gordon is a member of the boards of CBS Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Tyco International, Ltd., where he serves as lead director. He is a diversity consultant to Fortune 500 companies. Gordon is a trustee of U.S. Fund for UNICEF, National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, and Newport Festivals Foundation; a member of the Advisory Boards for New York Urban League, and Bishop John T. Walker School for Boys; and a member of the Executive Leadership Council. He previously served on the boards of Southern Company, Office Depot, Best Foods, Infinity Broadcasting and Bartech Group; previously chaired the Chancellor's Advisory Board on Student Motivation in the New York Public School System; was a trustee of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Foundation, The Barnes Foundation, Gettysburg College and Lincoln Center.
NAACP[edit]
Gordon's selection as NAACP president on 25 June 2005 was widely regarded as unusual — most of the organization's past presidents have been prominent figures in politics, religion, or the civil rights movement before holding the office. The only candidate seriously considered by the organization's board, he was approved by a unanimous vote and was confirmed at the July 2005 NAACP convention. He succeeded Kweisi Mfume, who resigned his post as NAACP president in late 2004.
President George W. Bush made his first appearance at the NAACP on July 20, 2006, half-way through his second term.[2] After having snubbed the organization for most of his presidency, it was Gordon's "moderate" political views that led Bush to acquiesce to the appearance, according to White House spokesman Tony Snow.
Citing strain with the board, Gordon resigned in March 2007. He stated "I did not step into the role to be a caretaker, to be dictated to," Gordon said. "I stepped into the role to understand as best I could the needs of the African American community and then to propose strategies and policies and programs and practices that could improve conditions for African Americans…. The things I had in mind were not consistent with what some — unfortunately, too many — on the board had in mind." [3]

Gordon is a member of the boards of CBS Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Tyco International, Ltd., where he serves as lead director. He is a diversity consultant to Fortune 500 companies. Gordon is a trustee of U.S. Fund for UNICEF, National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, and Newport Festivals Foundation; a member of the Advisory Boards for New York Urban League, and Bishop John T. Walker School for Boys; and a member of the Executive Leadership Council. He previously served on the boards of Southern Company, Office Depot, Best Foods, Infinity Broadcasting and Bartech Group; previously chaired the Chancellor's Advisory Board on Student Motivation in the New York Public School System; was a trustee of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Foundation, The Barnes Foundation, Gettysburg College and Lincoln Center.
NAACP[edit]
Gordon's selection as NAACP president on 25 June 2005 was widely regarded as unusual — most of the organization's past presidents have been prominent figures in politics, religion, or the civil rights movement before holding the office. The only candidate seriously considered by the organization's board, he was approved by a unanimous vote and was confirmed at the July 2005 NAACP convention. He succeeded Kweisi Mfume, who resigned his post as NAACP president in late 2004.
President George W. Bush made his first appearance at the NAACP on July 20, 2006, half-way through his second term.[2] After having snubbed the organization for most of his presidency, it was Gordon's "moderate" political views that led Bush to acquiesce to the appearance, according to White House spokesman Tony Snow.
Citing strain with the board, Gordon resigned in March 2007. He stated "I did not step into the role to be a caretaker, to be dictated to," Gordon said. "I stepped into the role to understand as best I could the needs of the African American community and then to propose strategies and policies and programs and practices that could improve conditions for African Americans…. The things I had in mind were not consistent with what some — unfortunately, too many — on the board had in mind." [3]

Bruce Scott Gordon (born February 15, 1946) is a business executive who spent most of his career with Verizon and currently serves as a corporate director of CBS, Northrop Grumman, and Tyco International.

Early life[edit]
Born in Camden, New Jersey, Gordon's parents were both active in the civil rights movement. A 1968 graduate of Gettysburg College, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, and a 1988 Master's degree in Management (M.B.A.) graduate of the Sloan Fellows program of the MIT Sloan School of Management.
Career[edit]
Gordon's professional career began at Bell of Pennsylvania, where he rose in corporate management to become the Head of the Retail Markets Division of Verizon upon his retirement in December 2003. Other Verizon executives have credited him with helping to promote diversity and a corporate culture based on customer service at the telecom company.
The American Advertising Federation inducted him into the Advertising Hall of Fame, the industry’s most prestigious honor, in March 2007. Ebony magazine named him one of its “100 Most Influential Black Americans and Organization Leaders” in May 2006. He was ranked #6 on Fortune magazine’s list of the “50 Most Powerful Black Executives” in July 2002. Black Enterprise magazine named him executive of the year in 1998.
Gordon is a member of the boards of CBS Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Tyco International, Ltd., where he serves as lead director. He is a diversity consultant to Fortune 500 companies. Gordon is a trustee of U.S. Fund for UNICEF, National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, and Newport Festivals Foundation; a member of the Advisory Boards for New York Urban League, and Bishop John T. Walker School for Boys; and a member of the Executive Leadership Council. He previously served on the boards of Southern Company, Office Depot, Best Foods, Infinity Broadcasting and Bartech Group; previously chaired the Chancellor's Advisory Board on Student Motivation in the New York Public School System; was a trustee of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Foundation, The Barnes Foundation, Gettysburg College and Lincoln Center.

Product Description
John Calvin's "Institutes of the Christian Religion" is a defining book of the Reformation and a pillar of Protestant theology. First published in Latin in 1536 and in Calvin's native French in 1541, the "Institutes" argues for the majesty of God and for justification by faith alone. The book decisively shaped Calvinism as a major religious and intellectual force in Europe and throughout the world. Here, Bruce Gordon provides an essential biography of Calvin's influential and enduring theological masterpiece, tracing the diverse ways it has been read and interpreted from Calvin's time to today.Gordon explores the origins and character of the "Institutes," looking closely at its theological and historical roots, and explaining how it evolved through numerous editions to become a complete summary of Reformation doctrine. He shows how the development of the book reflected the evolving thought of Calvin, who instilled in the work a restlessness that reflected his understanding of the Christian life as a journey to God. Following Calvin's death in 1564, the "Institutes" continued to be reprinted, reedited, and reworked through the centuries. Gordon describes how it has been used in radically different ways, such as in South Africa, where it was invoked both to defend and attack the horror of apartheid. He examines its vexed relationship with the historical Calvin--a figure both revered and despised--and charts its robust and contentious reception history, taking readers from the Puritans and Voltaire to YouTube, the novels of Marilynne Robinson, and to China and Africa, where the "Institutes" continues to find new audiences today.

‘Mother nature is the best designer:’ Highlights from Gordon Bruce’s spring 2014 graduation speech

“Maintain truth to your core and you will be beautiful and create beautiful things in your future,” Industrial Design alumnus Gordon Bruce (BS 72) told graduating students during Art Center’s Spring 2014 Graduation Ceremony on Sat., April 19, where he received a Lifetime Achievement Alumni Award.
Saying that the award meant “more to me than you’ll ever know,” Bruce delivered  a lively speech in which he recounted: another college’s admissions counselor telling his dad that his son “didn’t have the right stuff” to design; sharpening pencils as a part-time office boy at the studio of architect and designer Eliot Noyes; meeting the “gods of design” through the College’s lecture series, including Charles Eames, Paolo Soleri and Niels Diffrient, the latter with whom he became best friends.

Bruce completely won the audience over when he brought out some props for “show and tell.” From behind the podium he pulled out the first drawing he ever created at Art Center, which he made for a class taught by legendary instructor Ted Youngkin. He told the students that he had turned down a tantalizing late night invitation from a beautiful woman in order to complete that drawing for Youngkin’s class. ”The next morning I said, ‘Mr. Youngkin, do you realize what I sacrificed for you?’,” Bruce said with a laugh. “But [he] had this capability of making you want to do something for him.”

Later, Bruce brought out a bunch of bananas and told a story about teaching at Samsung’s Innovation Design Lab and asking his students to spend ₩5,000 on a product, bring it to class and tell him why it’s a beautiful object. Bruce said they brought back “the worst stuff, terrible, all kitschy,” and then showed the class what be bought for the same amount of money: a bunch of bananas. Bruce continued:
They said, ‘Bananas? What do bananas have to do with design?’ Mother Nature is the best designer. It comes in a bunch. You can buy as many as you want. It’s customizable. It’s convenient. [Places a banana in his pocket] It fits in your pocket. It’s intuitive: I know you don’t eat a banana this way. [Pretending to eat the banana like corn on the cob] Sanitation, [pointing to the peel] it protects the inside. Biodegradable. Potassium. [taking a bite] Delicious. [chewing the banana] Easily manufactured. It’s the biggest market in the world: everybody loves bananas! So I told my my fellow designers, ‘Imagine if you could design a product that uses these same principles.’ … So they said, ‘You mean, we should design a cell phone that looks like a banana?’ [sighs] So I realized I had a long way to go.
After which Bruce received a loud round of applause.
