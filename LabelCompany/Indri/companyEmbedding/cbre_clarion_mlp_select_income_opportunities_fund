Commentary

 As of June 30, 2017 

	Month in review:


		June was a tale of two halves. Early in the month, European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi led the Eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation, which caused rates to move much lower across Europe. However, coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve.

		While the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey was a non-event as far as financial markets were concerned, the Fed raised the Fed funds rate for the second time this year in mid-month, while laying out a plan to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which should start in the near term.

		As of now, it appears the Fed will allow $6 billion of U.S. Treasury exposure to roll off monthly, and $4 billion for agency mortgages, with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact. While one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise, a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening, with rates near their year-to-date lows yet again, although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month.

		Looking forward, commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors. In addition, we may learn of nominations to fill vacant Fed seats in addition to Janet Yellen’s future, as her term is set to expire in February 2018. This of course would have implications for global markets.


	Looking ahead:


		The first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of 2017.

		Global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits, so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets.

		Most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the Fed hikes again in 2017; however, our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the Fed’s balance sheet.

		We are also paying close attention to the ECB as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy. The ECB has remained very accommodative; however, growth and labor markets are improving. In addition, a reduction in geo-political risks may make it more likely that the ECB moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.00% for A Shares, 1.50% for C Shares, 0.75% for I Shares and 0.55% for R5 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 6/30/2017 for A Shares, 6/30/2017 for C Shares, 6/30/2017 for I Shares and 6/30/2017 for R5 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal Index represents the U.S. Aggregate Index, the U.S. High-Yield Corporate Index, the 144A Index, the Eurodollar Index, the Emerging Markets Index, and the non-ERISA portion of the CMBS Index. The BofA Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index is comprised of a single issue purchased at the beginning of the month and held for a full month. The index is rebalanced monthly and the issue selected is the outstanding Treasury Bill that matures closest to, but not beyond 3 months from the rebalancing date. The performance of the Lipper Alternative Credit Focus Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. International investing bears greater risk due to social, economic, regulatory and political instability in countries in "emerging markets." This makes emerging market securities more volatile and less liquid developed market securities. Changes in exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can also affect returns.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Duration: Measures price sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate changes. Average Life: The length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding.

Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

Other MLP Related Securities


These are derivative securities that own interests in their affiliated MLPs. Each one is slightly different, but the idea is to allow for tax exempt investors (individual and institutional) concerned with UBTI and K-1s to gain exposure to the individual MLP.

This category includes MLPs that used to trade and for whatever reason no longer trade. These MLPs were either acquired or went out of business. I am including the GPs that were bought out by their MLPs in this list. There are many more in the 1980s that I don’t know enough about, if you have info on those, send them and I will add them.

MLP Products


MLP Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)


These securities own MLPs directly and are structured as corporations (unless otherwise noted as RICs), which solves the UBTI issue, because the corporation pays the taxes. The layer of tax leakage makes these vehicles not track their underlying indexes well.

Primer On CEF Classes | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Primer On CEF ClassesJun. 28, 2017  8:43 AM ET|| Includes: ADX, AFB, AOD, AVK, BBN, BCX, BST, BTO, BTZ, BUI, CEF, CGR, DNP, ECC, EMD, EMF, EVV, EXG, FAX, FDEU, FOF, GDV, GLO, HQH, HYT, IFN, JPS, KYN, MGU, MXF, NAC, NMZ, OXLC, PCI, RA, RQI, SRV, TYG, UTG, VCF, VVR, WIWby: Stanford ChemistStanford Chemist ETF investing, closed-end funds, dividend investing, portfolio strategyMarketplaceCambridge Income LaboratorySummaryClosed-end funds (CEFs) cover a wide segment of the investment universe.I survey the different classes of CEFs in CEFConnect's database.Be aware that the labels are sometimes inconsistent.Author's note: This article was released to members of the Cambridge Income Laboratory about 1 month ago. A member asked me about the different classes of CEFs and the strategies that they employ. I thought that this information would make a good introductory article for people who are new to CEFs (closed end funds). First of all, CEFs are, at their core, funds, just like their cousins the mutual fund and the exchange-traded fund [ETF]. A little known fact is that CEFs actually have a longer history even than mutual funds, and are therefore way older than ETFs. I have previously surveyed the different types of exchange-traded products here: "Exchange-Traded Products Series Part 1: Why Invest?" CEFs, being funds, simply own stocks, bonds, commodities or other instruments, depending on their investment mandate. CEFs are also usually actively managed. Therefore, CEFs are merely a "wrapper" in which one can obtain their exposure to various asset classes, strategies or geographical allocations. It doesn't make sense to say, for example, that "I own 50% in stocks, 30% in bonds and 20% in CEFs", for the very reason that the CEFs are likely themselves invested in some combination of equities and debt. One can usually find a corresponding ETF that matches the investment mandate of a particular CEF (notable exceptions are CLO equity funds such as Oxford Lane Capital Corp (NASDAQ:OXLC) or Eagle Point Credit Company (NYSE:ECC), or perhaps "go anywhere" bond funds that have a highly flexible mandate). In that case, what are the advantages of owning the CEF over the ETF? I think can think of several:  Active management from a hopefully seasoned investment manager Leverage, often at much cheaper rate that can be accessed by retail investors (I am aware that ETFs/ETNs can be leveraged too, but they do not cover the entire investment universe) Most importantly, the ability of CEFs to trade at premium or discount offers both pitfalls and opportunities, such as CEF arbitrage 
 In terms of the different CEF classes on offer, I will use the categories employed by CEFConnect. The reason for this is that CEFConnect is probably the most widely used CEF resource site available, and using the same categories will allow readers to easily source more information about a specific CEF class should they desire. The classes can be searched using CEFConnect's "Fund Screener", by selecting the "Strategies" tab. There are currently a total of 532 CEFs in the CEFConnect's database. For each category, the number shown in parentheses indicates the number of CEFs in that class. I also present the largest CEF in each category as an example. Any comments of mine are in italics. I. Tax-free income (166)  High-yield (6) e.g. Nuveen Municipal High Income Opportunity Fund (NYSE:NMZ) National (80) e.g. AllianceBernstein National Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:AFB) State (80) e.g. Nuveen California Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NAC)  II. Taxable income (143)  Convertibles (4) e.g. Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund (NYSE:AVK) Government (3) e.g. Western Asset/Claymore Inflation-Linked Opportunities & Income Fund (NYSE:WIW) High-yield (37) e.g. BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund (NYSE:HYT) Investment grade (15) e.g. Blackrock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE:BTZ) Limited duration (5) e.g. Eaton Vance Limited Duration Income Fund (NYSEMKT:EVV) Mortgage bonds (9) e.g. Brookfield Real Assets Income Fund (NYSE:RA) Multi-sector (23) e.g. PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income (NYSE:PCI) - includes PIMCO's "go-anywhere" bond funds  Municipal (4) e.g. Blackrock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (NYSE:BBN) Preferreds (15) e.g. Nuveen Preferred Securities Income Fund (NYSE:JPS) Senior loan (28) e.g. Invesco Senior Income Trust (NYSE:VVR) - includes CLO equity funds such as Eagle Point Credit Company and Oxford Lane Capital Corp  III. U.S. equity (135) - note that this includes funds that may have partial international exposure  Covered call (27) e.g. Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income (NYSE:EXG) Dividend equity (2) e.g. Cohen & Steers Closed-End Opportunity Fund (NYSE:FOF) Equity tax-advantaged (8) e.g. Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE:GDV) General equity (18) e.g. Adams Diversified Equity Fund (NYSE:ADX) Hybrid growth & income (14) e.g. DNP Select Income Fund (NYSE:DNP) Real estate (global) (4) e.g. CBRE Clarion Global Real Estate (NYSE:IGR) Real estate (U.S.) (7) e.g. Cohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund (NYSE:RQI) Commodities (4) e.g. Central Fund of Canada (NYSEMKT:CEF) Energy/resources (8) e.g. BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (NYSE:BCX) Finance (2) e.g. John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (NYSE:BTO) Healthcare (6) e.g. Tekla Healthcare Investors (NYSE:HQH) MLP (26) e.g. Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company (NYSE:KYN) Utilities (9) e.g. Reaves Utility Income Fund (NYSEMKT:UTG) 
 IV. Non-U.S./other (88)  Asia equity (19) e.g. India Fund (NYSE:IFN) Emerging markets equity (6) e.g. Templeton Emerging Markets Fund (NYSE:EMF) Emerging markets income (8) e.g. Western Asset Emerging Markets Debt Fund (NYSE:EMD) Latin America equity (6) e.g. Mexico Fund (NYSE:MXF) Global equity (8) e.g. BlackRock Science & Technology Trust (NYSE:BST) Global equity dividend (5) e.g. Alpine Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (NYSE:AOD) Global hybrid growth & income (13) e.g. Clough Global Opportunities Fund (NYSEMKT:GLO) Global income (15) e.g. Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund (NYSEMKT:FAX) Other non-U.S. equity (7) e.g. First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (NYSE:FDEU) Undefined (1) e.g. Delaware Investments National Municipal Income Fund (NYSEMKT:VCF) - not sure why this doesn't belong in the muni category   Note that the CEFConnect categories are not the be all and end all, and oftentimes the classifications should be manually checked. For instance, the DNP Select Income Fund [DNP] is classified as "Hybrid growth & income" but with the majority of its portfolio (~86%) in utility stocks, it really should have belonged to the "Utilities" categories. Perhaps the meager 12% bond allocation of DNP is what caused it to be lumped with other hybrid funds, but if that's the case, why is Macquarie Global Infrastructure Total Return Fund (NYSE:MGU) (with ~65% in utility stocks but also ~25% in loans) also grouped in "Utilities" and not "Hybrid growth & income"? (I have previously written about DNP here: "I Would Avoid DNP Select Income Fund At The Present Time"). Additionally, the U.S./non-U.S. distinction used by CEFConnect is not always applied consistently. For example, Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income [EXG], with 36% non-U.S. exposure, is classed under "U.S. equity", whereas the BlackRock Science & Technology Trust [BST], which has even less international exposure (27% non-U.S.) is in the "Non-U.S./other" category. In some cases, a CEF could plausibly be classed under two or even more categories, but CEFConnect only allows a single designation. For instance, the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust [BCX] and the BlackRock Utility and Infrastructure Trust (BUI) both employ option writing to boost their income, but their investment focus means they are funneled into the "Energy/resources" and "Utilities" groups, respectively, rather than "Covered call".
 Moreover, these categories should just be considered as starting points for research CEF research. Even within a single category, fund performance can vary wildly. As a case in point, within the MLP space, the Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund (NYSE:TYG) has massively outperformed the Cushing MLP Total Return Fund (NYSE:SRV) over the past five years. I have previously written about SRV's debacle here: "Cushing MLP Total Return Fund: A Lesson For CEF Investors". This is why I spend significant time searching for the best CEF(s) to choose from each class, which would hopefully benefit you as well. 

 TYG Total Return Price data by YCharts If I were to organize CEFConnect's database from scratch, I might approach it in a slightly different way. In the members section of the Cambridge Income Laboratory, I have reorganized the CEF classes in a more logical format to aid portfolio construction.

Commentary

 As of June 30, 2017 

	Month in review:


		June was a tale of two halves. Early in the month, European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi led the Eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation, which caused rates to move much lower across Europe. However, coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve.

		While the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey was a non-event as far as financial markets were concerned, the Fed raised the Fed funds rate for the second time this year in mid-month, while laying out a plan to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which should start in the near term.

		As of now, it appears the Fed will allow $6 billion of U.S. Treasury exposure to roll off monthly, and $4 billion for agency mortgages, with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact. While one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise, a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening, with rates near their year-to-date lows yet again, although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month.

		Looking forward, commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors. In addition, we may learn of nominations to fill vacant Fed seats in addition to Janet Yellen’s future, as her term is set to expire in February 2018. This of course would have implications for global markets.


	Looking ahead:


		The first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of 2017.

		Global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits, so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets.

		Most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the Fed hikes again in 2017; however, our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the Fed’s balance sheet.

		We are also paying close attention to the ECB as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy. The ECB has remained very accommodative; however, growth and labor markets are improving. In addition, a reduction in geo-political risks may make it more likely that the ECB moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.00% for A Shares, 1.50% for C Shares, 0.75% for I Shares and 0.55% for R5 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 6/30/2017 for A Shares, 6/30/2017 for C Shares, 6/30/2017 for I Shares and 6/30/2017 for R5 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal Index represents the U.S. Aggregate Index, the U.S. High-Yield Corporate Index, the 144A Index, the Eurodollar Index, the Emerging Markets Index, and the non-ERISA portion of the CMBS Index. The BofA Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index is comprised of a single issue purchased at the beginning of the month and held for a full month. The index is rebalanced monthly and the issue selected is the outstanding Treasury Bill that matures closest to, but not beyond 3 months from the rebalancing date. The performance of the Lipper Alternative Credit Focus Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. International investing bears greater risk due to social, economic, regulatory and political instability in countries in "emerging markets." This makes emerging market securities more volatile and less liquid developed market securities. Changes in exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can also affect returns.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Duration: Measures price sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate changes. Average Life: The length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

Strategy and process

Diverse opportunities: The fund invests across all sectors of the U.S. bond market, including mortgage-backed securi­ties, corporate bonds, and other government obligations.
Flexible risk allocations: The fund takes a unique approach to asset allocation, dynamically establishing diversified risk expo­sures rather than sector exposures. 
Bottom-up approach: Security selection is the primary driver of returns, with sub-sector allocations and macro strategies also serving as potential alpha generators.







Manager commentary | Q2 2017
Despite retail, commercial real estate is an attractive sector
Mike Salm, Co-Head of Fixed Income, explains his positive view of the commercial real estate sector.













 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.



Objective
The fund seeks high current income consistent with what Putnam management believes to be prudent risk.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

Spread duration is displayed in years and reflects the contribution by sector to the portfolio's total spread duration with the exception of the Treasury and Interest-rate swap sectors where effective duration is displayed. Spread duration estimates the price sensitivity of a
specific sector or asset class to a 100 basis-point movement, 1%, (either widening or narrowing) in its yield spread relative to Treasuries. Effective duration provides a measure of a portfolio's interest-rate sensitivity. The longer a portfolio's duration, the more sensitive
the portfolio is to shifts in the interest rates. Allocations may not total 100% of net assets because the table includes the notional value of derivatives (the economic value for purposes of calculating periodic payment obligations), in addition to the market value of securities.

Fund characteristics will vary over time.
Due to rounding, percentages may not equal 100%.


 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is an unmanaged index of U.S. investment-grade fixed-income securities. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage backed investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). The fund may have to invest the proceeds from prepaid investments, including mortgage backed investments, in other investments with less attractive terms and yields. Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure (which may be considered leverage) and, in the case of over-the-counter instruments, the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. Bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, changing market perceptions (including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates), changes in government intervention in the financial markets, and factors related to a specific issuer or industry. These factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the fund's portfolio holdings. You can lose money by investing in the fund.
Credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets as of the date indicated above. A bond rated BBB or higher (A-3 or higher, for short-term debt) is considered investment grade. This chart reflects the highest security rating provided by one or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Short-term cash bonds are included in their closest long-term equivalent rating category. To be announced (TBA) mortgage commitments, if any, are included based on their issuer ratings. Ratings and portfolio credit quality will vary over time. Derivative instruments, including currency forwards, are only included to the extent of any unrealized gain or loss on such instruments and are shown in the not-rated category. Cash is also shown in the not-rated category. Derivative offset values are included in the not-rated category and may result in negative weights. The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
