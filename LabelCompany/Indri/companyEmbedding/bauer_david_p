Two seasoned educators provide step-by-step instructions on how to think inductively and do inductive Bible study, demonstrating the practice of that approach.




Description


										Following up Robert Traina's classic Methodical Bible Study, this book introduces the practice of inductive Bible study to a new generation of students, pastors, and church leaders. The authors, two seasoned educators with over sixty combined years of experience in the classroom, offer guidance on adopting an inductive posture and provide step-by-step instructions on how to do inductive Bible study. They engage in conversation with current hermeneutical issues, setting forth well-grounded principles and processes for biblical interpretation and appropriation. The process they present incorporates various methods of biblical study to help readers hear the message of the Bible on its own terms.

                           The objective of this program was to develop a lightweight, long pulse homopolar generator. The generator is designed to deliver
                              250 kW at 10kA for pulses greater than 10 seconds. This report reviews the truncated drum (rotor) design and the testing performed.
                              The main design features, such as active excitation coil cooling, of the generator components are reviewed. Energy Storage

                           The response sensitivity of jet engine fan blade-like structures to the details of impact loading were studied. In particular,
                              impacts of birds and ice on jet engines are difficult to model analytically. This report provides guidance in determining
                              the spatical and temporal loading parameters that must be most accurately modeled in a coupled load-response analysis. A finite
                              element model of a cantilever plate was subjected to various spatial and temporal loading details to determine important parameters.
                              The cantilever plate was 7.62 cm (3-inches) by 24.46 cm (9.63-inches) by 3.81 mm (0.15-inches) thick. Applied loads simulated
                              the impact load levels similar to a 85 g (3 ounce) bird impacting at 244 m/sec (800 ft/sec). The plate response was monitored
                              by observing deflected shapes at several increments of time during and after impact. The results show that the cantilever
                              plate and presumably a jet engine fan blade are very sensitive to the level of momentum transfer. The detailed spatial and
                              temporal loads that most affect momentum transfer were found to be of particular importance to the structure response. (Author)

                           As longer projectiles are accelerated. the efficiency (projectile mass/launch mass) of the launch package decreases. The reduction
                              in efficiency makes launching projectiles with a L/D (length-to-diameter ratio) greater than 20 undesirable. EM guns have
                              several launch characteristics that differ from conventional guns. Higher launch velocities are achievable in EM guns because
                              sonic gas velocities do not limit the projectile velocity. Acceleration profiles for EM guns are more constant. The acceleration
                              forces can be distributed on the projectile easily because the accelerating force can be distributed with multiple armatures.
                              These characteristics combine to make EN guns a very attractive approach for launching very long (i.e. high L/D ratio) projectiles.
                              Railgun launchers with multiple armatures can distribute the accelerating force. Each armature is supplied gun current for
                              acceleration through its own set of rails. This multi-rail, multi-armature concept was tested at the railgun test facility.
                              The results demonstrated feasibility. We were able to control current distribution to multiple armatures. This paper describes
                              the theory and test results for multi-armature launch of high L/D projectiles

                           Railgun hypervelocity performance has not been repeatably demonstrated at velocities over 6 km/s. A significant performance
                              limiting phenomena is the formation of secondary current paths in parallel with the main projectile accelerating plasma. A
                              confined plasma armature technique was developed to prevent secondary armature formation. Confinement prevents loss of ionized
                              material from the plasma armature and thereby prevents formation of a low rail-to-rail conductance. We controlled pressure
                              in the confined armature via controlled venting through ports in the rails. Railgun tests with the confined armature show
                              that sealing at the rail-confinement vessel interface is critical and difficult to achieve. Our tests show that during low
                              seal leakage operation secondaries are prevented. However, maintaining good seal for the entire launch is very difficult

                           The strain-rate effect on strain to failure of copper was experimentally investigated. Both Oxygen Free High Conductivity
                              (OFHC) copper and Electrolytic Tough Pitch (ETP) copper were studied. Ultimate strains were measured for a range of strain
                              rates from 0.0001 strain/second to over 10000.0 strain/second. Normal quasi-static tensile machines were used at low strain
                              rates, a split Hopkinson bar apparatus was used at strain rates of 1000.0 strain/second, and an exploding tube technique was
                              developed for strain rates to over 10000.0 strain/second. High speed photographic techniques and post shot fragment analysis
                              were used to determine the strain rate effects. Copper shows little strain rate dependence below 1000.0 strain/second with
                              average ultimate strains around 0.4. Above approximately 5000.0 strain/second, several geometrical and material related factors
                              cause the average ultimate strain to increase to values above 1.3, due to suppression of necking in the material until very
                              late in the straining process. OFHC copper and ETP copper behave much the same to strain rates of 10000.0 strain/second
