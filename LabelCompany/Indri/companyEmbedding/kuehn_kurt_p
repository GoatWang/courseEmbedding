MELVILLE, N.Y., June 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Henry Schein, Inc. (Nasdaq:   HSIC), the world's largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners, announced that at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held yesterday, Joseph L. Herring and Kurt P. Kuehn were elected to the Company's Board of Directors for one-year terms. These new directors fill vacancies resulting from the retirement of directors Norman S. Matthews and Louis W. Sullivan, M.D.








With these changes, Henry Schein continues to have 15 directors, including 10 independent directors.
"We are extremely fortunate to attract such high-quality directors to our Board. Joseph brings to Henry Schein comprehensive knowledge of pharmaceuticals, management and sales, and Kurt has extensive experience in distribution logistics, as well as in corporate finance and accounting. We look forward to the contributions both will make to advance the strategic goals of the Company," said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein.
Mr. Herring's career in health care spans more than 35 years. He served as CEO of the drug-development services company Covance Inc. for more than a decade, through its acquisition by Laboratory Corporation of America, Inc. (LabCorp) in February 2015.  Earlier in his career, he held senior leadership positions with Caremark International and American Hospital Supply Corporation. Mr. Herring currently serves on the nonprofit board for University Medical Center of Princeton and previously served on the board of the Association of Clinical Research Organizations, including as Chairman. As a director of Henry Schein, Mr. Herring will serve on the board's Strategic Advisory Committee.
Mr. Kuehn spent his entire career, which spanned nearly four decades, at United Parcel Service, Inc., (UPS), a global leader in logistics. Most recently, he served as CFO of UPS for eight years, through his retirement in 2015. At UPS, he also held leadership positions in sales and marketing, engineering, operations and strategic cost planning. Mr. Kuehn is also a director at NCR Corporation. As a director of Henry Schein, Mr. Kuehn will serve on the board's Audit Committee.
Mr. Matthews was named a director of Henry Schein in 2002, and has worked as an independent consultant and venture capitalist since 1989. From 1978 to 1988, Mr. Matthews served in various senior management positions for Federated Department Stores, Inc., including president from 1987 to 1988. In 2005, Mr. Matthews was named as one of eight outstanding directors by the Outstanding Directors Exchange (an annual award voted on by peer directors and awarded to an outstanding director for the key role he or she played during a crisis, business transformation or turnaround).  
Dr. Sullivan was named a director of Henry Schein in 2003. He is President Emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine, and from 1989 to 1993, he served as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. Dr. Sullivan served as chair of the President's Commission on Historically Black Colleges and Universities from 2002 to 2009, and was co-chair of the President's Commission on HIV and AIDS from 2001 to 2006. Dr. Sullivan is the founding dean of Morehouse School of Medicine, the founding president of the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools and is a member of the board of numerous charitable organizations. Dr. Sullivan is the recipient of more than 60 honorary degrees.  
After retiring from the Company's Board of Directors, it is expected that Mr. Mathews and Dr. Sullivan will continue their relationship with Henry Schein. Mr. Matthews will provide consulting services to the Company on various matters, including marketing, strategy and executive education. Dr. Sullivan will assume the role of Co-Chair of the Henry Schein Cares Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that carries out its mission through financial and health care product donations to support health care professionals and community-based programs focused on prevention, wellness, treatment, and education; disaster preparedness and relief; and capacity building of health institutions that provide training and care. 
"Norman Matthews and Dr. Sullivan have helped guide Henry Schein through a period of unprecedented growth and change," added Mr. Bergman. "They have been an integral part of Henry Schein's successful journey and have served the Company with integrity and intelligence. On behalf of my colleagues, my fellow directors and our shareholders, I extend our heartfelt thanks to Norm and Lou for their many contributions to Team Schein."

                                         said Tuesday Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn, age 60, will retire effective July 1, after eight years in the role, and 38 years with the company. The package-delivery giant named 34-year company veteran Richard Peretz, age 53, as CFO starting July 1. He is currently corporate controller and treasurer. "Kurt has provided insightful judgment and strong leadership, based on his extensive career experience and broad business perspective. He has helped UPS to take advantage of industry trends and prepare for the future," said Chief Executive David Abney. Earlier, UPS reported a first-quarter profit that beat expectations, while sales fell shy. The stock rose 0.7% in premarket trade. It has lost 12% year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.4%.

Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history
              
              One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co. reports Q2 loss, but growth in digital business
              
              Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co.  reported second-quarter earnings before the market opened on Friday and said digital-only subscribers grew nearly 14% from the previous year's first quarter. The company reported a net loss of $37.4 million, or $4.91 per share for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $14.7 million, or $1.89 per share during the same quarter a year ago. The adjusted loss per share was 79 cents. McClatchy's revenue hit $225.1 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the prior year. Total advertising revenue revenues were down 11% compared with the same quarter last year, while digital-only advertising revenue grew by 10%. The company said that the rate of decline in total advertising slowed in the quarter. "As I have mentioned before, achieving a normalized operating environment takes some time in digital transitions," McClatchy Chief Executive Craig Forman said in a statement. "While we continue to see strong headwinds in print advertising, we also are seeing our digital efforts in all aspects of the business moderate those headwinds." McClatchy's average total unique visitors to the company's online products grew close to 15% to 66 million in the quarter. Shares of McClatchy were inactive in morning trade on Friday, but have declined more than 34% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  have gained more than 10%.

Polaris beats profit and sales expectation as ORV and snowmobile growth helps boost results
              
              Polaris Industries Inc.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit that fell to $62.0 million, or 97 cents a share, from $71.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same period a year ago. The off-road vehicle maker said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.16, above the FactSet consensus of $1.08. Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

              Recreational vehicles company Polaris Industries Inc.  recalled about 25,600 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The recall involves 2014 Sportsman 570 model ATVs sold from April 2014 through May 2017 for $6,500 to $7,700 in several colors, which were made by Polaris in the U.S., according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall follows 30 reports of fuel leaks and four incidents involving a fire, although no injuries had been reported.

The stock, which was up 1.2% in afternoon trade, has rallied 12.9% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.4%.

San Francisco seeks court order to force Uber, Lyft to disclose recordsSan Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said Friday his office is seeking a court order to force ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber to comply with the office's subpoenas, filed in June, that seek records on the companies' driving practices, disability access, and services in the city. Petitions in the San Francisco Superior Court "are aimed at ensuring Uber and Lyft's estimated 45,000 drivers in San Francisco do not create a public nuisance," according to a statement. The companies were given "multiple opportunities" to comply with subpoenas but haven't done so. Lyft wanted "unreasonable provisions" to comply and Uber objected to the subpoenas and refused to produce documents or data, according to the statement.

Cost to rent military support office in Trump Tower: $130,000 a monthDonald Trump hasn't slept at his home in Trump Tower since becoming president, but the U.S. government is still paying a whopping $130,000 a month to lease space there for a military support office,  . According to the report, the government signed a $2.39 million lease for a 3,475-square-foot space at Trump Tower from April 11, 2017 to Sept. 30, 2018 for the White House Military Office -- which provides the president's medical, food, transportation and communications needs. The Journal obtained the information through a freedom of information request. The cost is significantly higher than the market rate in comparable buildings, with the Journal calling it "one of the most expensive residential rentals in Manhattan." The name of the owner of the space was redacted from the document, but a government spokesperson told the Journal the space was owned by a private individual not affiliated with the Trump Organization.
