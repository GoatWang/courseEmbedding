GLENWOOD, Ill., Aug. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Landauer, Inc. (NYSE:   LDR), a recognized leader in personal and environmental radiation measurement and monitoring, outsourced medical physics services and high quality medical consumable accessories, today announced that its Board of Directors has elected Michael P. Kaminski to succeed Michael T. Leatherman as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective October 1, 2015. Mr. Kaminski has also been appointed to the company's Board of Directors, effective the same date. Mr. Kaminski currently serves as President of Landauer's Radiation Measurement business.
In addition, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Leatherman to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and announced that Robert Cronin, Landauer's current Chairman, will become the Board's Lead Independent Director, both effective October 1, 2015. 
Mr. Leatherman said, "It has been an honor to lead Landauer, and I'm proud of the progress the company has made on its growth initiatives. We are well positioned as the leading provider of enterprise-wide radiation management solutions and poised to capitalize on the significant market opportunities ahead.  Over the past few years, Mike Kaminski has been critical to our efforts, and I look forward to continuing to support Mike and the rest of our outstanding team as the company builds on its strong platform for future growth."
Mr. Cronin stated, "We have a highly skilled and seasoned executive in Mike Kaminski, with a demonstrated track record and a deep understanding of our business and our customers. During his tenure, Mike has made exceptional contributions to Landauer, including driving innovation and market development, implementing lean processes and positioning our Radiation Measurement business as an engine for future growth.  We are confident in Mike's ability to lead the company forward and execute on our plan for sustainable growth."
Cronin continued, "On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank Mike Leatherman for his tremendous leadership during an important time for the company.  It has been a pleasure to work with him, and we look forward to continuing to benefit from his strategic counsel in his new role as Executive Chairman."
Mr. Kaminski stated, "I am excited to have the opportunity to lead this outstanding organization, and I look forward to continuing to work with Mike Leatherman in his new role as well as with our entire management team and talented professionals around the world. Today, we are successfully executing on our key initiatives and are well positioned to meet the emerging needs for a broader radiation management solution.  We continue to see strong demand for our solutions and believe we have the right plan in place to leverage Landauer's unique market position and drive significant growth and long-term value for shareholders."  
Mr. Kaminski, 55, joined Landauer in April 2013 as President of the Radiation Measurement Division, the company's largest business segment. Prior to joining Landauer, Mr. Kaminski was the President and CEO of Stereotaxis, a medical robotic company. Before Stereotaxis, Mr. Kaminski spent nearly 20 years at Hill-Rom Inc. where he held several functional positions, including sales, service, marketing, and operations.  He also served in key executive leadership positions, which included general management of the hospital business. During Mr. Kaminski's tenure at Hill-Rom, the company grew from $100M to over $1.1B in revenue.
