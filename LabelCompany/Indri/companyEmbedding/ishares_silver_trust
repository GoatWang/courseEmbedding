Important Information

 

This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Investors should read it carefully before investing.


iShares Silver Trust (the “Silver Trust”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents the Silver Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting www.iShares.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Silver Trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-800-474-2737. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Because shares of the Trust are intended to reflect the price of the silver held by the Trust, the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting silver prices. Additionally, shares of the Trust are bought and sold at market price, not at net asset value ("NAV"). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Shares of the Trust are intended to reflect, at any given time, the market price of silver owned by the Trust at that time less the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The price received upon the sale of shares of the Trust, which trade at market price, may be more or less than the value of the silver represented by such shares. If an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists, such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares. For a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the Trust, carefully read the prospectus. Following an investment in the Trust, several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of silver and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares. Among them: (i) A change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the price of silver. Silver is used in a wide range of industrial applications, and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, consequently, its price and the price of the shares. (ii) A significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards silver. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards silver, a decline in world silver prices could occur, negatively impacting the price of the shares. (iii) A significant increase in silver price hedging activity by silver producers. Traditionally, silver producers have not hedged to the same extent as other producers of precious metals (gold, for example) do. Should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of silver producing companies, it could cause a decline in world silver prices, adversely affecting the price of the shares. Silver Spot Prices provided by The Bullion Desk. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades. Although shares of the Trust may be bought or sold on the secondary market through any brokerage account, shares are not redeemable except in large aggregated units called "Baskets". Only registered broker-dealers that become authorized participants by entering into a contract with the sponsor and the trustee of the Trust may purchase or redeem Baskets. The amount of silver represented by shares of the Trust will decrease over the life of the Trust due to sales of silver necessary to pay the sponsor's fee and Trust expenses. Without increases in the price of silver sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the shares will also decline, and investors will lose money on their investment in the shares. The Trust will have limited duration. The liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trust's silver will result in losses to investors. Although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the NAV and the trading price of Trust shares through arbitrage opportunities, there is no guarantee that they will do so. There is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares, which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares. The value of the shares of the Trust will be adversely affected if silver owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the Trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss. Shares of the Trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by BlackRock, Inc., and its affiliates. An investment in the Trust is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. When comparing commodities and the Trust, it should be remembered that the sponsor's fee associated with the Trust is not borne by investors in individual commodities. Buying and selling shares of the Trust will result in brokerage commissions. Because the expenses involved in an investment in physical silver will be dispersed among all holders of shares of the Trust, an investment in the Trust may represent a cost-efficient alternative to investments in silver for investors not otherwise able to participate directly in the market for physical silver. Net Asset Value (NAV) is determined as specified in the prospectus: the iShares Silver Trust's silver and other assets are valued on the basis of each day's announced LBMA Silver Price, the price of an ounce of silver based on electronic, auction-based platform from CME Group and Thomson Reuters, minus all accrued fees, expenses and liabilities.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading.

Silver exchange-traded product

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Silver exchange-traded products are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and closed-end funds (CEFs) that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges. The U.S Geological Survey cites the emergence of silver ETFs as a significant factor in the 2007-2011 price rise of silver. As of September 2011, the largest of these funds holds the equivalent of over one third of the world's total annual silver production.

Products[edit]
Physically backed funds[edit]

Central Fund of Canada (TSX: CEF.NV.A, NYSE MKT: CEF) and Silver Bullion Trust (TSX: SBT.UN, SBT.U) are closed-end funds created by the same Canadian founders and mandated to keep the bulk of their net assets in precious metals, with a small percentage of cash. The Central Fund of Canada holds a mix of gold and silver, while the Silver Bullion Trust holds only silver. The Central Fund of Canada and Silver Bullion Trust initial public offerings were completed in 1961 and 2009 respectively.[1][2]
iShares Silver Trust (NYSE Arca: SLV) was launched by iShares in April 2006. As of November 2010, iShares Silver Trust is the largest silver ETF on the market with over 335 million troy ounces of silver in storage.[3]
ETFS Physical Silver (LSE: PHAG, PHSP) was launched by ETF Securities in April 2007 and is backed by allocated silver bullion.[4] ETF Securities have since launched physical silver ETFs on multiple exchanges around the world including Paris (Euronext: PHAG), Australia (ASX: ETP), New York (NYSE Arca: SIVR) and Tokyo (TYO: 1673). ETFS Physical Silver is backed by allocated bullion in the form of LBMA bars held with a custodian, HSBC Bank USA, and audited twice a year by an independent third party, Inspectorate International Ltd.[5][6]
ZKB Silver ETF (SIX: ZSIL, ZSILEU, ZSILUS) was launched by Zürcher Kantonalbank in May 2007 and invests exclusively in physical silver.[7]
Claymore Silver Bullion Trust (TSX: SVR.UN) is a closed-end fund created by Claymore Investments. The initial public offering was completed on July 15, 2009.[8]
Julius Baer Physical Silver Fund (SIX: JBSICA, JBSIEA, JBSIUA, JBSIGA) was launched by Swiss & Global Asset Management (formerly Julius Baer Asset Management) in January 2010.[9]

Boost provides a range of 3x commodity and equity short and leveraged ETFs. In Silver as well as Gold Boost offers 3x leveraged and short versions listed on the London Stock Exchange. The products are fully collateralized and have multiple market makers who will offer deep and liquid markets. GBP quoted versions also exist.

PureFunds ISE Junior Silver (Small Cap Miners/Explorers) (NYSE Arca: SILJ) was launched in November, 2012, and is designed to track the performance of the ISE Junior Silver Index, less investor fees.
ETFS Silver (LSE: SLVR) was launched by ETF Securities in September 2006 and tracks the DJ-UBS Silver Sub-Index
db Physical Silver ETC (SIX: XSIL, LSE: XSIL, FWB: XAD6) was launched by Deutsche Bank in July 2010.[11][12]
PowerShares DB Silver (NYSE Arca: DBS), an ETF which holds primarily futures contracts for physical delivery, which are later sold to silver consumers in order to roll over expiring contracts to contracts further from expiration. ProShares Ultra Silver (NYSE Arca: AGQ), seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to twice (200%) the daily performance of silver bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar fixing price for delivery in London. ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE Arca: ZSL) in the corresponding 2x inverse ETF.

Horizons BetaPro COMEX Silver ETF (TSX: HUZ) aims to correspond to the performance of the COMEX silver futures contract for a subsequent delivery month.

Risks[edit]
Each silver ETF, ETN, and CEF has a different structure outlined in its prospectus. Such instruments do not necessarily hold physical silver. For example, silver ETNs generally track the price of silver using derivatives. All exchange-traded silver instruments, including those that hold physical silver for the benefit of the investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. The most popular silver ETF (iShares Silver Trust, symbol SLV) has been compared with mortgage-backed securities due to its complexity.[13]

UBS E-TRACS CMCI Silver Total Return (NYSE Arca: USV and LSE: SILG) is designed to track the performance of the UBS Bloomberg CMCI Silver Total Return, less investor fees.
Horizons BetaPro COMEX Silver ETF (TSX: HUZ) aims to correspond to the performance of the COMEX silver futures contract for a subsequent delivery month.

Risks[edit]
Each silver ETF, ETN, and CEF has a different structure outlined in its prospectus. Such instruments do not necessarily hold physical silver. For example, silver ETNs generally track the price of silver using derivatives. All exchange-traded silver instruments, including those that hold physical silver for the benefit of the investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. The most popular silver ETF (iShares Silver Trust, symbol SLV) has been compared with mortgage-backed securities due to its complexity.[13]

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.
