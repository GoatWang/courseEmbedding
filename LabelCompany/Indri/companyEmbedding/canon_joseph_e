1Description







The FotodioX Pro Canon EF Lens to Samsung NX-Mount Camera Adapter with Tripod Mount is a high quality adapter that allows you to mount a Canon EF mount lens to a Samsung NX camera body. It features a brass construction with a stainless steel finish as well as the ability to focus to infinity. This works with a leaf spring system for a secure attachment of the lens to the adapter. Additionally, this adapter features a tripod mount for security when using larger lenses.  Although the lens will fit physically, automatic lens control and functions will not operate correctly while using this adapter. You can utilize aperture priority mode in combination with stop-down metering for automatic exposure control on your camera.

1Description







The FotodioX Pro Canon EF Lens to Samsung NX-Mount Camera Adapter with Tripod Mount is a high quality adapter that allows you to mount a Canon EF mount lens to a Samsung NX camera body. It features a brass construction with a stainless steel finish as well as the ability to focus to infinity. This works with a leaf spring system for a secure attachment of the lens to the adapter. Additionally, this adapter features a tripod mount for security when using larger lenses.  Although the lens will fit physically, automatic lens control and functions will not operate correctly while using this adapter. You can utilize aperture priority mode in combination with stop-down metering for automatic exposure control on your camera.

DetailsSynopsisThis book is about marketing and marketing strategy planning., This book is about marketing and marketing strategy planning. At its essence, marketing strategy planning is about figuring out how to do a superior job of satisfying customers. This author team takes that point of view seriously and believes in practicing what they preach. Instructors and students can trust that this new edition of "Essentials of Marketing" 13e and all of the other teaching and learning materials that accompany it will satisfy every instructor and students needs. Building on Pioneering Strengths This author team pioneered an innovative structure using the four Ps with a managerial approach for the introductory marketing course. It quickly became one of the most widely used business textbooks ever published because it organized the best ideas about marketing so that readers could both understand and apply them. The unifying focus of these ideas is on how to make the marketing decisions that a manager must make in deciding what customers to target and how best to meet their needs. Over many editions of "Basic Marketing" and "Essentials of Marketing," there have been constant changes in marketing management and the marketing environment. Some of the changes have been dramatic, and others have been subtle. As a result, the authors have made ongoing changes to the text to reflect marketing s best practices and ideas. What's different about "Essentials of Marketing"? The success of this franchise is not the result of a single strength or one long-lasting innovation. Other text books have adopted the four Ps framework and the Perreault author team has continuously improved the book. The text s four Ps framework, managerial orientation, and strategy planning focus have proven to be foundational pillars that are remarkably robust for supporting new developments in the field and innovations in the text and package. "Essentials of Marketing" teaches students analytical abilities and how-to-do-it skills that prepare them for success. The author team has deliberately included a variety of examples, explanations, frameworks, models, classification systems, cases, and how-to-do-it techniques that relate to our overall framework for marketing strategy planning. Similarly, the "Marketing Plan Coach" on the text website helps students see how to create marketing plans. Taken together, these items speed the development of marketing sense and enable the student to analyze marketing situations and develop marketing plans in a confident and meaningful way. They are practical and they work. As opposed to many other marketing text books, the authors emphasize careful integration of special topics. Some textbooks treat special topics like relationship marketing, international marketing, services marketing, marketing and the Internet, marketing for nonprofit organizations, marketing ethics, social issues, and business-to-business marketing in separate chapters. The authors deliberatively avoid doing that because they are convinced that treating such topics separately leads to an unfortunate compartmentalization of ideas. The comprehensive package of materials gives instructors the flexibility to "teach marketing their way"- or for the student, the ability to "learn marketing their way.""SizeLength:10.8 inHeight:0.8 inWidth:8.4 inWeight:50 oz

      Updated July 2017    

      Best Canon DSLR Cameras    







            Best of the Best          


 




            Canon          

            EOS 5D Mark IV          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            A top-of-the-line DSLR that takes superb photos and video and includes an articulating touchscreen that users love. The best of breed.          



            Pros          

            Superb autofocusing features, including a Servo AI mode that can track a subject as it moves across the scene. Users also loved the ability to transfer photos wirelessly as well as the onscreen assistance for the camera's various modes.          



            Cons          

            Expensive. Some users complained that they had difficulty getting a sharp viewfinder image.           







 




            Canon          

            EOS 70D          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            An excellent mid-range DSLR that many users rely on primarily for video recording.          



            Pros          

            Shoots excellent video with good sound and excellent auto-focus in video mode.           



            Cons          

            Enough users cited reliability issues, such as dead pixels and even more significant repairs, to warrant caution.          







 




            Canon          

            EOS Rebel T5i           



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            A competent entry-level camera that doesn't offer much in the way of unique features to separate it from the pack.           



            Pros          

            Lightweight camera with most of the basic features of more pricey cameras. Not only does it have a tilt-out touchscreen, but it is very easy for beginners to master.           



            Cons          

            Some users complain that the autofocus is a bit sluggish; the video quality also suffers, especially in low light.            







 




            Canon          

            EOS Rebel SL1           



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            A powerful and lightweight entry-level DSLR that takes excellent photos but might not be the best choice if you plan to do a lot of video.           



            Pros          

            The smallest DSLR on the market; users rave that it's so lightweight that their bag feels empty. Even so, it delivers exposure controls and image quality similar to other Canon models.          



            Cons          

            Short battery life limits the amount of video you can shoot. Some users also complain about low light performance and distracting chromatic aberration in some situations.          






            Best Bang for the Buck          


 




            Canon          

            EOS Rebel T6           



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            The best choice for anyone new to DSLRs or looking for a lightweight camera – it contains all the essential DSLR features packed into a tiny package.          



            Pros          

            An on-screen "feature guide" helps newbies understand the various camera modes and settings; it also connects to Android devices so you can use a phone as a remote control.           



            Cons          

            Integrated Wi-Fi only works with mobile devices, not PCs. Some users also complained about inaccurate color reproduction.

            123inkjets is probably the best place in american to order re-inked inkjet cartridges. i use them in all my epson printers and i am highly satisfied. the savings alone has allowed my to purchase the newer epson surecolor p800 and i hope 123inkjets will have cartridges for them soon!- Dr. M, 6/26/2017

What our customers have to say...


            123inkjets is probably the best place in american to order re-inked inkjet cartridges. i use them in all my epson printers and i am highly satisfied. the savings alone has allowed my to purchase the newer epson surecolor p800 and i hope 123inkjets will have cartridges for them soon!- Dr. M, 6/26/2017 

            I like the idea of getting the refill kits, which i hope will make life and productivity a affordable options- Office lg, 6/26/2017 

            I really like the sales at 123 inkjets as they have always pleased me.- CherylC, 6/26/2017 

            Have ordered ink from them many times and have never been disappointed.- Annie Orange, 6/17/2017 

            I really like 123inkjets! with every purchase, i am amazed at the value i get from them considering the price. and when i have needed to call to get information, whom ever i speak to, has always been so helpful and pleasant! oh and anyone i notice anywhere, that is looking for/at ink cartridge replacements, i spontaneously suggest they might consider looking into 123inkjets online for their replacements, not only because of the great quality and good customer service, but also the quickness of the cartridges being delivered. i live in the tehachapi mountains of california, so that makes for few choices to find replacements up here, thus the cost up here reflecting "bigger demand with few places to choose from" pricing! :-)- Terry, 6/17/2017 

            Easy to find what i need. entire process from search to check out in less than 5 minutes- Inky123, 6/14/2017 

            I appreciate having a convenient way of shopping for critical items which are delivered in a timely manner.- Thankful, 6/14/2017 

            I have used 123inkjets many times. i am always satisfied with the product and the service for my onlne orders. i will continue to use them in the future and have and will again recommend them to friends and associates.- DianaB59, 6/14/2017

            I have been using 123 injets for at least 6 years and i am very satified with the products and prices- Dbald8, 6/13/2017 

            It's the best to buy ink cartridges. it has such a large variety of cartridges to choose from and shipping arrives on time. plus it's got great prices. i've never been disappointed with their products and continue to use them when i need new cartridges, .- Trudy, 6/13/2017 

            My order was promptly delivered at a very reasonable price. thank you.- Hudg, 6/13/2017 

            In this day and age of non customer service, 123inkjets is a refreshing and renewed faith it still exists!!!! always helpful, always accommodating.- Happy customer, 6/12/2017 

            Ordering was painless!! order arrived before expectations. prices were/are very good. order was correct!!- "oleguy", 6/12/2017 

            I am pretty happy and satisfied with purchasing from 123 inkjets. it is so much more economical. the order was a back up for my current cartridge so i will use it when my current runs out which is soon.- Ronay, 6/11/2017 

            I was very pleased with the whole process and my order. i will order all my ink from you in the future.- Jim, 6/11/2017
