Hong Kong Television Network Limited (HKTV, Chinese: 香港電視網絡有限公司) is a Hong Kong television station. HKTV provides an over-the-top shopping and entertainment ("shoppertainment") platform named HKTV Mall.[2] It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 2014 through live broadcasting and video on demand.
Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013.[3] Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence.[4]

Background[edit]
Hong Kong Television Network Limited (formerly known as City Telecom) is a listed company in Hong Kong (HKEx: 1137). Founded in 1992, CTI (HK) has had extensive and successful experiences in the liberalisation of the telecommunications business and the application and renown of advanced technology. Hong Kong Television aims to provide a variety of programmes to cater and entertain customers.
History[edit]
Before launch[edit]
In January 2013, City Telecom took on the name HKTV.[5]
After submission of application for a domestic free television programme service licence in 2009, HKTV invested about HK$300 million and hired several hundred staff to produce TV series, and planned to invest HK$600 million into a new Television Production Centre at Tsueng Kwan O Industrial Estate.[6] Moreover, it released some trailers of the TV series on YouTube, which received mostly positive feedback. It planned to start broadcasting with six channels, and eventually expand to 30 in six years.[1]
The licence application was rejected by the Hong Kong Government on 15 October 2013 amidst competition from television operators Fantastic Television and Hong Kong Television Entertainment.[7] The government quoted 'gradual and orderly approach' as the sole reason for its decision and invited HKTV to challenge it in court by judicial review. There was a strong outcry against the decision from the general public.




The staff of HKTV and the public protested on the Civic Square outside the Central Government Offices against the government's decision to deny HKTV's application.


On 20 October 2013, five days after the rejection of HKTV's TV licence application, crowds of protesters in black T-shirts including the staff of HKTV marched to request the government to issue the licence and demand an explanation.[8] HKTV suggested that 80,000 people took part in the protest, while the police claimed that only 36,000 people joined. Protesters chanted "Stop monopoly in the TV market" as they thought that TVB was monopolising the market and they said "Stop black box politics" because the policy made by the Executive Council is not transparent to the public. The Facebook page that organised the march received about 500,000 "likes" within one week.[9][10]
On 21 December 2013 HKTV acquired mobile TV licence and spectrum from CMHK, and planned to relaunch UTV on 1 July 2014 as HKTV.[11] It also planned to broadcast through over-the-top format.
On 6 January 2014, HKTV has filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the Government's decision in rejecting HKTV's application for a domestic free TV programme service licence.[12] which was accepted by the High Court.
On 11 April 2014, HKTV appealed for the judicial review on the broadcasting format of the Mobile Television service, which was accepted by the High Court.[13][14] Meanwhile, HKTV applied again to the Communication Authority for the free Television Broadcasting license.[15] Moreover, HKTV proposed to establish an online shopping center before the end of 2014, where customers can watch the new program produced continuously by HKTV.[16]
In May 2014, HKTV planned to launch an online shopping website. The completed TV shows were planned to broadcast on this website to attract more local companies to get into this online business. The target group of HKTV online shopping website was the annual salary more than 250,000 middle-class family. However, HKTV remained running free TV business as their most important task. Operating e-commerce only aims to obtain funds to maintain the company.[17]
Launch[edit]
In late October 2014, HKTV launched a voting online to vote for their favourite TV series among sixteen, and the winner will be broadcast on 19 November 2014.[18]
On 19 November 2014, HKTV officially launched its channel, the same day Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) started to broadcast in 1967. The main income is the advertisement between 12–13 hours programmes.[19][20] At the early stage of its broadcasting, HKTV uploaded 2 hours drama, half an hour variety shows, plus 4 hours programmes every day.
After launch, HKTV was exploring new business opportunities, including e-commerce, by consolidating mobile TV spectrum and over-the-top Internet platforms. Leveraging on the strong brand presence and programme library of HKTV, it aims to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products & services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shopping and round-the-clock services.
On 24 April 2015, the High Court ruled the rejection of HKTV's application as unlawful: when the Executive Council switched to a policy that limits the numbers of licences, it failed to follow the policy which encourages competition within the broadcasting industry as set forth in 1998. The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.[4]
Platforms[edit]
HKTV supports multiple platforms: personal computers, smart televisions, television boxes, smartphones and tablet computers.[21] All smart TVs which are produced in and after 2012 can subscribe to the HKTV channel; Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony televisions allow their users to watch HKTV programmes through an application downloaded from the TV markets. Users of Android and iOS smartphones and tablet computers can download apps from Google Play Store and the App Store respectively.[22][23] Besides, HKTV has planned to open more channels on Internet, smartphone, and set top box etc.
Productions[edit]
By 31 August 2014, HKTV had produced 190 dramas, 70 variety shows and over 1000 hours' programmes.[24]

Hong Kong Television Network Limited (HKTV, Chinese: 香港電視網絡有限公司) is a Hong Kong television station. HKTV provides an over-the-top shopping and entertainment ("shoppertainment") platform named HKTV Mall.[2] It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 2014 through live broadcasting and video on demand.
Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013.[3] Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence.[4]

Background[edit]
Hong Kong Television Network Limited (formerly known as City Telecom) is a listed company in Hong Kong (HKEx: 1137). Founded in 1992, CTI (HK) has had extensive and successful experiences in the liberalisation of the telecommunications business and the application and renown of advanced technology. Hong Kong Television aims to provide a variety of programmes to cater and entertain customers.
History[edit]
Before launch[edit]
In January 2013, City Telecom took on the name HKTV.[5]
After submission of application for a domestic free television programme service licence in 2009, HKTV invested about HK$300 million and hired several hundred staff to produce TV series, and planned to invest HK$600 million into a new Television Production Centre at Tsueng Kwan O Industrial Estate.[6] Moreover, it released some trailers of the TV series on YouTube, which received mostly positive feedback. It planned to start broadcasting with six channels, and eventually expand to 30 in six years.[1]
The licence application was rejected by the Hong Kong Government on 15 October 2013 amidst competition from television operators Fantastic Television and Hong Kong Television Entertainment.[7] The government quoted 'gradual and orderly approach' as the sole reason for its decision and invited HKTV to challenge it in court by judicial review. There was a strong outcry against the decision from the general public.




The staff of HKTV and the public protested on the Civic Square outside the Central Government Offices against the government's decision to deny HKTV's application.


On 20 October 2013, five days after the rejection of HKTV's TV licence application, crowds of protesters in black T-shirts including the staff of HKTV marched to request the government to issue the licence and demand an explanation.[8] HKTV suggested that 80,000 people took part in the protest, while the police claimed that only 36,000 people joined. Protesters chanted "Stop monopoly in the TV market" as they thought that TVB was monopolising the market and they said "Stop black box politics" because the policy made by the Executive Council is not transparent to the public. The Facebook page that organised the march received about 500,000 "likes" within one week.[9][10]
On 21 December 2013 HKTV acquired mobile TV licence and spectrum from CMHK, and planned to relaunch UTV on 1 July 2014 as HKTV.[11] It also planned to broadcast through over-the-top format.
On 6 January 2014, HKTV has filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the Government's decision in rejecting HKTV's application for a domestic free TV programme service licence.[12] which was accepted by the High Court.
On 11 April 2014, HKTV appealed for the judicial review on the broadcasting format of the Mobile Television service, which was accepted by the High Court.[13][14] Meanwhile, HKTV applied again to the Communication Authority for the free Television Broadcasting license.[15] Moreover, HKTV proposed to establish an online shopping center before the end of 2014, where customers can watch the new program produced continuously by HKTV.[16]
In May 2014, HKTV planned to launch an online shopping website. The completed TV shows were planned to broadcast on this website to attract more local companies to get into this online business. The target group of HKTV online shopping website was the annual salary more than 250,000 middle-class family. However, HKTV remained running free TV business as their most important task. Operating e-commerce only aims to obtain funds to maintain the company.[17]
Launch[edit]
In late October 2014, HKTV launched a voting online to vote for their favourite TV series among sixteen, and the winner will be broadcast on 19 November 2014.[18]
On 19 November 2014, HKTV officially launched its channel, the same day Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) started to broadcast in 1967. The main income is the advertisement between 12–13 hours programmes.[19][20] At the early stage of its broadcasting, HKTV uploaded 2 hours drama, half an hour variety shows, plus 4 hours programmes every day.
After launch, HKTV was exploring new business opportunities, including e-commerce, by consolidating mobile TV spectrum and over-the-top Internet platforms. Leveraging on the strong brand presence and programme library of HKTV, it aims to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products & services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shopping and round-the-clock services.
On 24 April 2015, the High Court ruled the rejection of HKTV's application as unlawful: when the Executive Council switched to a policy that limits the numbers of licences, it failed to follow the policy which encourages competition within the broadcasting industry as set forth in 1998. The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.[4]
Platforms[edit]
HKTV supports multiple platforms: personal computers, smart televisions, television boxes, smartphones and tablet computers.[21] All smart TVs which are produced in and after 2012 can subscribe to the HKTV channel; Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony televisions allow their users to watch HKTV programmes through an application downloaded from the TV markets. Users of Android and iOS smartphones and tablet computers can download apps from Google Play Store and the App Store respectively.[22][23] Besides, HKTV has planned to open more channels on Internet, smartphone, and set top box etc.
Productions[edit]
By 31 August 2014, HKTV had produced 190 dramas, 70 variety shows and over 1000 hours' programmes.[24]

Hong Kong Television Network Limited (HKTV, Chinese: 香港電視網絡有限公司) is a Hong Kong television station. HKTV provides an over-the-top shopping and entertainment ("shoppertainment") platform named HKTV Mall.[2] It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 2014 through live broadcasting and video on demand.
Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013.[3] Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence.[4]

Background[edit]
Hong Kong Television Network Limited (formerly known as City Telecom) is a listed company in Hong Kong (HKEx: 1137). Founded in 1992, CTI (HK) has had extensive and successful experiences in the liberalisation of the telecommunications business and the application and renown of advanced technology. Hong Kong Television aims to provide a variety of programmes to cater and entertain customers.
History[edit]
Before launch[edit]
In January 2013, City Telecom took on the name HKTV.[5]
After submission of application for a domestic free television programme service licence in 2009, HKTV invested about HK$300 million and hired several hundred staff to produce TV series, and planned to invest HK$600 million into a new Television Production Centre at Tsueng Kwan O Industrial Estate.[6] Moreover, it released some trailers of the TV series on YouTube, which received mostly positive feedback. It planned to start broadcasting with six channels, and eventually expand to 30 in six years.[1]
The licence application was rejected by the Hong Kong Government on 15 October 2013 amidst competition from television operators Fantastic Television and Hong Kong Television Entertainment.[7] The government quoted 'gradual and orderly approach' as the sole reason for its decision and invited HKTV to challenge it in court by judicial review. There was a strong outcry against the decision from the general public.




The staff of HKTV and the public protested on the Civic Square outside the Central Government Offices against the government's decision to deny HKTV's application.


On 20 October 2013, five days after the rejection of HKTV's TV licence application, crowds of protesters in black T-shirts including the staff of HKTV marched to request the government to issue the licence and demand an explanation.[8] HKTV suggested that 80,000 people took part in the protest, while the police claimed that only 36,000 people joined. Protesters chanted "Stop monopoly in the TV market" as they thought that TVB was monopolising the market and they said "Stop black box politics" because the policy made by the Executive Council is not transparent to the public. The Facebook page that organised the march received about 500,000 "likes" within one week.[9][10]
On 21 December 2013 HKTV acquired mobile TV licence and spectrum from CMHK, and planned to relaunch UTV on 1 July 2014 as HKTV.[11] It also planned to broadcast through over-the-top format.
On 6 January 2014, HKTV has filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the Government's decision in rejecting HKTV's application for a domestic free TV programme service licence.[12] which was accepted by the High Court.
On 11 April 2014, HKTV appealed for the judicial review on the broadcasting format of the Mobile Television service, which was accepted by the High Court.[13][14] Meanwhile, HKTV applied again to the Communication Authority for the free Television Broadcasting license.[15] Moreover, HKTV proposed to establish an online shopping center before the end of 2014, where customers can watch the new program produced continuously by HKTV.[16]
In May 2014, HKTV planned to launch an online shopping website. The completed TV shows were planned to broadcast on this website to attract more local companies to get into this online business. The target group of HKTV online shopping website was the annual salary more than 250,000 middle-class family. However, HKTV remained running free TV business as their most important task. Operating e-commerce only aims to obtain funds to maintain the company.[17]
Launch[edit]
In late October 2014, HKTV launched a voting online to vote for their favourite TV series among sixteen, and the winner will be broadcast on 19 November 2014.[18]
On 19 November 2014, HKTV officially launched its channel, the same day Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) started to broadcast in 1967. The main income is the advertisement between 12–13 hours programmes.[19][20] At the early stage of its broadcasting, HKTV uploaded 2 hours drama, half an hour variety shows, plus 4 hours programmes every day.
After launch, HKTV was exploring new business opportunities, including e-commerce, by consolidating mobile TV spectrum and over-the-top Internet platforms. Leveraging on the strong brand presence and programme library of HKTV, it aims to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products & services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shopping and round-the-clock services.
On 24 April 2015, the High Court ruled the rejection of HKTV's application as unlawful: when the Executive Council switched to a policy that limits the numbers of licences, it failed to follow the policy which encourages competition within the broadcasting industry as set forth in 1998. The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.[4]
Platforms[edit]
HKTV supports multiple platforms: personal computers, smart televisions, television boxes, smartphones and tablet computers.[21] All smart TVs which are produced in and after 2012 can subscribe to the HKTV channel; Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony televisions allow their users to watch HKTV programmes through an application downloaded from the TV markets. Users of Android and iOS smartphones and tablet computers can download apps from Google Play Store and the App Store respectively.[22][23] Besides, HKTV has planned to open more channels on Internet, smartphone, and set top box etc.

By 31 August 2014, HKTV had produced 190 dramas, 70 variety shows and over 1000 hours' programmes.[24]

Hong Kong Television Network Limited (HKTV, Chinese: 香港電視網絡有限公司) is a Hong Kong television station. HKTV provides an over-the-top shopping and entertainment ("shoppertainment") platform named HKTV Mall.[2] It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 2014 through live broadcasting and video on demand.
Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013.[3] Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence.[4]

Background[edit]
Hong Kong Television Network Limited (formerly known as City Telecom) is a listed company in Hong Kong (HKEx: 1137). Founded in 1992, CTI (HK) has had extensive and successful experiences in the liberalisation of the telecommunications business and the application and renown of advanced technology. Hong Kong Television aims to provide a variety of programmes to cater and entertain customers.
History[edit]
Before launch[edit]
In January 2013, City Telecom took on the name HKTV.[5]
After submission of application for a domestic free television programme service licence in 2009, HKTV invested about HK$300 million and hired several hundred staff to produce TV series, and planned to invest HK$600 million into a new Television Production Centre at Tsueng Kwan O Industrial Estate.[6] Moreover, it released some trailers of the TV series on YouTube, which received mostly positive feedback. It planned to start broadcasting with six channels, and eventually expand to 30 in six years.[1]
The licence application was rejected by the Hong Kong Government on 15 October 2013 amidst competition from television operators Fantastic Television and Hong Kong Television Entertainment.[7] The government quoted 'gradual and orderly approach' as the sole reason for its decision and invited HKTV to challenge it in court by judicial review. There was a strong outcry against the decision from the general public.




The staff of HKTV and the public protested on the Civic Square outside the Central Government Offices against the government's decision to deny HKTV's application.


On 20 October 2013, five days after the rejection of HKTV's TV licence application, crowds of protesters in black T-shirts including the staff of HKTV marched to request the government to issue the licence and demand an explanation.[8] HKTV suggested that 80,000 people took part in the protest, while the police claimed that only 36,000 people joined. Protesters chanted "Stop monopoly in the TV market" as they thought that TVB was monopolising the market and they said "Stop black box politics" because the policy made by the Executive Council is not transparent to the public. The Facebook page that organised the march received about 500,000 "likes" within one week.[9][10]
On 21 December 2013 HKTV acquired mobile TV licence and spectrum from CMHK, and planned to relaunch UTV on 1 July 2014 as HKTV.[11] It also planned to broadcast through over-the-top format.
On 6 January 2014, HKTV has filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the Government's decision in rejecting HKTV's application for a domestic free TV programme service licence.[12] which was accepted by the High Court.
On 11 April 2014, HKTV appealed for the judicial review on the broadcasting format of the Mobile Television service, which was accepted by the High Court.[13][14] Meanwhile, HKTV applied again to the Communication Authority for the free Television Broadcasting license.[15] Moreover, HKTV proposed to establish an online shopping center before the end of 2014, where customers can watch the new program produced continuously by HKTV.[16]
In May 2014, HKTV planned to launch an online shopping website. The completed TV shows were planned to broadcast on this website to attract more local companies to get into this online business. The target group of HKTV online shopping website was the annual salary more than 250,000 middle-class family. However, HKTV remained running free TV business as their most important task. Operating e-commerce only aims to obtain funds to maintain the company.[17]
Launch[edit]
In late October 2014, HKTV launched a voting online to vote for their favourite TV series among sixteen, and the winner will be broadcast on 19 November 2014.[18]
On 19 November 2014, HKTV officially launched its channel, the same day Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) started to broadcast in 1967. The main income is the advertisement between 12–13 hours programmes.[19][20] At the early stage of its broadcasting, HKTV uploaded 2 hours drama, half an hour variety shows, plus 4 hours programmes every day.
After launch, HKTV was exploring new business opportunities, including e-commerce, by consolidating mobile TV spectrum and over-the-top Internet platforms. Leveraging on the strong brand presence and programme library of HKTV, it aims to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products & services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shopping and round-the-clock services.
On 24 April 2015, the High Court ruled the rejection of HKTV's application as unlawful: when the Executive Council switched to a policy that limits the numbers of licences, it failed to follow the policy which encourages competition within the broadcasting industry as set forth in 1998. The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.[4]
Platforms[edit]
HKTV supports multiple platforms: personal computers, smart televisions, television boxes, smartphones and tablet computers.[21] All smart TVs which are produced in and after 2012 can subscribe to the HKTV channel; Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony televisions allow their users to watch HKTV programmes through an application downloaded from the TV markets. Users of Android and iOS smartphones and tablet computers can download apps from Google Play Store and the App Store respectively.[22][23] Besides, HKTV has planned to open more channels on Internet, smartphone, and set top box etc.

Hong Kong Television Network Limited (HKTV, Chinese: 香港電視網絡有限公司) is a Hong Kong television station. HKTV provides an over-the-top shopping and entertainment ("shoppertainment") platform named HKTV Mall.[2] It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 2014 through live broadcasting and video on demand.
Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013.[3] Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence.[4]

Background[edit]
Hong Kong Television Network Limited (formerly known as City Telecom) is a listed company in Hong Kong (HKEx: 1137). Founded in 1992, CTI (HK) has had extensive and successful experiences in the liberalisation of the telecommunications business and the application and renown of advanced technology. Hong Kong Television aims to provide a variety of programmes to cater and entertain customers.
History[edit]
Before launch[edit]
In January 2013, City Telecom took on the name HKTV.[5]
After submission of application for a domestic free television programme service licence in 2009, HKTV invested about HK$300 million and hired several hundred staff to produce TV series, and planned to invest HK$600 million into a new Television Production Centre at Tsueng Kwan O Industrial Estate.[6] Moreover, it released some trailers of the TV series on YouTube, which received mostly positive feedback. It planned to start broadcasting with six channels, and eventually expand to 30 in six years.[1]
The licence application was rejected by the Hong Kong Government on 15 October 2013 amidst competition from television operators Fantastic Television and Hong Kong Television Entertainment.[7] The government quoted 'gradual and orderly approach' as the sole reason for its decision and invited HKTV to challenge it in court by judicial review. There was a strong outcry against the decision from the general public.




The staff of HKTV and the public protested on the Civic Square outside the Central Government Offices against the government's decision to deny HKTV's application.


On 20 October 2013, five days after the rejection of HKTV's TV licence application, crowds of protesters in black T-shirts including the staff of HKTV marched to request the government to issue the licence and demand an explanation.[8] HKTV suggested that 80,000 people took part in the protest, while the police claimed that only 36,000 people joined. Protesters chanted "Stop monopoly in the TV market" as they thought that TVB was monopolising the market and they said "Stop black box politics" because the policy made by the Executive Council is not transparent to the public. The Facebook page that organised the march received about 500,000 "likes" within one week.[9][10]
On 21 December 2013 HKTV acquired mobile TV licence and spectrum from CMHK, and planned to relaunch UTV on 1 July 2014 as HKTV.[11] It also planned to broadcast through over-the-top format.
On 6 January 2014, HKTV has filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the Government's decision in rejecting HKTV's application for a domestic free TV programme service licence.[12] which was accepted by the High Court.
On 11 April 2014, HKTV appealed for the judicial review on the broadcasting format of the Mobile Television service, which was accepted by the High Court.[13][14] Meanwhile, HKTV applied again to the Communication Authority for the free Television Broadcasting license.[15] Moreover, HKTV proposed to establish an online shopping center before the end of 2014, where customers can watch the new program produced continuously by HKTV.[16]
In May 2014, HKTV planned to launch an online shopping website. The completed TV shows were planned to broadcast on this website to attract more local companies to get into this online business. The target group of HKTV online shopping website was the annual salary more than 250,000 middle-class family. However, HKTV remained running free TV business as their most important task. Operating e-commerce only aims to obtain funds to maintain the company.[17]
Launch[edit]
In late October 2014, HKTV launched a voting online to vote for their favourite TV series among sixteen, and the winner will be broadcast on 19 November 2014.[18]
On 19 November 2014, HKTV officially launched its channel, the same day Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) started to broadcast in 1967. The main income is the advertisement between 12–13 hours programmes.[19][20] At the early stage of its broadcasting, HKTV uploaded 2 hours drama, half an hour variety shows, plus 4 hours programmes every day.
After launch, HKTV was exploring new business opportunities, including e-commerce, by consolidating mobile TV spectrum and over-the-top Internet platforms. Leveraging on the strong brand presence and programme library of HKTV, it aims to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products & services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shopping and round-the-clock services.

The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.[4]
Platforms[edit]
HKTV supports multiple platforms: personal computers, smart televisions, television boxes, smartphones and tablet computers.[21] All smart TVs which are produced in and after 2012 can subscribe to the HKTV channel; Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony televisions allow their users to watch HKTV programmes through an application downloaded from the TV markets. Users of Android and iOS smartphones and tablet computers can download apps from Google Play Store and the App Store respectively.[22][23] Besides, HKTV has planned to open more channels on Internet, smartphone, and set top box etc.

Background[edit]
Hong Kong Television Network Limited (formerly known as City Telecom) is a listed company in Hong Kong (HKEx: 1137). Founded in 1992, CTI (HK) has had extensive and successful experiences in the liberalisation of the telecommunications business and the application and renown of advanced technology. Hong Kong Television aims to provide a variety of programmes to cater and entertain customers.
History[edit]
Before launch[edit]
In January 2013, City Telecom took on the name HKTV.[5]
After submission of application for a domestic free television programme service licence in 2009, HKTV invested about HK$300 million and hired several hundred staff to produce TV series, and planned to invest HK$600 million into a new Television Production Centre at Tsueng Kwan O Industrial Estate.[6] Moreover, it released some trailers of the TV series on YouTube, which received mostly positive feedback. It planned to start broadcasting with six channels, and eventually expand to 30 in six years.[1]
The licence application was rejected by the Hong Kong Government on 15 October 2013 amidst competition from television operators Fantastic Television and Hong Kong Television Entertainment.[7] The government quoted 'gradual and orderly approach' as the sole reason for its decision and invited HKTV to challenge it in court by judicial review. There was a strong outcry against the decision from the general public.




The staff of HKTV and the public protested on the Civic Square outside the Central Government Offices against the government's decision to deny HKTV's application.


On 20 October 2013, five days after the rejection of HKTV's TV licence application, crowds of protesters in black T-shirts including the staff of HKTV marched to request the government to issue the licence and demand an explanation.[8] HKTV suggested that 80,000 people took part in the protest, while the police claimed that only 36,000 people joined. Protesters chanted "Stop monopoly in the TV market" as they thought that TVB was monopolising the market and they said "Stop black box politics" because the policy made by the Executive Council is not transparent to the public. The Facebook page that organised the march received about 500,000 "likes" within one week.[9][10]
On 21 December 2013 HKTV acquired mobile TV licence and spectrum from CMHK, and planned to relaunch UTV on 1 July 2014 as HKTV.[11] It also planned to broadcast through over-the-top format.
On 6 January 2014, HKTV has filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review in respect of the Government's decision in rejecting HKTV's application for a domestic free TV programme service licence.[12] which was accepted by the High Court.
On 11 April 2014, HKTV appealed for the judicial review on the broadcasting format of the Mobile Television service, which was accepted by the High Court.[13][14] Meanwhile, HKTV applied again to the Communication Authority for the free Television Broadcasting license.[15] Moreover, HKTV proposed to establish an online shopping center before the end of 2014, where customers can watch the new program produced continuously by HKTV.[16]
In May 2014, HKTV planned to launch an online shopping website. The completed TV shows were planned to broadcast on this website to attract more local companies to get into this online business. The target group of HKTV online shopping website was the annual salary more than 250,000 middle-class family. However, HKTV remained running free TV business as their most important task. Operating e-commerce only aims to obtain funds to maintain the company.[17]
Launch[edit]
In late October 2014, HKTV launched a voting online to vote for their favourite TV series among sixteen, and the winner will be broadcast on 19 November 2014.[18]
On 19 November 2014, HKTV officially launched its channel, the same day Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) started to broadcast in 1967. The main income is the advertisement between 12–13 hours programmes.[19][20] At the early stage of its broadcasting, HKTV uploaded 2 hours drama, half an hour variety shows, plus 4 hours programmes every day.
After launch, HKTV was exploring new business opportunities, including e-commerce, by consolidating mobile TV spectrum and over-the-top Internet platforms. Leveraging on the strong brand presence and programme library of HKTV, it aims to build the largest and the most diversified in terms of brand names, products & services e-shopping mall in Hong Kong, providing one-stop shopping and round-the-clock services.
On 24 April 2015, the High Court ruled the rejection of HKTV's application as unlawful: when the Executive Council switched to a policy that limits the numbers of licences, it failed to follow the policy which encourages competition within the broadcasting industry as set forth in 1998. The court ordered the Exco to reconsider HKTV's application.[4]
Platforms[edit]
HKTV supports multiple platforms: personal computers, smart televisions, television boxes, smartphones and tablet computers.[21] All smart TVs which are produced in and after 2012 can subscribe to the HKTV channel; Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony televisions allow their users to watch HKTV programmes through an application downloaded from the TV markets. Users of Android and iOS smartphones and tablet computers can download apps from Google Play Store and the App Store respectively.[22][23] Besides, HKTV has planned to open more channels on Internet, smartphone, and set top box etc.

By 31 August 2014, HKTV had produced 190 dramas, 70 variety shows and over 1000 hours' programmes.[24]

Hong Kong Television Network Limited (HKTV, Chinese: 香港電視網絡有限公司) is a Hong Kong television station. HKTV provides an over-the-top shopping and entertainment ("shoppertainment") platform named HKTV Mall.[2] It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 2014 through live broadcasting and video on demand.
Before the commencement of its video-on-demand broadcasting, HKTV had applied for domestic free-to-air television programme service licence, but was rejected by the Hong Kong government in October 2013.[3] Later, HKTV acquired the mobile television network owned by CMHK and planned to launch the first 2 channels on 1 July 2014; however, this plan was foiled as HKTV lacked another broadcasting licence. HKTV successfully challenged the government's decision by judicial review; in April 2015, the court ordered the Executive Council to reconsider HKTV's application for licence.[4]
