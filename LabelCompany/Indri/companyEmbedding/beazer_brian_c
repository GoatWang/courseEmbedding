Mr. Zelnak brings over 30 years’ experience as a senior executive in the building materials industry, as well as an educational background that includes business administration, organizational behavior and finance.  In addition, his prior experience as the chief executive officer of a publicly-traded company is especially beneficial in his role as a member of the Audit Committee and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. His vast knowledge of the building industry and mentorship skills are tremendous assets to the Board and the executive management team in his role as Non-Executive Chairman.Brian C. BeazerChairman EmeritusMr. Beazer is our Chairman Emeritus and has served as a director of the Company since our IPO in 1994.  Mr. Beazer served as our Non-Executive Chairman of the Board from 1994 until February 2015.  From 1968 to 1983, Mr. Beazer was Chief Executive Officer of Beazer PLC, a United Kingdom company, and then was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of that company from 1983 to the date of its acquisition by Hanson PLC in 1991. During that time, Beazer PLC expanded its activities internationally to include homebuilding, quarrying, contracting and real estate and generated annual revenue of approximately $3.4 billion. Mr. Beazer was educated at the Cathedral School, Wells, Somerset, England. He is a director of Beazer Japan, Ltd. and Seal Mint, Ltd. and is a private investor.
Mr. Beazer has been in the homebuilding and construction industry worldwide for over 50 years.  His experience and vision have been driving forces at the Company since prior to its IPO. His extraordinary experience and stature as a highly respected international businessman provide the Company with unique insight into national and international economic policies that impact the homebuilding industry, as well as an in-depth understanding of the domestic homebuilding industry. We continue to benefit from his knowledge and experience in his role as Chairman Emeritus.

Ms. Acton has over 35 years of financial management expertise as well as significant experience as a finance executive for two public companies.  We believe Ms. Acton’s finance and accounting expertise is valuable to the Company in many respects, including as Chair of our Finance Committee, as well as compliance with our obligations under various regulatory requirements for financial expertise on our Board of Directors and Audit Committee.

He has substantial experience representing companies in a broad range of industries. In light of the regulatory environment in which the Company operates and the continued emphasis on corporate governance, ethics and compliance for public companies, Mr. Alpert’s experience, training and judgment are deemed to be of significant benefit to the Company.

Mr. Leemputte joined Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., a leader in specialty coffee, coffee makers, teas and other beverages, in June 2015 and served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer from August 2015 until his retirement following the sale of the company in June 2016.

Mr. Leemputte currently serves as a director of MasterCraft Boat Company (NASDAQ: MCFT).

Mr. Leemputte’s experience, particularly his increasingly important financial responsibilities for several of the nation’s leading corporations, provides significant financial and accounting expertise that has been invaluable to the Company in many respects, including assessment of our capital structure and financial strategy.Allan P. MerrillPresident  & Chief Executive OfficerMr. Merrill joined the Company in May 2007 as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and was named President and Chief Executive Officer in June 2011.

We believe Mr. Merrill’s experience in and knowledge of the homebuilding sector, gained primarily through finance, capital markets and strategic development roles over more than 20 years, is particularly valuable to the Company as it seeks to achieve its financial and operational goals.Peter M. OrserRetired President and Chief Executive Officer, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate CompanyMr. Orser has been a director of the Company since February 2016.

Mr. Orser’s experience in the homebuilding industry provides significant operational and safety expertise to the Company.

Ms. Provencio has over 30 years’ experience in the public accounting field.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our policies with respect to information that Beazer Homes collects through the website at www.beazer.com ("Website"). By visiting the Website you are acknowledging that you have read, accept, and agree to the terms of this Policy.

Privacy Policy Support.  If you have an inquiry or concern about our Policy, please contact us using the contact information below.

Changes in this Policy.  Beazer Homes may amend this Policy at any time, but we will communicate with you, as required by law, when any changes are made. Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our Policy. This Policy replaces all previous notices or statements with respect to this subject, and cannot be modified orally by any of our representatives, employees or officers.

1. Information Beazer Homes Collects

                Beazer Homes and its Affiliates, as defined below, collect personal information for permissible business purposes to assist in meeting our customers’ needs. We do not require anyone to divulge any personally identifiable information to use the Website. Certain types of information available to you on the Website (for example, pricing information) may only be accessible after you provide us with requested personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes will not collect personal information about you through the Website unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.
                
                The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.
                
Personal Information.  We collect personal information about you for many reasons and at a variety of different times.  The type of personal information we collect depends on the community you’re looking at or live in, or the services you’ve requested.  Our computer servers automatically log your IP address, the pages you click on and how long you spend there, and the web page you came from and go to next; we also save the data you type in if you want us to send you brochures or applications.
                
                The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) first, middle, and last name; (ii) home or office phone and fax numbers; (iii) home or office address; (iv) home or office e-mail address; and (v) any other information you provide to us via our contact form.
                
                Beazer Homes also collects personal information for market research and product development so we can understand your needs as a home buyer.  We may also collect personal information about you from third- parties or other sources, such as information we receive from a credit reporting agency, information about your payment history, or the status of a loan application.
                
MCOT Program.  If you choose to participate in the Mortgage Choices On-Line Tool (MCOT), you may be asked to provide information such as your monthly income and debt levels.  Please visit our Financial Privacy Notice for the privacy terms governing the collection of financial information through MCOT, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our MCOT privacy policy differs in several important respects from this Policy.
                
Information Collected Through Technology.  Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, Beazer Homes collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides Beazer Homes with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit Beazer Homes to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. Beazer Homes uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful, including, in the following ways: (a) to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                
                Beazer Homes cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving the Website.  In addition to Beazer Homes cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Beazer Homes is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies.
                
                If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security.   However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Website and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.
                
Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13.  Beazer Homes does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
                If you are under the age of thirteen (13), we ask that you do not use the Website.  Beazer Homes does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Websites.  If we do learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Website from a minor and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account on the Website or has otherwise provided personally identifiable information, you may alert us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the Website.
            


2. How Beazer Homes Uses That Information

                Beazer Homes uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, we collect this personal information so we can provide you with the services you want, make it possible for you to build, buy and insure your home and help you settle into and enjoy your new home and your community.
                
                Beazer Homes may also contact you with information on promotional offers or incentives based on information you have provided. However, you may at any time "opt-out" by following the opt-out procedures below.
                
                We may also use your personal information as required by law, in response to governmental orders or requests, to enforce the Terms and Conditions applicable to the Website, and as we deem reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or take other appropriate measures in connection with fraudulent or illegal activities.
                
                Beazer Homes may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.
            


3. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information

                Beazer Homes uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure network encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
            


4. Information Sharing

Sharing of personal information between Affiliates.  Beazer Homes is made up of a number of companies (“Affiliates”).  Beazer Homes may share with and between its Affiliates personal information you provide to Beazer Homes or any of its Affiliates.
                
Non-Affiliates/Associates/Joint Marketing.  We also share personal information with our “Associates” - third parties that we have partnered with to share in the development or management of a community. Our Associates are third parties that are not affiliated with us and who perform services or functions on behalf of Beazer Homes or its Affiliates (such as accountants, attorneys, management companies, credit bureaus and banks).  They are required to hold the personal information we provide to them in confidence, and use the personal information only to provide the services we’ve hired them to perform for us or for you.  We may provide personal information about you to trusted companies pursuant to a written agreement with them when we jointly market our services to you.  An example of this would be if a company wanted to offer insurance services in your community.  The written agreement requires that they use your personal information only for the purposes of the joint marketing and that they not share it with others.
                
                We do not sell any customer lists that contain your personal information.
                
Other Circumstances.  We may disclose your personal information as you consent or direct. We may disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information in connection with a subpoena or other legal process, in an audit, or when we record your mortgage or deed in public records. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, or in the interest of national security, law enforcement activities, or other issues of health and safety as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
                
                We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
            


5. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices

                We give customers control over their personal information.
                
                We provide you with access to your personal information in various ways, including statements and community mailings, and want you to make sure that the personal information we have about you is accurate and current.  Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.



6. Questions or Comments

                If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us at: 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com.
            


7. Miscellaneous

Terms and Conditions.  This Policy is subject to, a part of, and incorporated into the Beazer Homes Terms and Conditions.
                
Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.  Beazer Homes has no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser should allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) are informed that you do not want to be tracked.
                
                If you end your customer relationship with us, this Policy will apply to personal information we collected while this Policy was in effect.
                This Policy does not apply to personal information relating to partnerships, trusts or corporations.

Beazer was a family business for six generations[1] before expanding in the 1980s into international housing, construction and building materials group. After becoming overburdened with debt it was rescued by Hanson plc in 1991. A new Beazer Group, comprising solely the UK housebuilding business, was demerged from Hanson in 1994, and bought by Persimmon plc in 2001.

History[edit]
Early Days[edit]
The six generations mentioned above can easily be traced with the help of the Census. George Beazer born c.1783 (refer 1841 and 1851 England census) was living in the little village of Marshfield just outside Chipping Sodbury, and the Beazers stayed there for several generations. George’s son Henry (1822) was the first to be designated a mason as was Joseph (1844) and then Jesse (1874). Jesse’s work consisted largely of repairs to the farms and properties around the village, though he did manage to finance his own house at the age of only 26, an unusual achievement for a mason in those times.[2]
Jesse had eight children but only one son – Cyril H Beazer (1908-1983). Cyril started working for his father at the age of 13, but work was scarce and Cyril later moved to Bath to work for local firms, becoming a mason himself and then a general foreman. In partnership with a local businessman who owned a small plot of land, Cyril built two houses and thus began the building business that was to bear the name C.H.Beazer. During the 1930s Cyril employed no more than a few men and, in World War II was mainly involved in war damage repair work in Bath; until 1944 when he and his men were directed to undertake similar work in London.[2]
The early post-war period continued to be dominated by war damage reconstruction in Bath, but the business gradually extended to new build and to the counties around Bath. Reflecting the increased size of the business, C H Beazer (Construction) was incorporated in 1956; Cyril’s eldest son, Ralph, joined as a director and the younger brother Brian became a director in 1960. In the event it was Brian Beazer who took over as managing director in 1968 and it was he who turned this small Bath company into an international construction group.[1]
The Acquisition Years[edit]
The local firm of Mortimer & Sons, of similar size to C.H. Beazer, was bought, its general construction business complementing what had become Beazer’s predominant private housebuilding.[1] In 1971, Beazer made a leap from what had been a predominantly south-west firm by developing a commercial property site in Brussels. Within two years it had property developments in Belgium France and Germany as well as seven schemes in the U.K.[1] Supported by those development profits, in July 1973 C.H. Beazer (Holdings) was floated on the London Stock Exchange, barely months before the onset of the first major post-war recession. Profits fell, there were property write-downs and the dividend was cut in 1976. The years that followed were ones of consolidation before the acquisitions began again at the end of the decade – only this time they were on a much larger scale.[3]
In 1979, Beazer bought the Somerset firm of R.M.Smith, doubling housing output to around 500 a year. Further acquisitions included house builders Monsell Youell and Second City Properties, the property developer M.P. Kent, brick manufacturer Westbrick and prefabricated classroom manufacturer Prattens.[4] By 1984, Beazer had become a volume housebuilder with output of over 2,000 a year. This was doubled the following year with the purchase of William Leech, taking Beazer to number four in the industry.[3]
Also in 1985 Beazer made its first foray into the USA with the purchase of Cohn Communities, a small housebuilder. A failed attempt to buy the UK’s largest scaffolding company was followed by the hotly contested purchase of French Kier, a large domestic and international contractor. This was complemented by the acquisition of contracting businesses in Hong Kong and Australia. But all this was to be overshadowed by Beazer’s next steps in the USA.[3]
In 1986, Beazer bought the Dallas-based Gifford Hill, the fourth largest cement producer in the USA, for £190m. This was quickly followed by the purchase of Koppers for $1.8 billion cash. Koppers was the second largest aggregates business in the USA but it also had a long-standing chemical and wood treatment business with what proved to be significant environmental liabilities. The Beazer group was now financially highly geared and had to face both the world wide property recession and increasing environmental liabilities – the 1989 accounts contained a provision of over $500m, and rising.[3]
The Beazer solution was to float off Beazer Europe leaving the US operations, Beazer Homes USA, as a separate business. While the pathfinder prospectus was still being circulated, Beazer received a rescue bid from Hanson plc. Hanson’s interest was in the building materials part of Beazer and it quickly sold the Kier construction business. In contrast, Beazer’s housing was held through the recession and a new Beazer Group, now consisting solely of UK housebuilding, still the fourth largest in the UK, was floated in 1994.[5] This Beazer mark 2 made its own modest acquisitions and by the end of the 1990s it was producing around 8,000 houses a year. At the end of 2000, Beazer Group and Bryant Homes proposed a “merger of equals” but this was overtaken by a bid for Bryant from Taylor Woodrow.[3] This left Beazer exposed and in 2001 it was acquired by Persimmon plc for £610m.[6]

About the Mortgage Choices Program
Beazer's Mortgage Choices program enables our homebuyers to secure theRIGHT mortgage program to meet their personal needs.



Save Time
We’ve identified, evaluated and selected 3-4 lenders in each community, so you don’t have to worry about doing the research. These lenders meet high standards of customer service.



Best Options for You
When financing your new home Beazer helps you explore finding a lender, as you would with any big purchase, that you’re most comfortable with.




Competitive Rates and Fees
When lenders compete for your business, you benefit.



Peace of Mind
Rest easy knowing you received the right product and the best deal. Not to mention, our preferred lenders provide the highest service standards and comprehensive loan portfolios for our homebuyers.




Let us help you start the process of assessing the mortgage amount for which you qualify and/or requesting financing proposals from multiple preferred lenders. It’s completely free and will take you less than 5 minutes to complete.


Assessing the mortgage amount for which you qualify

                                Getting pre-qualified is the initial step in the mortgage process. You supply a bank or lender with your overall financial picture, including your debt, income and assets. After evaluating this information, a lender can give you an idea of the mortgage amount for which you qualify.
                            



Requesting financing proposals

                                By requesting a financing proposal via Beazer’s Mortgage Choices program you’re providing information to the lenders of your choice so that they can start the process to give you estimated rates, monthly fees, etc.. This will ensure you can compare all proposals and decide which lender is right for you. In every Beazer community, we’ve identified a group of preferred lenders that you may use to shop for your home loan. This can save you hundreds of dollars a year.

What Loan Program Is Right for You?

How to Find a Mortgage Lender




FAQs
VIEW ALL FAQs 


Is there really a difference from one lender to another?
Yes – there are significant differences, including the loan programs offered, rates and fees, qualifying standards such as minimum credit scores, processing times and how the loan will be serviced after closing.  That’s why Beazer offers you access to a group of preferred lenders that have been vetted for their products, their competitive rates and fees and their superior customer service.  We encourage you to talk with several lenders so you can consider all available options and pick the lender and loan program that are best for you.
MORE 


What do I need to know about credit scores?
Your credit score is a number ranging from 450 to 850 that reflects your overall credit history.   Credit scores consider factors including your payment history to your creditors, your outstanding balances, the length of time you’ve had credit established and whether you’ve had any major credit events, such as bankruptcies, short sales or foreclosures.  Your score is important, but it’s only one of several factors that lenders consider in determining your eligibility for a loan.  If you have questions about your score or your credit history, it’s a good idea to have a lender review your credit report before you start shopping for a home. Beazer’s preferred lenders are available to help you with this.
MORE 


Does it hurt my credit score to have more than one lender run my credit report?
No - as long as you shop for your mortgage within a 14-day time frame, you can have your credit checked by an unlimited number of lenders and it will only count as a single inquiry.  This rule was put in place to give consumers the ability to apply with multiple lenders in order to find the best loan terms.
MORE 


What’s the best way for me to determine how much house I can afford?
Affordability has two components – the amount you can qualify for, and the amount you are comfortable with based on your personal budget.  A formal pre-qualification with the lender of your choice is the best way to determine how much house you can qualify for. During the pre-qualification process the mortgage lender will discuss your specific needs and outline all available options. Beazer’s preferred lenders are available to help you with a professional pre-qualification.  The amount you qualify for could be more than the amount that fits your personal budget, so be sure to consider both factors.

Your use of this web site, and any disputes arising out of such use, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to choice of law provisions, and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of Fulton County, Georgia or the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.





    *View legal disclaimer


    *The utility cost shown is based on a particular home plan within each community as designed (not as built), using RESNET-approved software, RESNET-determined inputs and certain assumed conditions. The actual as-built utility cost on any individual Beazer home will be calculated by a RESNET-certified independent energy evaluator based on an on-site inspection and may vary from the as-designed rating shown on the advertisement depending on factors such as changes made to the applicable home plan, different appliances or features, and variation in the location and/or manner in which the home is built. Beazer does not warrant or guarantee any particular level of energy use costs or savings will be achieved. Actual energy utility costs will depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to personal utility usage, rates, fees and charges of local energy providers, individual home features, household size, and local climate conditions. The estimated utility cost shown is generated from RESNET-approved software using assumptions about annual energy use solely from the standard systems, appliances and features included with the relevant home plan, as well as average local energy utility rates available at the time the estimate is calculated. Where gas utilities are not available, energy utility costs in those areas will reflect only electrical utilities. Because numerous factors and inputs may affect monthly energy bill costs, buyers should not rely solely or substantially on the estimated monthly energy bill costs shown on this advertisement in making a decision to purchase any Beazer home. Beazer has no affiliation with RESNET or any other provider mentioned above, all of whom are third parties.

Privacy Policy


Last Updated May 6th, 2015
Beazer Homes’ Privacy Commitment.  Beazer Homes respects the privacy of our customers and protection of your personal information is important to us.  Beazer Homes believes in communicating clearly with our customers.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our policies with respect to information that Beazer Homes collects through the website at www.beazer.com ("Website"). By visiting the Website you are acknowledging that you have read, accept, and agree to the terms of this Policy.

Privacy Policy Support.  If you have an inquiry or concern about our Policy, please contact us using the contact information below.

Changes in this Policy.  Beazer Homes may amend this Policy at any time, but we will communicate with you, as required by law, when any changes are made. Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our Policy. This Policy replaces all previous notices or statements with respect to this subject, and cannot be modified orally by any of our representatives, employees or officers.

1. Information Beazer Homes Collects

                Beazer Homes and its Affiliates, as defined below, collect personal information for permissible business purposes to assist in meeting our customers’ needs. We do not require anyone to divulge any personally identifiable information to use the Website. Certain types of information available to you on the Website (for example, pricing information) may only be accessible after you provide us with requested personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes will not collect personal information about you through the Website unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.
                
                The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.
                
Personal Information.  We collect personal information about you for many reasons and at a variety of different times.  The type of personal information we collect depends on the community you’re looking at or live in, or the services you’ve requested.  Our computer servers automatically log your IP address, the pages you click on and how long you spend there, and the web page you came from and go to next; we also save the data you type in if you want us to send you brochures or applications.
                
                The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) first, middle, and last name; (ii) home or office phone and fax numbers; (iii) home or office address; (iv) home or office e-mail address; and (v) any other information you provide to us via our contact form.
                
                Beazer Homes also collects personal information for market research and product development so we can understand your needs as a home buyer.  We may also collect personal information about you from third- parties or other sources, such as information we receive from a credit reporting agency, information about your payment history, or the status of a loan application.
                
MCOT Program.  If you choose to participate in the Mortgage Choices On-Line Tool (MCOT), you may be asked to provide information such as your monthly income and debt levels.  Please visit our Financial Privacy Notice for the privacy terms governing the collection of financial information through MCOT, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our MCOT privacy policy differs in several important respects from this Policy.
                
Information Collected Through Technology.  Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, Beazer Homes collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides Beazer Homes with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit Beazer Homes to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. Beazer Homes uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful, including, in the following ways: (a) to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                
                Beazer Homes cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving the Website.  In addition to Beazer Homes cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Beazer Homes is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies.
                
                If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security.   However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Website and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.
                
Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13.  Beazer Homes does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
                If you are under the age of thirteen (13), we ask that you do not use the Website.  Beazer Homes does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Websites.  If we do learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Website from a minor and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account on the Website or has otherwise provided personally identifiable information, you may alert us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the Website.
            


2. How Beazer Homes Uses That Information

                Beazer Homes uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, we collect this personal information so we can provide you with the services you want, make it possible for you to build, buy and insure your home and help you settle into and enjoy your new home and your community.
                
                Beazer Homes may also contact you with information on promotional offers or incentives based on information you have provided. However, you may at any time "opt-out" by following the opt-out procedures below.
                
                We may also use your personal information as required by law, in response to governmental orders or requests, to enforce the Terms and Conditions applicable to the Website, and as we deem reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or take other appropriate measures in connection with fraudulent or illegal activities.
                
                Beazer Homes may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.
            


3. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information

                Beazer Homes uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure network encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
            


4. Information Sharing

Sharing of personal information between Affiliates.  Beazer Homes is made up of a number of companies (“Affiliates”).  Beazer Homes may share with and between its Affiliates personal information you provide to Beazer Homes or any of its Affiliates.
                
Non-Affiliates/Associates/Joint Marketing.  We also share personal information with our “Associates” - third parties that we have partnered with to share in the development or management of a community. Our Associates are third parties that are not affiliated with us and who perform services or functions on behalf of Beazer Homes or its Affiliates (such as accountants, attorneys, management companies, credit bureaus and banks).  They are required to hold the personal information we provide to them in confidence, and use the personal information only to provide the services we’ve hired them to perform for us or for you.  We may provide personal information about you to trusted companies pursuant to a written agreement with them when we jointly market our services to you.  An example of this would be if a company wanted to offer insurance services in your community.  The written agreement requires that they use your personal information only for the purposes of the joint marketing and that they not share it with others.
                
                We do not sell any customer lists that contain your personal information.
                
Other Circumstances.  We may disclose your personal information as you consent or direct. We may disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information in connection with a subpoena or other legal process, in an audit, or when we record your mortgage or deed in public records. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, or in the interest of national security, law enforcement activities, or other issues of health and safety as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
                
                We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
            


5. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices

                We give customers control over their personal information.
                
                We provide you with access to your personal information in various ways, including statements and community mailings, and want you to make sure that the personal information we have about you is accurate and current.  Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.



6. Questions or Comments

                If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us at: 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com.
            


7. Miscellaneous

Terms and Conditions.  This Policy is subject to, a part of, and incorporated into the Beazer Homes Terms and Conditions.
                
Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.

Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser should allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) are informed that you do not want to be tracked.
                
                If you end your customer relationship with us, this Policy will apply to personal information we collected while this Policy was in effect.
                This Policy does not apply to personal information relating to partnerships, trusts or corporations.
