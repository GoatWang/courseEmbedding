Playing career
1959–1974


Allan Roy Edwards (March 12, 1937 – August 16, 1999) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played 206 games in the National Hockey League. He was born in Haldimand, Ontario. On June 6, 1967 Pittsburgh Penguins selected him in the expanstion draft, but traded Edwards to the Detroit Red Wings the next day. Roy Edwards spent six seasons with the Detroit Red Wings (1967–68) to (1973–74). During the (1971–72) he played for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
In 1958 at age 21, Edwards backstopped the Whitby Dunlops, Canada's representative, to the World Hockey Championship at Oslo, Norway, posting a perfect 7–0 record with three shutouts and an 0.86 goals-against average. The Dunlops captain was future Boston Bruins General Manager Harry Sinden.
In 1960 he became property of the Chicago Black Hawks. His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup in 1961, despite never having played a single game for Chicago. In fact Edwards did not play his first NHL game until 1967-68 season for Detroit, 7 season after being engraved on the Stanley Cup.
Edwards' road to the NHL was a long, windy one. In nine years, he played for seven teams in four leagues. Then in 1967–68, Roger Crozier stunned the Red Wings by announcing his retirement due to illness. The 30-year-old made much of his opportunity, leading the team in games and wins for four consecutive seasons.
A collision in 1970 with an opposing forward and the goalpost caused a hairline fracture in Edwards' skull, headaches and dizzy spells. His health caused him to retire, but only briefly. After a one-season comeback with the Penguins, he returned to the Wings. His 1972–73 season was his finest: winning 27 games and posting an NHL-leading six shutouts. The following season, he lost his first three decisions and retired, permanently.
Edwards was uncle to Don Edwards, another NHL goalie noted for his longevity.

Jordan Edwards Shooting: Roy Oliver, officer who fatally shot  15-year-old, is fired





































Jordan Edwards Shooting: Roy Oliver, officer who fatally shot  15-year-old, is firedPublished May 3, 2017by Stacey LeascasharetweetemailSource: Merit LawSource: Merit LawPublished May 3, 2017by Stacey LeascaRoy Oliver, the Texas police officer who shot and killed 15-year-old Jordan Edwards in Balch Springs, Texas, was fired on Tuesday, according to the New York Times.Edwards, a high school freshman and honor roll student, was leaving a party with his 16-year-old brother, Mic reported on Monday, along with three other teenaged friends when they heard gunshots.Officers initially said they were responding to a call of "drunk teens" at the time. Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber said that the teens' vehicle was "backing down the street" in a manner that was threatening to officers, according to the Washington Post. Later Haber said he "misspoke," and that the vehicle was actually driving away when Oliver opened fire.However, on Tuesday, Haber fired Oliver after an internal investigation into the shooting, the New York Times reported. Prosecutors are currently investigating the shooting and could bring charges against Oliver.Haber refused to release video footage of the event publicly while the shooting is being investigated, but did offer condolences to the family saying in part, "On behalf of the entire Balch Springs Police Department, and the city of Balch Springs we express our deep, sincere condolences to the family. We will continue to reach out to the parents and keep them informed as we move forward from this point."The family of Edwards released a statement on Tuesday following the termination of Oliver, which read in part:"We are grateful the decision has been made to terminate the officer responsible for Jordan's murder. Over the past 24 hours Chief Haber has made commendable strides toward justice. However, there remains a long road ahead. We anxiously await the officer's identification and arrest for the crime of murder. The magnitude of his horrible actions cannot be overstated. We fully expect an equivalent response from those responsible for investigating and punishing the crime."The family additionally noted that Edwards' 16-year-old brother and friends not only witnessed his horrific death, but were also "immediately treated like common criminals by other officers; manhandled, intimidated and arrested, while their brother lay dying in the front seat."

Police officer who killed Dallas-area teen fired from department

                                            In the suburbs of Dallas, 15-year-old Jordan Edwards was unarmed and shot to death by Officer Roy Oliver. The police chief of Balch Springs, Texa...
                                    

Police initially claimed the vehicle, in which Edwards was a passenger, "aggressively" backed up toward the officers, but Haber corrected the record on Monday, saying police body cam video showed the vehicle driving away when Oliver opened fire -- killing the teenager.Edwards' family released a statement shortly after the announcement, calling for charges against the officer."We are grateful the decision has been made to terminate the officer responsible for Jordan's murder," the statement read. "Over the past 24 hours Chief Haber has made commendable strides toward justice. However, there remains a long road ahead. We anxiously await this officer's identification and arrest for the crime of murder."Lee Merritt, the family's attorney, told CBS News that his clients hope the teen's death leads to "significant change in policy and procedures in the culture so that no family has to endure what they have to endure."The Dallas County district attorney's office and Dallas County sheriff's office are investigating the case.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Roy Edwards, Jr. can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
