Title: Board Member
               Company: UJA Federation of New York
Job Details
               We help make programs available to people across the economic spectrum struggling with issues from which no one is immune, like autism, mental illness, end-of-life care, and family caregiving. And we nurture the spirit, as well as the body and mind. Our support also offers a safety net for the community's most vulnerable in New York, in Israel, and around the world. Through our network of agencies, we feed the hungry, help the unemployed, empower those with disabilities, and extend a compassionate hand to the aging. In cases of natural and other disasters, such as after 9/11, we help support and organize disaster relief. We make possible countless acts of loving-kindness every day.

Larry Silverstein, a prominent leader in our community, expresses his gratitude for the help he and his staff received following the 9/11 attacks.
Title: Board Member
               Company: Ramaz School
Job Details
               At Ramaz, we are committed to instilling in our children middot, chesed, and a love of tefilla. Judaism is not something that we study; it is the way we live. By celebrating all elements of Torah life, children develop Ahavat Torah, Ahavat Mitzvot , and Derech Eretz at a very young age. The curriculum of the Early Childhood program at Ramaz is based on an interdisciplinary approach to learning. Children can learn many subjects (for example, math, science, social studies, Judaism) from a central theme. There is a strong emphasis on Torah stories, Jewish and American holidays, community, family, and nature. As the year progresses, we include emergent themes that will arise, based on the discussions and expressed interests of the individual classes.

			Kenneth W. Cappell has been one of our directors since May 2015. Mr. Cappell has been an Adjunct Professor of Accounting at Baruch College since August 2015. Mr. Cappell held a similar role at Yeshiva University from August 2014 until his appointment at Baruch College. From 1987 until 2014, Mr. Cappell was a partner of PwC and its predecessor firms, first as an audit partner (through 2000), then as a regional leader of internal audit services (through 2010), and finally as a managing partner of strategic development for PwC's Risk Assurance practice (through his retirement in 2014). Mr. Cappell has worked with public companies in a variety of industries, including consumer and industrial products, financial services and entertainment. He has advised public company audit committees on diverse topics and has served as the de facto internal audit director at several companies. Mr. Cappell is a member of AICPA and the New York State Society of CPAs. He has served as a guest lecturer at the New York University Stern School of Business and Baruch College. Mr. Cappell has a B.A. in Economics from Yeshiva University and an MBA in Finance from NYU Stern.
Mr. Cappell brings many years of experience as a partner at PwC with extensive financial accounting knowledge that is critical to our board of directors. Mr. Cappell's experience with accounting principles, financial reporting rules and regulations, evaluating financial results and generally overseeing the financial reporting process of large public companies from an independent auditor's perspective, coupled with his knowledge of internal audit, risks and controls, makes him an invaluable asset to our board of directors. We believe that Mr. Cappell's background and experience make him appropriate to serve as one of our directors in light of our business and structure.

                  Yeshiva University has been transforming lives for more than a century. Nowhere but here can students have a personal, small college experience while benefitting from the academic rigor of a top ranked research university.

Our three undergraduate schools—Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women and Syms School of Business—offer a unique dual curriculum comprising Jewish studies and liberal arts and sciences courses. Students also have the option to study in Israel in their first year.

Our graduate and affiliate schools include Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, Ferkauf Gradaute School of Psychology, Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration, Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies and Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary
