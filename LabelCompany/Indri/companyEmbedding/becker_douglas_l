Douglas L. Becker
DOUGLAS L. BECKER is President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Sylvan
Learning Systems, Inc. Since assuming the leadership role of Sylvan
Learning Systems, Inc. together with co-CEO Chris Hoehn-Saric in 1991,
Mr. Becker has transformed the company from a small tutoring company
into a dynamic, multifaceted global leader in lifelong education, often
referred to as the brand name in American education. With Becker at the
helm, Sylvan’s revenues have doubled nearly five times over the past
eight years. This steady growth, as well as the expansion of the
company’s market strength, have led to Sylvan’s being recognized as one
of the nation’s fastest growing and most promising corporations. Sylvan
was named on Fortune magazine’s list of the nation’s fastest growing
companies for 1996 and 1997, on the list of the ‘Top 10 Franchise
Opportunities’ by Franchise Times magazine, and the ‘Best of the Best’
franchises by Entrepreneur magazine, to name but a few. Success
magazine’s ‘1998 Franchise Gold 100’ named Sylvan the second best
franchise opportunity in the nation. In addition, the Baltimore Business
Journal recently recognized Becker as ‘1998 Business Person of the
Year.’ Beyond Sylvan, Mr. Becker demonstrates his commitment to
community through his service as Chairman of Port Discovery The
Baltimore Children’s Museum, a $30 million world-class educational
attraction in Baltimore’s famed Inner Harbor. In addition, he is a
trustee or director of numerous education organizations, including The
Baltimore Museum of Art, Washington College, Baltimore Reads, Inc., the
Enoch Pratt Free Library System, the University of Maryland Foundation
and Empower Baltimore.

Douglas Becker, chairman and CEO of Laureate International Universities (formerly Sylvan Learning Systems), speaks with Kelsey Hubbard about the future of for-profit higher education.



     

Transcript
This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.I ... the explosive growth in the for profit college industry going from about three hundred and sixty five thousand seats to about one point eight million in just several years I'm Kelsey Hubbard here the world this is forming revisiting is the column I'm proud to be talking to Douglas Becker he's the CEO and chairman ... of the lorry International indices formerly of Sylvan learning centers the onthe that name for the test prep at ... services that we now and thank you for being here and talking to us during this tough for ... thank you for having me ... the attributes that growth in this industry why do you think it has exploded so much in recent years ... they were now clearly in a knowledge economy and what people know really relates to how they can earn in ... and develop their careers to people are taking much more of an interest in their own education and investing more ... in their education ... what role TCE laureate can actually universities in other for profit colleges playing in the educational landscape right now in the eye in America ... I think that what's what people are trying to do is create a access ... and access for many people who might not otherwise have had the opportunity to go to university ... or maybe offering very specific when each programs ... that wouldn't otherwise have been offered in the private sector tends to be extremely ... innovative in developing programs that perhaps the public sector might now to develop on their own ... alarmingly your or your seems to characterise for many people who ... didn't have the opportunity to do a traditional brick and mortar say four-year ... private college or star kicker ... muni College or even a public college ... will allow for the Laurie universities are upside United States and there most of our students are ... traditional eighteen to twenty two year-old students ... in the U S most of our students are through our Walden University ... in their graduate students their masters and doctoral level students ... working professionals ... who are looking for programs to really meet their schedule in the needs ... and the demands of their practice in the profession ... like getting upper city the common on some of that ... criticism of the industry in for profit industry and nationwide in terms of youthful innocence of scrutiny from Congress the Department of Education ... and is in deceptive or misleading practices I know your ... company has not been cited as it is doing this but what I think this overall it's a question answered a few rotten apples are spoiling the reputation of the group or how do you address that this is the ... I think the point is it's a very diverse sector ... and education comes from accredited institutions whether their ... for profit or non-profit ... for profit really just means that the taxpayers ... and is nothing to be ashamed of in paying taxes ... and non-profit institutions have to justify their tax exemption ... which is a privilege ... to me it's really more about the educational institution ... whether to credited ... with that they have high standards ... whether they're following the rules ... are not following the rules ... of the Department Education has the means to bring them in or shut them down ... we would encourage that they should do so ... there are always to be some people that are going to make mistakes because it is a sector that serving literally millions of students ... I think most of the school's ... ten to be very devoted to good outcomes for students ... and two and two inclusion in this is a very important point ... a lot of the sector serves a very underserved population including a lot of minority students ... and a lot of the schools are playing a very integral part ... in creating an opportunity to educate ... people that otherwise may not have the option ... and this really looking at possible regulation coming down to take especially as common as Commerce is looking at things roughly ten percent of all tyrants he's attending for profit schools that they account for nearly a quarter of the federal loan ... of borrowers and forty three percent of all the de Foltz a lot of these teams are taking on these loans they can't keep them back there could be regulation coming down on the page here ... affected ... why think we actually are proponents of on of stronger regulations we think ... that it's important or raise the bar ... and to get rid of players that are not doing a good job ... I think it is important or recognize that the sector includes institutions that are serving ... vocational and technical students ... all the way up to our students who work for example mostly masters and doctoral level students so it's a very very big difference ... we tend to have very very LOS about default rates ... and that probably lowest in the industry ... so our students to repay their loans ... or some other ... institutions with the students don't repay their loans ... and in some cases that's part of the government's attempts to include more more people ... died in the opportunity in experience of getting an education ... I hear you did not graduate from college he wanted to get straight into business up to your breath that this is India would you think a college education ... in United States today is worth the money ... college education is a great investment and it is something that for most people ... it's an essential part of their journey towards achieving their ... career inhibitions that day and their families may have ... in fact outside the United States ... the differential between what one would earnings if you have a degree versus not easy to much greater than in the United States and that's why a lot of our work ... focuses on serving out the pots out of United States ... and creating the middle classes in the emerging country so ... I think it's very worthwhile but it really depends some programs are a lot less worthwhile than others ... and some institutions are less worthwhile than others to the students really need to do the research and see if they can understand how to make the numbers work ... and thought hanging in the Douglas Becker from laureate internationally in overseas Your World business Forum at Radio City music Hall I'm Kelsey Hubbard ...

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Douglas Becker Biography :


As chairman and chief executive officer, Douglas Becker led the transformation of Laureate Education (formerly Sylvan Learning Systems) from a domestic tutoring provider into the world�s leading international higher education company with operations in over 15 countries.Mr. Becker has served a Chairman and CEO of the Company since 2000, having previously served as President and Co-CEO. Under his leadership, Sylvan became the undisputed leader in K-12 tutoring with nearly 2,000 learning centers, over 200,000 students and the most recognized consumer brand name in education. The K-12 business of the company, now known as Educate, Inc., was sold in 2003 in order to allow the company to focus all of its energies on post-secondary education, by far its fastest growing line of business. It was in recognition of its new focus on higher education that the company changed its name to Laureate Education, Inc. in 2004. Laureate owns and operates private universities throughout the world to help meet the growing demand for post-secondary education.Laureate�s student enrollment has grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 37% since 2001, driving expected revenue to more than $820mm in 2005. As the first company operating large-scale universities in multiple countries, Laureate is now recognized as one of the world's most promising international companies. Today, Laureate Education offers career-oriented degree programs to over 215,000 students through its network of 20 campus-based and online institutions in Europe, Asia and the Americas a network known as Laureate International Universities.In a significant step to contribute to the revitalization of his hometown Baltimore, Mr. Becker relocated Sylvan�s corporate headquarters to the city's Inner Harbor East district in late 1996, the first move by a major corporation into Baltimore City in more than two decades. Today, Laureate�s headquarters are still located in Baltimore City, as are the headquarters of other education companies that were founded under the Sylvan umbrella such as Thomson Prometric and Educate, Inc. Today, these companies employ over 1,000 people in Baltimore and over 30,000 people throughout the world. Mr. Becker also established the Sylvan Learning Foundation (now known as the Sylvan/Laureate Foundation) in 1997 to provide support for education initiatives in Baltimore and around the world.Beyond Laureate, Mr. Becker demonstrates his commitment to community through his service as Vice Chairman of the International Youth Foundation and as Chairman of Port Discovery -- The Baltimore Children's Museum, a world-class educational attraction in Baltimore's famed Inner Harbor. In addition, he is a trustee and director of several other non-profit organizations, including FIRST Robotics, and the Economic Alliance of Greater Baltimore.
