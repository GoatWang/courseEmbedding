OUR PHILOSOPHY



Investment goals and principles
At Bennicas and Associates, Inc. our main investment goal is conservative growth coupled with preservation of capital. We seek to maximize total return while minimizing risk by designing portfolios composed primarily of diversified stocks and highly-rated bonds. 
This correlates with our basic principle of bottom-line value. We typically purchase only securities which we feel to be both a good current value and a good long-term value. Unlike many firms, we are not picking sub-advisors for clients; rather we invest primarily in individual stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles, both domestic and international.
Investment style
Our investment style relies on data as well as on the more subjective qualities of judgment and vision. Georgia’s main method of analysis is fundamental, with a focus on both quantitative and qualitative factors. She takes a broad perspective and utilizes both a macro- and a microeconomic approach when making asset management decisions in individual client accounts. 
Georgia uses her projections on economic and sector trends to design each portfolio to take advantage of a diversified mix that may include cash equivalents, domestic and international equities and bonds, gold and precious metals, and real estate. Within each sector she is looking at industry trends and projections as well as at individual company financials, and her focus is on positioning her clients for the long-term achievement of their goals.

OUR SERVICES



Building strong relationshipsWe value communication and a personal, long-term relationship with each client. Georgia wants to get to know her clients, their goals, priorities and dreams. It is also important to Georgia that clients understand and feel comfortable with her investment philosophy and style. Every new relationship begins by sitting down together and getting to know each other.   Comprehensive asset management servicesOnce a relationship has been established and initial portfolio goals and parameters have been discussed, our comprehensive asset management services can help our clients achieve peace of mind and freedom from the everyday details of investing and record keeping. Portfolios are managed on a discretionary basis, and we provide comprehensive day-to-day account administration, including security selection, trade placement, and portfolio evaluation and reporting.  We keep in touch with our clients through detailed quarterly reports, and we encourage continued communication through telephone consultations and personal meetings. Our familiarity with each client’s full financial picture allows us to serve as a valuable resource, helping clients navigate any personal financial questions that may arise. We are also happy to interface and coordinate with other members of a client’s financial team, including accountants, attorneys and bankers. In all areas our exceptional attention to detail and accuracy becomes a valuable asset for our clients.
