How do I know if my existing advisor or broker has my best interests at heart?

It’s all about transparency.
At Buckingham, we hold ourselves to the fiduciary standard, the highest in the industry. This means we enthusiastically accept the legal responsibility and obligation to serve our clients’ best interests. Sadly, some financial advisors and financial planners do not hold themselves to this same standard as we do. How do you know if your existing advisor or broker has your best interests at heart?
Here are a few questions to consider: Does your advisor earn commissions on funds or stocks he or she recommends? Does your advisor invest his or her personal assets in the same way they recommend to their clients? Are all costs clearly disclosed up front and provided in writing? Talk to Buckingham today.

What do I do if the market goes down?





Previous Question
Next Question
Close Question




 
Stick to your plan.
It’s a matter of indisputable fact. Markets go up and, yes, markets go down. The key to long-term peace of mind – and the secret to weathering the storm – is having a solid plan that’s designed to help you reach your goal despite the turbulence of the markets.
A good plan includes having the right balance of stocks and bonds – proportions determined based on your unique circumstances and goals. It also means keeping that balance no matter what happens in the market day to day or week to week. Of course, it’s not just about investments. It’s about insurance, wills, trusts and taxes and how each affects the other, today – and tomorrow. Talk to Buckingham today.

These are just a few of the important areas we incorporate into the customized plans we build for our clients. When we understand and align these critical components of financial health, our clients are able to enjoy a greater sense of confidence in their ability to achieve their highest aspirations.

How do we know we’re doing what’s best for our employees?





Previous Question
Next Question
Close Question




 
We’ll show you the way.
There are very specific rules governing your 401(k) plan, one of which is the obligation to make all decisions based on what is in the best interests of your employees. Though all plan sponsors have that obligation, unfortunately not all service providers working with retirement plans accept that same legal requirement.
As a fiduciary advisor, Buckingham serves as your true partner, helping you to satisfy this most important obligation.
Is your current advisor a fiduciary? Does your plan offer the right investment mix? Are the investments offered in your plan consistent with the guidelines in the Prudent Investor Rule? Are your employees getting the investment advice they need to make smarter decisions? Are they saving enough?
These are important questions to ask. If you’re not sure of the answers, give Buckingham a call. Talk to Buckingham today.

Building value from top to bottom.
When your 401(k) plan is healthy and growing, your participating employees see value in it. When they get solid, objective advice from advisors they can trust, and when they can start to see a brighter future, those positive feelings transfer to you as an employer. Employees who feel better and more secure about their futures often stay longer, and are often more productive on the job.
At Buckingham, we don’t ‘sell products.’ We provide a comprehensive service designed to simplify the process and enhance the retirement outcomes for participants, giving your executive team and your employees the ability to build a brighter future. Talk to Buckingham today.

Boost participation.
It may seem obvious – but one of the best ways to increase the value of your plan is to boost participation and savings rates and to position it for long-term, sustainable growth.
At Buckingham, we believe increasing savings rates and participation hinges on education – so that’s where we start. And because we are independent financial advisors, we’re able to offer direct financial advice. Based on established profiles, we help guide your participants toward investment mixes that meet their needs, rather than bombarding them with a list of available fund options and hoping they make good choices. Talk to Buckingham today.

At Buckingham, we make investment decisions based on what decades of peer-reviewed evidence demonstrates to be the best way to capture market returns. We look beyond the hype to make recommendations and craft investment profiles based on this research, not conventional Wall Street speculation. Talk to Buckingham today.

Next Question
Close Question




 
It starts with questions.
Chances are, you have a lot of questions about the financial welfare of your business. But is your current advisor asking you questions, too? As a fiduciary we’re legally required to do what’s in your best interest. That means going beyond the obvious to do what’s right for you, your family and your practice.
At Buckingham, our advisors take the time to get to know you so we can have the maximum positive impact on your finances. Maybe you’re looking to sell your practice. Maybe you need ongoing accounting and tax advice. Or maybe you’re looking for a long-term retirement and transition plan. Whatever your goals, we take an integrated approach, because each of these aspects of your finances affects the other. See how we bring it all together.

Talk to an Advisor











Sleep well knowing every facet of  your financial life is covered.
We’re here to help you rest easy with the knowledge that you have an advisor who’s committed to doing what’s best for you. That means getting to know you in a real way – how you think, how you work, and how you want your assets to help you live your life in the most enriching way.

It means creating a plan to free you from worrying about the ups and downs of the market, so you can focus on what really matters.




Discovery
Analysis
Implementation
Ongoing Management



Different – right from the start.

From day one, you’ll see that working with Buckingham is different. With typical ‘financial planners,’ the discovery process often begins and ends with numbers. But at Buckingham, our first priority is to listen to you and your family. We take the time to understand your unique situation — your opportunities, your challenges and your hopes and dreams for the future.
The value we bring to our clients goes well beyond choosing and managing the right investments. We look into every aspect of your financial picture – from insurance, to trusts, taxes, business valuations and more. We study all forms of risk in your portfolio – and then help you discover more ways to make the most of your money and your life.

Where the rubber meets the road.
With your plan in place, your Buckingham team then puts it into action, working with your accountant, estate planner, attorney and other advisors to ensure your money is where it should be based on your current and future needs.
Our Investment Policy Committee, a full-time team made up of advisors, researchers and financial specialists, continuously studies, evaluates, and applies the latest peer-reviewed financial research to ensure the recommendations we make live up to our exacting standards.
Our dedicated fixed income team helps you find the best ways to balance risk while providing protection against inflation. Each client’s need for fixed income assets is unique. Your Buckingham advisor will help you find and preserve the right balance for you.
Taxes, of course, are a big part of the equation, and, having been founded by four CPAs, central to our approach to wealth management. We look at taxes as a year-round strategy, monitoring your plan, your investments and the performance of the market for tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

We’re here to help you make smarter decisions and to provide the discipline you need to stay the course. In addition to conversations that happen in person, on the phone or over email, we constantly publish new content to our web site and social media feeds to inform and educate our clients and those most important to them.
As your trusted advisor, we are always here for you, so you never have to worry.

Smart decisions take into consideration your total financial circumstance.
During our discovery and analysis phases, we look at your investment mix and see what’s working and what’s not. By collaborating across the firm with our equity, fixed income and tax strategies teams, we help you understand exactly why different vehicles might be right for you moving forward, so you can rest easy and continue to make smart decisions.
To us, smart decisions take into consideration your total financial circumstance. So as we make recommendations about trades or sales, we measure their potential impact against both total assets and future tax implications, always looking at the big picture.

What is risk?





Previous Question
Next Question
Close Question




 
Risk is inherent and essential.
When it comes to the financial markets, risk is commonly thought of in terms of the volatility or uncertainty that exists with any given investment. Ultimately, risk is an inherent and essential part of the markets as risk and expected returns are tightly related: the higher the perceived risk, the higher the expected returns.
At Buckingham, we work with our clients to understand and take into consideration a full spectrum of risks that may be present in their unique circumstances relative to investments, insurance, job security and diversification, tax liabilities and beyond. After we identify which risks exist, we craft the right strategies and plans to minimize any negative impact they may have, while appropriately capturing any opportunities they offer.

We’re ready to respond.
Like everything else about our tailored client experience, how often you hear from us is based on your specific preferences and best ways of working together. At a minimum, you receive quarterly reports, with clear, transparent accounting of your returns and any transactions we may have executed during that period.  We also have real-time progress meetings to make sure we remain in close touch with your needs and circumstances.   Anytime you have questions throughout the year, we’re ready to respond with clear, thorough answers.
We are also proud to provide a wide range of educational resources to you whenever you want it, on our website, via social media and digital newsletters. We have a deep bench of advisors and investment analysts that are nationally recognized thought leaders. We are at the forefront of evidence-based investing and wealth management – and we’re committed to sharing information with you.

Doing the right thing is the only thing to do.






Our Approach
Our simple promise can change your life.

We are Buckingham Strategic Wealth, a growing organization of advisors, financial specialists and national thought leaders committed to delivering on the promise of true wealth management.
The essence of our approach is based on a pledge to act in your best interests.
This means making recommendations based on what decades of peer-reviewed financial research has shown to be the right way to invest. It means getting to know you, your family, your goals and your most important dreams. It means crafting a plan that touches on – and improves – the most important aspects of your life.
The cornerstone of our approach is our investment philosophy, which is built on a deep understanding of how to best capture the returns of the financial markets. Our approach is based on established facts and real evidence, not empty opinions or the media’s “flavor of the month” speculation.
Investment planning is, of course, just one part of the Buckingham experience. How do your taxes impact your savings? Do you have the right insurance? Do you have an estate plan? Are you taking on the right amount of risk?
As your trusted advisor, these are the questions we help you answer. Our goal is to free you from worrying about the daily ups and downs of the market, so you can focus on the things that really matter.
See us in action.






We do what’s right for you.
Lots of people say they’re acting in your best interests – but how can you be sure?  As  fiduciary advisors, we’ve chosen to hold ourselves to the highest legal standard to act, serve, and advise based on what’s in your best interests.  And the recommendations and decisions we make every day reflect that. Our team of advisors and specialists are here to help you make the most of your money, so you can reach your goals.



Acting in your best interest.



We turn the power of the markets in your favor.
We believe in using the science of investing to drive better decisions about your money and your future. That means having a well thought out plan and having the confidence to know that it’s been built to withstand the day-to-day, week-to-week turbulence of the financial markets.  With evidence-based investing, you can focus on the destination and more easily enjoy the ride.



Evidence-based investing.



We want you to know what we know.
Sometimes, it feels like there’s a lot of “secrets” in this business. Not here. Our nationally recognized team of advisors, specialists, and thought leaders publish articles practically every day about topics important to investors.  Why do we share? Because that’s the best way for you to make good, long-term choices. And we believe that if you understand precisely what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, you’re going to sleep a lot better at night.



A passion for education.



It pays to take a step back.
Being a true, independent wealth advisor is a lot more than just handing your investments. We take a look at your total financial picture – your aspirations, your relationships, your assets, your insurance policies, your trusts, businesses, and interests. From there we create a holistic plan that helps you and the most important people in your life meet your long-term goals.



Big-picture planning.






Celebrating 20 Years.
Our founders came together in 1994 with a surprisingly novel idea: that clients’ interests should come first. That the Wall Street speculation machine was causing more harm than good. That by putting the power of evidence-based investing and thoughtful, multi-faceted planning to work for our clients, we could help them safeguard their financial futures and achieve their most important goals. Twenty years and thousands of clients later, we are proud to know how our values and approach have improved and enriched the lives of so many individuals, families and organizations.

Bringing simplicity, transparency, and lower costs to your retirement plan.
We share your mission to help your retirement plan participants achieve their financial goals. It’s why we make a fiduciary promise to every client: we will act in your best interests, no matter what.

We believe that starts by implementing a fiduciary-based service model that focuses on helping plan sponsors and participants make smart, informed decisions to enhance participant outcomes with the upmost transparency.




Participant Education
Fiduciary Liability Transfer
Independence and Transparency



We provide support.
Typically when employees enroll in a 401(k) plan, they’re overwhelmed by long, unstructured lists of fund choices and investment alternatives. Engaging Buckingham means working with a retirement plan partner focused on providing participants with clear, appropriately diversified, professionally managed portfolios, and most importantly, personalized, one-on-one advice from a fiduciary advisor.
This approach helps demystify the complications of retirement planning, making it easier for your employees to make smarter decisions about their futures.
We focus our efforts in areas that can make the most impact to increase participation levels as well as savings rates. This benefits both your plan overall and enhances the experience for your employees.
We provide all of the support you need to educate your employees on the value of your 401(k) plan as part of our core service to you. This includes group and individual meetings, investment guidance and more.

Responsibility is on us.
As a plan sponsor, you are fiduciary to your plan participants. This means that legally you are held to the standard of an investment professional and that you are liable to ensure that you follow a prudent process when selecting and monitoring the investment options in your plan. However, ERISA allows you to put your hands up and claim that you are not a professional and delegate that responsibility to an independent firm. Most plan sponsors are unaware of this option and unfortunately most service providers are not willing to serve in this fiduciary capacity.
When you hire Buckingham, we transfer that liability away from you and welcome with open arms the role of serving as a fiduciary and doing everything in your participants’ best interests.

This means the funds we select for you are the ones that will help your participants reach their goals.

The truth is, maybe you don’t have to.
But we believe you should always look at anyone you work with and make sure they have your plan’s best interests at heart. Unfortunately, in today’s world, good intentions may not be good enough. We suggest you have your advisor confirm in writing that they are acting as a fiduciary so they are legally required to do what’s best for your participants.
Are all of your service providers’ fees transparent, or are they buried in the investment choices (leading to conflicts of interest)? Are they fully explaining all investment options to your plan participants? And are your employees finding value in their service and advice? At Buckingham, the answer to all of these question is yes.

The cost structure of our plan is 100% transparent.
You’ll always know what you are paying and what you and your plan participants are getting for it. Rather than having all the costs buried in fund expenses or annuity contracts (only to be then shared by multiple service providers), our pricing structure allows for ultimate control and transparency.
This brings an unusual level of scalability to your plan administration, so the fee as a percentage may decrease as your plan grows. This can often lead to significant savings over time.

Rather than having all the costs buried in fund expenses or annuity contracts (only to be then shared by multiple service providers), our pricing structure allows for ultimate control and transparency.
This brings an unusual level of scalability to your plan administration, so the fee as a percentage may decrease as your plan grows. This can often lead to significant savings over time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
