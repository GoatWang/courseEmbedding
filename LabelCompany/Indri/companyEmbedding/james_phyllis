FDA Seizes Misbranded Supplement Products
Stephen Barrett, M.D.
On February 13, 2003, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), U.S. Marshals seized products from Global
Source Management & Consulting, Inc., in Sunrise, Florida.
The seizure, which encompassed 450 bottles and 57,000 bulk capsules
worth nearly $19,000, was made because the FDA determined that
these products were being marketed with illegal claims that included
preventing cancers and treating arthritis. After investigating
the firm's marketing practices, the agency warned that many of
its products made drug claims that subject them to be regulated
as drugs. During subsequent inspections, despite the warnings,
FDA inspectors obtained copies of product labels and promotional
catalogs that contained the illegal claims [1].
The seizure included about 20 products that were marketed under
the names Vitamin Hut and RX for Health through retail booths
and by mail order. The food and drug laws do not permit dietary
supplements to make claims that the products will cure, mitigate,
treat, or prevent disease. Moreover, the labeling must be truthful
and not misleading. Because these seized products made disease
claims on the labels and in promotional catalogs, FDA considers
them to be unapproved new drugs. Before an unapproved new drug
product may be marketed, it must be shown to be safe and effective
and approved by FDA. Drug product labeling must also include adequate
directions for use, which the seized products' labeling did not
provide [1].
The company was founded in 1991 by Gary R. Dubin, who has BS
degrees in chemistry and zoology and an MBA. It operates many
Vitamin Hut retail outlets in high-volume malls, airports, and
train stations. Its Web site states:

Global offers information on thousands of herbs, vitamins,
  minerals, biologicals and a variety of alternative care products
  as well as over a hundred disorders. This information is provided
  on the Internet from the leading experts in the field through
  excerpts taken from health books [2].
"Leading experts"? Are they kidding? Clicking the
site's link for "Disorders
Information" brings the reader to a "Supplements
Relating to Disorders" table that contains links to information
on "disorder descriptions, characteristics or symptoms; causes,
and complementary or alternative treatments" for AIDS, cancer,
multiple sclerosis, inflammation, kidney problems, tumor, ulcers,
and more than 100 other diseases and conditions.

Clicking any link brings up a
page containing a description of the condition plus information
about causes and treatments taken from the second edition of Prescription
for Natural Healing, by James F. Balch, Jr., MD, and Phyllis
A. Balch, CNC [4] James F. Balch, Jr., is a urologist who practiced
in Indiana but is no longer listed as licensed in the state medical
board's directory, so I assume that he now devotes his time to
writing. In a predecessor book published in 1987, he described
how Phyllis had counseled hundreds of his patients and used hair analysis
and cytotoxic
testing as a guide [5]. (Both are quack tests [6,7].) During
the mid-1990s, James was also associated with A.
Glenn Braswell, a mail-order retailer who flooded the country
with brochures (some accompanied by letters under Balch's name)
for dubious herbal and supplement products [8].
The book's back cover describes Phyllis Balch as "a certified
nutritional consultant who received her certification from the
American
Association of Nutritional Consultants and has been a leading
nutritional consultant for almost two decades." She also
founded "Good Things Naturally,"a health-food store
in Greenfield, Indiana. AANC is a thoroughly disreputable organization
whose only membership requirement has been payment of a $50 fee
and whose "CNC" designation is based on passage of an
open-book examination based mainly on the contents of quacky books
[9]
About 450 of the book's 608 pages provide an A-to-Z compendium
of health problems and the authors' lists of nutrients that are
"essential," "very important," "important,
"or "helpful." Some lists contain more than thirty
items. The authors recommend daily dosages of 3,000 mg or more
of vitamin C for everybody ("for maintaining good health")
and higher doses (up to 20,000 mg/day "under a doctor's supervision")
for dozens of problems. They also recommend daily dosages of emulsified
vitamin A ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 IU for many conditions
and 75,000 IU for "maintaining healthy eyes." [4:258]
The vitamin C dosages are high enough to produce severe diarrhea;
and the vitamin A dosages are high enough to cause liver injury.
From a scientific viewpoint, the book's advice is loony from beginning
to end, but the dietary supplement industry loves it because it
enables retailers to refer their customers to an "authoritative"
source of advice for nearly every problem the customer may have
[10].
In 1993, posing as potential customers, FDA agents visited
health food stores in 20 communities and asked (a) "What
do you sell to help high blood pressure?" (b) "Do you
have anything to help fight infection or help my immune system?"
and (c) "Do you have anything that works on cancer?"
In response to about 20% of the queries, the retailer looked up
the answer in Prescription for Nutritional Healing or advised
the agent to refer to or purchase it [11].
The 1994 Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act (DSHEA) permits sellers to provide third-party
literature that contains "nutritional support" claims
that are "truthful and not misleading." To be legal
under DSHEA, a "nutritional support" statement must
not be a "drug" claim. In other words, it should not
suggest that the product or ingredient is intended for preventing
or treating disease.
I do not believe that Global's use of the book is legal. The
information it provides is taken from the book's nutrient tables
and herbal advice, which give products and doses for preventing
and/or treating diseases. Global's
cancer page, for example, recommends: coenzyme Q10 ("improves
cellular oxygenation"); garlic ("enhances immune function");
melatonin ("a powerful antioxidant that also aids sleep");
natural beta-carotene ("needed by all cells for repair and
rebuilding"); selenium ("powerful free radical scavenger.
aids in protein digestion"); shark cartilage ("for cancer
treatment"); vitamin A (up to 100,000 IU/day); vitamin B
complex; vitamin C ("powerful anticancer agent" -- 5,000
to 20,000 milligrams/day); vitamin E; grape seed extract; kelp
or seaweed; multi-mineral complex with calcium, magnesium and
potassium; multivitamin complex; dandelion; echinacea; green tea;
red clover; suma; and cat's claw ("enhances immune function
and has anti-tumor properties"). Green tea may have some
value as a preventive, but the rest of this list has not been
proven useful for prevention or treatment -- and beta-carotene
supplements may even increase cancer risk [12,13].
It seems to me that the claims on Global's Web site are far
more blatant than those for which the FDA took regulatory action.
Since the site is a form of advertising, I believe that the Federal
Trade Commission also has jurisdiction and should act.

Product Description▼▲
We all want a faith that won't let us down in times of trouble or loss, uncertainty or fear. A faith that can pull us through the worst - and best - times in our lives. This is the kind of faith that James writes about. It is the faith that we practice day by day. Studying James will help us grow a steadfast faith that can carry us through life. This revised LifeGuide study features additional questions for starting group discussions and for meeting God in personal reflection, together with expanded leader's notes and a new "Now or Later" section in each study. Includes nine studies for individuals or groups.

            We use this in our small group ladies' Bible study and have found this to be a deep and challenging study and we all have found good life application.  We all appreciate studying a book going verse by verse.  I would highly recommend this for a small group study.

            We are in the middle of this study in our Bible Study at church and have seen a growth in our understanding of faith that works. For some it is a reminder, for others it seems to be a match that is lighting their fire. Praying the "flame" ignites in all of us. Good solid study on what it takes to grow our faith into movement and service to God and His children.

            This is my favorite study out of the ones my Bible study group has done. James is so blunt, but gives us such practical advice God wants us to follow. It has also been the best study for rich and meaningful discussion.

            Our small study group just finished the first lesson. This is going to be a great tool to help these gals grow spiritually! Easy to understand and helps Scripture to come "alive"!

            Good resource book for teenagers feeling troubled or lost.  This book shows them to keep their faith in God and steadfast in his word and he will carry them through whatever it is they are going through.
