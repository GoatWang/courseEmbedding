The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors including those described under the heading Risk Factors in the Company’s final press release, dated May 14, 2010 filed with Securities and Exchange Commission, and in documents subsequently filed by the Company from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this conference call, and are subject to change, at any time. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by the applicable law or regulations.
And now, I want to talk about our financial performance for the six-months ended March 31, 2017. First with our net revenue, the Company’s revenue increased by 1.2% to $0.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $0.49 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016. Company had no revenue from software solutions for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.06 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016.
Revenues from wireless system solutions increased by 15.7% to $0.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, wireless system solution sales increased to 100% from 99.5% of our total revenue. The increase in revenue from wireless system solutions was mainly attributable to the revenue recognition from the contract signed in earlier period.
To the next with our cost of sales, cost of sales decreased by 1.7% to approximately $281,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 from approximately $286,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. As a percentage of our total revenues, cost of sales decreased to 56% of our total revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2017 from 57.7% of our total revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2016, which primarily attributable to the fact that the projects the Company had worked on were with old clients. So therefore, they made our work more efficient.
Cost of sales for wireless system solutions increased by 13.3% from approximately $248,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2016 to approximately $281,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017. This means 100% and 86.7% of the total cost of sales and 56% and 57.1% of wireless system solution revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.
For the six months ended March 31, 2017, the gross profit increased by 5.2% to $0.22 million from $0.21 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016. Gross margin for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was 44% compared to 42.3% in the six months ended March 31, 2016. Gross profit from wireless system solutions increased by 18.8% for the six month ended March 31, 2017 to $0.22 million from $0.19 million and gross margin increased to 44% from 42.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2016.

The total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was $0.8 million compared to $1.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016. This is representing a decrease of 44.3%. Selling expenses decreased by 20.6% to $0.05 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.07 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016, and represented 10.8% and 13.7% of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.
The decrease in sales expenses was a direct result of Company’s cost control decisions to reduce the marketing and travelling expenses, coping with the depression in the software solutions markets. The demand for software solutions product is lower because most of our clients are government. The government companies with the macro-policy in China that controls that’s spending package in government again [Indiscernible] and fewer clients in [such nature] [ph] were inclined to buy value added software solutions.
Our general and administrative expenses were approximately $0.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of 43.3% from $1.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016, which represented 147% and 262.3% of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of compensation and benefit expenses relating to personnel other than our engineers and our sales and marketing team members, depreciation and amortization expenses and overhead expenses.
General and administrative expenses also include legal and other professional fees, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the decreased bad debt expenses, caused by the write-off of certain aged receivables and decreased labor costs as a result of the decreased business operations in the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the last year.
Research and development expenses were zero for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $54,000 for the same period last year. Our income from operations, the Company had loss from operations of $0.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017 comparing to the loss from operations of $1.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.6 million, which primarily due to the lower general and administrative expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year.
Our net income, our net loss and our earnings per share; net income was approximately $50,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net loss of $0.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016. Basic and diluted income per share was $0.03 in the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.48 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. Our cash, as of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.6 million comparing to $1.2 million as of September 30, 2016 -- the Company’s last fiscal year -- net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $0.05 million comparing to approximately $0.5 million used in operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2016.
For the six months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had a net income of $50,000 comparing to the net loss of $0.7 million for the same period last year. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $4.4 million compared to approximately $0.7 million used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, the closing balance of deals from the related parties decreased by $4.6 million to $1.6 million comparing to $6.2 million as of September 30, 2016. Net cash provided by investing activities was zero for the six months ended March 31, 2017 comparing to [1000] [ph] provided by investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2016.

Now our financial outlook is based on the results of the first six months of fiscal year 2017 in light of increased competition pressure and continue negotiations for the new contracts was expected to be signed later in the year. So the Company updated its previously released guide for the fiscal year 2017. We now expect revenue in the range between $2 million and $4 million, and net income in the range between $0.0 million and $0.5 million.

					Full Description



Kingtone Wirelessinfo Solution Holding Ltd, incorporated on October 27, 2009, is a holding company. The Company is a developer and provider of mobile enterprise solutions. The Company's mobile enterprise solutions allow company personnel whose work function requires mobility to be connected with enterprise information technology (IT) systems, including Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The Company's software enables these systems to get extended to personnel in the field using wireless devices, such as smart phones, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), cameras, barcode scanners, portable printers, global positioning system (GPS) devices and tablet computers. Its mobile enterprise solutions also contain custom software applications for specific industries and businesses. The Company's subsidiaries include Topsky Info-tech Holdings Pte Ltd. and Xi'an Softech Co., Ltd.The Company's mobile enterprise solutions are built on its core middleware platform. This core middleware platform allows its solutions to integrate with its customers' existing information management systems. The core middleware platform can host a range of applications developed by the Company or by others. Its mobile computing allows field workers to communicate and interact with their central operations, and vice versa. The Company provides the mobile enterprise software solution and wireless system solution, including mobile enterprise software and all hardware (its own plus third-party hardware, such as servers or wireless devices). Its mobile enterprise software for insurance industry application enables an insurance company's field personnel to receive their dispatch information, and proceed accident reporting and claim processing while in the field. The Company conducts its operations through Xi'an Kingtone Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Kingtone Information) that develops and provides mobile enterprise solutions in the People's Republic of China.Core Middleware PlatformThe Company's core middleware platform resides on the customers' servers. The Company's platform consists of two layers of modules: General Purpose Layer and Basic Layer. The General Purpose Layer consists of software modules required to support the application software plugged into the middleware platform. The Basic Layer modules are components that perform basic functions, such as communicating with a range of hardware and software platforms, computer operating systems, networking and database products, coordinating and synchronizing the tasks performed by its solutions, and adding information security to data transmission.Software ApplicationsThe Company has two types of software applications that can be overlaid with middleware for a packaged solution, such as Information and Communication-Technology Converged (ICT-converged) and Vertical Industry Applications. The Company's ICT-converged applications perform generic functionalities that may be applied across various industries. Its Vertical Industry Applications are non-generic and perform a specific task required by a particular industry. Both types of applications can reside on converged mobile devices (Terminal-end Applications) or on computer servers (Server-end Applications). Its Terminal-end Applications work on a range of mobile devices and mobile operating systems.In the Terminal-end, the Company has information security, Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), location-based service, steam media, information exchange, and management and configuration applications. The information security application encrypts or decrypts the information to ensure sensitive or classified information of its vertical industry customers can be transmitted over the public wireless telecommunication network securely. Installed with its RFID application and chips, a mobile phone can be turned into a RFID reader and writer for information input in certain vertical industry customers, such as the police and administration of industry and commerce. The Company's location-based service application enables a mobile phone to receive information relevant to its location. Its steam media application turns a mobile phone into a moveable video monitor and collector to facilitate decision-making by delivering live pictures to the decision-maker. The information exchange application automatically synchronizes information in the mobile phone and in the back-end database.Hardware ProductsThe Company's portable video server for vehicles or individuals can be integrated into the overall solution or purchased separately to add live mobile video surveillance or transmission functions to its customers' existing systems. The Company designs the server, including the breadboard, the layout of internal structures, the specifications of the electronic components and the input/output (I/O) specifications. It outsources the production of its hardware to third-party manufacturers. It programs the embedded software and writes the software into the portable video servers. It also programs the software loaded on its customers' central servers to work with its portable video servers.The Company competes with Syclo, Accenture, Sybase, CDC Software, Beijing Silu Innovation Technology Co. Ltd., Cyber Technologies (Suzhou) Co. Ltd., Beijing CEICT Technology Co., Ltd., Xi'an Future Technology Information Co., Ltd. and Shenzhen Shi Ji An Ruan Technology Co., Ltd.
