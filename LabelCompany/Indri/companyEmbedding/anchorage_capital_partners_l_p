Under Anchorage ownership, a ‘back to basics’ turnaround blueprint was developed and executed in conjunction with senior management resulting in demonstrable improvements in the performance and quality of the business
Antares was successfully sold to The Blackstone Group in November 2011
Transaction backgroundBurger King NZ was acquired by Anchorage and the senior management team from private shareholders.  The senior management team included both a new CEO and Director of Operations from the outset of the investment.  Business overviewBurger King is a leading quick service restaurant (QSR) brand and is the second largest hamburger chain in the world and NZ.  It is most recognised for its signature burger, the WHOPPER.  Burger King NZ offers a range of authentic flame-grilled beef and quality chicken burgers and is known for having the best tasting and biggest burgers amongst its competitors. Antares owned and operated all but three of the Burger King restaurants in New Zealand with the remaining three restaurants franchised.  Antares also had a joint venture interest in a local meat processing operation supplying beef patties to the Burger King NZ network and export customers in South East Asia.Turnaround program

Heinz Company Australia Limited (Heinz) have today announced they have entered into an Implementation Agreement whereby it is proposed that Heinz will acquire all of the Golden Circle shares on issue for A$1.65 cash per share (the Heinz Proposal), valuing Golden Circle at approximately $288 million. The acquisition is to be implemented by way of a Scheme of Arrangement (the Scheme) under which Golden Circle Shareholders will be asked to vote on the Heinz Proposal at a Scheme Meeting, expected to be held in early to mid December 2008 (Scheme Meeting). Further details of the Scheme will be provided to Golden Circle Shareholders in the coming weeks through an Explanatory Booklet, which will include an Independent Expert's Report.
  Scheme Highlights 


Heinz proposes to acquire the entire issued capital of Golden Circle for $1.65 per share in cash 
The Directors of Golden Circle strongly encourage Shareholders to vote in favour of the Scheme - either in person at the Scheme Meeting or by proxy (in the absence of a Superior Proposal and subject to the Independent Expert concluding that the Scheme is in the best interest of Golden Circle Shareholders). For Shareholder approval to be obtained, more than 50% in number of Golden Circle Shareholders voting at the Scheme Meeting (whether in person or by proxy) (Headcount Test), and at least 75% of the total number of votes cast at the Scheme Meeting (whether in person or by proxy) must approve the Scheme 
If successful, it is expected that the Scheme will be implemented, including the payment of $1.65 per share to Golden Circle Shareholders, by late December 2008 Heinz has indicated its desire to maintain contracts between Golden Circle and its growers, who would benefit from potential increases in demand volume over time as Heinz grows the business 
An Independent Expert, Ernst & Young Transaction Advisory Services Limited, has been appointed by the Board of Golden Circle to consider the Heinz Proposal and provide an opinion on whether the Heinz Proposal is in the best interest of Golden Circle Shareholders, in the absence of a Superior Proposal 
The Board of Golden Circle has unanimously recommended the Heinz Proposal, and intends to vote in favour of the Heinz Proposal with respect to all Golden Circle shares held by them or in which they otherwise have a relevant interest. This unanimous recommendation is subject to no Superior Proposal emerging and the Independent Expert concluding that the Scheme is in the best interest of Golden Circle Shareholders 
Golden Circle's major Shareholder, Anchorage, intends to vote their shares in favour of the Scheme, in the absence of a Superior Proposal 
$1.65 per share represents a significant premium of 313% to the closing price of Golden Circle on 3 October 2008 of $0.40, being the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Heinz Proposal 
Every Golden Circle Shareholder will be asked to vote on the Heinz Proposal at a Scheme Meeting expected to be held in early to mid December 2008, either in person or by completing the relevant proxy form  Important information on the Heinz Proposal will be contained within the Explanatory Booklet which is expected to be circulated to Golden Circle Shareholders in late October or early November 2008 
Implementation of the Scheme is subject to a number of conditions (summarised in the attachment to this announcement) including the approval of the Supreme Court of Queensland 
Golden Circle Chairman, Mr. Phillip Cave said: "The Board of Golden Circle believes that the Heinz Proposal represents a compelling value proposition and is in the best interests of Golden Circle Shareholders. In the absence of a Superior Proposal, the Board of Golden Circle unanimously recommends that Golden Circle Shareholders vote in favour of the Heinz Proposal at the Scheme Meeting." "The continuation of contracts between growers and Golden Circle was an issue of high importance during our deliberations regarding the Heinz Proposal. Heinz has indicated its desire to maintain grower contracts," he said. "The Board also considers the certainty of timing and payment of the Heinz Proposal as attractive for all Golden Circle Shareholders, particularly during a period of difficult economic conditions". Golden Circle's largest Shareholder, Anchorage, which has a 35% shareholding commented, "The Heinz Proposal is very attractive and we intend to vote in favour of the Heinz Proposal in the absence of a Superior Proposal." Golden Circle Chief Executive Officer Craig Mills said: "Heinz is a leading global player in the food industry. It is considered an innovator with considerable marketing know-how" "The acquisition provides the opportunity for a complementary product range offering a wide variety of everyday consumer food and beverages under iconic brands." Heinz Managing Director, Mr. Peter Widdows said: "Like Heinz, Golden Circle holds a longstanding Australian heritage of providing high quality, affordable food and beverages to Australian families. We look forward to continuing this heritage and growing the Golden Circle business." "We are acutely aware of Golden Circle's origins and the importance of Golden Circle to the farming community. Our desire is to maintain contracts between growers and Golden Circle, which would benefit from potential increases in volume over time as the combined sales and marketing strength of a combined Golden Circle and Heinz is realised." "Golden Circle's workforce also forms an integral part of Golden Circle's success and will benefit from opportunities that will become available as part of the Heinz group," he said.

Anchorage Capital Partners Key Developments

Spotless Units Reportedly May Be Up For Grabs
Apr 27 17
Units of Spotless Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SPO) are reportedly up for grab. Spotless Group Holdings, which is advised by Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), has denied that any parts of the company are on the market, apart from a group of poorly performing contracts that it earlier indicated it would divest. Spotless Group Holdings had been in talks with a rival bidder, but those discussions were abandoned over the weekend. One possibility is that a party could be eager to buy Spotless Group Holdings without some of its smaller, less-successful components, and investment bankers are trying to find buyers for the unwanted divisions. Possible suitors could be smaller rival Delaware North, which has been approached before, or opportunistic private equity firms like Anchorage Capital Partners, Platinum Equity, LLC or Allegro.


Anchorage Capital Mulls Acquisition Of Fairfax Newspaper Assets
Feb 28 17
Anchorage Capital Partners also has an interest in buying Fairfax Media Limited's (ASX:FXJ) newspaper assets both in Australia and New Zealand should some shake loose as part of a breakup play.


Office Depot Reportedly To Receive Bids For OfficeMax
Feb 2 17
It's understood Office Depot, Inc. (NasdaqGS:ODP) will receive first round bids for OfficeMax Australia Limited on February 2, 2017, after putting it on the block through Goldman Sachs. Turnaround specialists, including Anchorage Capital Partners and Platinum Equity, LLC, are expected to go head-to-head with mid-market private equity firms who reckon they can make a buck by reversing OfficeMax's fortunes.
