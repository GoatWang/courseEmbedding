CIRCADIAN® acquires a controlling stake in ZircLight Inc. with a Series A investment led by ams AG

STONEHAM, Mass., Aug. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- CIRCADIAN®, the global leader in managing 24/7 workforce productivity, health and safety in businesses that operate around the clock, announced today that it has acquired a controlling stake in ZircLight Inc. with a $2.5 million Series A investment led by ams AG, a leading designer and manufacturer of sensor and analog solutions including sensor-integrated intelligent managers that are enabling the next generation of smart lighting systems.
ZircLight Inc., which will operate as CIRCADIAN ZircLight, holds the core intellectual property rights to devices including LED lighting systems, eyewear and display screens that alleviate the negative health and performance effects of artificial lighting in our nighttime environments by controlling nocturnal exposure to specific blue light wavelengths that stimulate melanopsin receptor visual pathways and cause neuroendocrine disruption (including melatonin and cortisol), and disease marker gene disruptions (including BMal1 and Per2). 
Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, the CEO of CIRCADIAN commented, "The ZircLight technology, using circadian-modulated spectrum-specific LEDs, provides a highly effective solution to nocturnal workplace lighting exposure, and a healthy alternative to the blue-pump LED lighting that is currently flooding the market. We seek to provide the energy-saving and technology advantages of LED lighting without the considerable downside risks of dosing large populations of people with blue wavelengths that have been associated with increased health risks."
"The 2007 decision by the World Health Organization to classify nocturnal light exposure as a "probable carcinogen," and the extensive human epidemiological and animal research studies over the past 10 years demonstrating that nocturnal light exposure increases cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart disease and depression, has brought public attention to this very real health hazard," explained Dr. Doros Platika, Chairman of CIRCADIAN ZircLight.
Sajol Ghoshal, Vice President, Strategic Development, Sensor Technology & Wireless Connectivity at ams AG, added, "ams is very excited about the coming wave of sensor–driven technological solutions to the health and wellness challenges that have been created by our modern environment. We see circadian modulated lighting as an important application for ams intelligent sensors that opens entirely new dimensions in the concept of high quality light, and will be the hallmark of the smart lighting revolution."
About CIRCADIAN®CIRCADIAN®, is the pioneer and global leader in 24/7 workforce risk management systems. Supported by over 30 years of research and field application experience, CIRCADIAN provides consulting and technology solutions for employers who operate night shifts or round-the-clock schedules.

	CIRCADIAN® Light fixtures for industrial and commercial workplaces provide LED light 24/7 with intelligent control of the bio-active blue dosage by time of day and season to boost alertness and productivity, and avoid exposure to the harmful effects of blue-rich light at night.The secrets to health, productivity and safety lie in the light spectrum. Lighting today is no longer just about task illumination, visual appearance and energy efficiency. Workplace lighting should also protect the health, and boost the productivity of the people who work under them.CIRCADIAN Lights are the result of a major medical science breakthrough. They are the first lights literally designed, tested and optimized for 24/7 use in a world-class medical research laboratory. They provide the proprietary unique spectrum that has been proven to protect and optimize human performance.Our intelligent CIRCADIAN lighting solutions are designed for cost savings associated with reduced absenteeism, work-related accidents, and health care costs. Isn’t it time you join the hundreds of smart companies who are installing our CIRCADIAN Lights?Explore our lights below, and then call us today to set up a demo.The Problem with Conventional Energy Efficient LightsMost energy efficient lights in the workplace today, including fluorescents and especially LEDs, have a substantial downside health risk in evening and night operations which is now recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the American Medical Association (AMA) and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Because of their high bio-active blue wavelength content, these widely prevalent lights boost alertness and productivity during the day, but at night they disrupt our circadian clock and health protecting hormones and cause a 35-65% increase in the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, sleep disorders and depression, as well as breast and prostate cancers.Learn more about the medical science behind our lights.
