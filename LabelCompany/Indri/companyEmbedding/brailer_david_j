Education[edit]
Brailer holds doctoral degrees in both medicine and economics. He earned his Ph.D. in managerial economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and his M.D. from West Virginia University.[5][6]
While in medical school, he was a Charles A. Dana Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine and was the first recipient of the National Library of Medicine Martin Epstein Award for his work in expert systems. Brailer was among the first medical students to serve on the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association. He completed his medical residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and became board certified in internal medicine along the clinical investigator pathway. Brailer was a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and, until recently, was active in patient care delivery with an emphasis on immune deficiency.[7]
He earned his bachelor's degree in science and political science from West Virginia University.[6]
Career[edit]
University of Pennsylvania[edit]
After completing a general medicine residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Brailer began work as an active patient-care physician in general medicine and in immune deficiency at the University of Pennsylvania.
Simultaneously, he taught health management and economics in the Wharton MBA program and lectured in The Wharton Executive Education program for 10 years. He also founded the health information technology program at The Wharton School Health Management Program.[8]
CareScience[edit]
In 1992, Brailer left academia and founded a company spun out of his Ph.D. thesis, inventing ways to measure health-care quality. This became CareScience Inc., a Philadelphia software firm that helped hospitals improve efficiency and prevent errors.[9] Under Brailer, CareScience established the nation's first health care Application Service Provider (ASP). Brailer led the company through several financings, strategic partnerships, an initial public offering in 2000, and sale to global software firm Quovadx in 2003.[10]
Health Technology Center[edit]
After CareScience, Brailer took an advisory role at Health Technology Center, a non-profit research and education organization that provides strategic information and resources to health care organizations about the future impact of technology in health care delivery. There, he advised the Center on a number of regional and national data sharing projects.[11]
Health Evolution Partners[edit]
In mid-2007, Brailer founded Health Evolution Partners, a private equity fund with a mission to “invest in things that can reduce the crushing costs of health care.”[12] The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) invested $700 million in the fund.[13] He is currently Managing Director and CEO of the firm.
Notable Health Evolution Partners investments include Halcyon Home Health, Prolacta Bioscience, Optimal IMX, Mollen Immunization Clinics, Kisimul, Freedom Innovations, CenseoHealth and CambridgeSoft.[5] On March 23, 2011, CambridgeSoft was acquired by PerkinElmer, Inc. in a $220 million deal.[14]
Brailer serves on a number of boards of directors, including CenseoHealth, Prolacta Biosciences and Walgreens.[15]
US Department of Health and Human Services[edit]
On May 6, 2004, Brailer was appointed as the first National Health Information Technology Coordinator, pursuant to an executive order by President George W. Bush on April 27, 2004, which called for widespread deployment of health information technology within 10 years.[16]
In this role, Brailer designed and directed a bipartisan effort to encourage the digitalization of health care. His work led to the formation of both the National Health Information Network and the Meaningful Use incentives program for the adoption of electronic health records.[17]
Awards and achievements[edit]
Brailer was the first recipient of the National Library of Medicine Martin Epstein Award for his work in expert systems.
He was also one of the first medical students to serve on the Board of Trustees for the American Medical Association.
Most notably, he was the country’s first health IT czar, leading the national effort to digitalize healthcare.

Education[edit]
Brailer holds doctoral degrees in both medicine and economics. He earned his Ph.D. in managerial economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and his M.D. from West Virginia University.[5][6]
While in medical school, he was a Charles A. Dana Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine and was the first recipient of the National Library of Medicine Martin Epstein Award for his work in expert systems. Brailer was among the first medical students to serve on the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association. He completed his medical residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and became board certified in internal medicine along the clinical investigator pathway. Brailer was a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and, until recently, was active in patient care delivery with an emphasis on immune deficiency.[7]
He earned his bachelor's degree in science and political science from West Virginia University.[6]
Career[edit]
University of Pennsylvania[edit]
After completing a general medicine residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Brailer began work as an active patient-care physician in general medicine and in immune deficiency at the University of Pennsylvania.
Simultaneously, he taught health management and economics in the Wharton MBA program and lectured in The Wharton Executive Education program for 10 years. He also founded the health information technology program at The Wharton School Health Management Program.[8]
CareScience[edit]
In 1992, Brailer left academia and founded a company spun out of his Ph.D. thesis, inventing ways to measure health-care quality. This became CareScience Inc., a Philadelphia software firm that helped hospitals improve efficiency and prevent errors.[9] Under Brailer, CareScience established the nation's first health care Application Service Provider (ASP). Brailer led the company through several financings, strategic partnerships, an initial public offering in 2000, and sale to global software firm Quovadx in 2003.[10]
Health Technology Center[edit]
After CareScience, Brailer took an advisory role at Health Technology Center, a non-profit research and education organization that provides strategic information and resources to health care organizations about the future impact of technology in health care delivery. There, he advised the Center on a number of regional and national data sharing projects.[11]
Health Evolution Partners[edit]
In mid-2007, Brailer founded Health Evolution Partners, a private equity fund with a mission to “invest in things that can reduce the crushing costs of health care.”[12] The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) invested $700 million in the fund.[13] He is currently Managing Director and CEO of the firm.
Notable Health Evolution Partners investments include Halcyon Home Health, Prolacta Bioscience, Optimal IMX, Mollen Immunization Clinics, Kisimul, Freedom Innovations, CenseoHealth and CambridgeSoft.[5] On March 23, 2011, CambridgeSoft was acquired by PerkinElmer, Inc. in a $220 million deal.[14]
Brailer serves on a number of boards of directors, including CenseoHealth, Prolacta Biosciences and Walgreens.[15]
US Department of Health and Human Services[edit]
On May 6, 2004, Brailer was appointed as the first National Health Information Technology Coordinator, pursuant to an executive order by President George W. Bush on April 27, 2004, which called for widespread deployment of health information technology within 10 years.[16]
In this role, Brailer designed and directed a bipartisan effort to encourage the digitalization of health care. His work led to the formation of both the National Health Information Network and the Meaningful Use incentives program for the adoption of electronic health records.[17]

Brailer was the first recipient of the National Library of Medicine Martin Epstein Award for his work in expert systems.
He was also one of the first medical students to serve on the Board of Trustees for the American Medical Association.
Most notably, he was the country’s first health IT czar, leading the national effort to digitalize healthcare.

David J. Brailer, MD, PhD, FACMI






Year Elected: 2004US Department of Heath and Human ServicesCurrently: US Department of Heath and Human Services
Biography and photograph when elected: A 1981 graduate of West Virginia University, David Brailer attended medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his MD in 1986. After residency training in internal medicine, he became a fellow in general internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar while working on his PhD at the Wharton School. He received the degree in 1992. He then founded CareScience, Inc., while continuing at Wharton and the University of Pennsylvania's medical school as a member of the adjunct faculty. In 2002, he moved to the Health Technology Center in San Francisco where he was a senior fellow for information technology and quality until he was recruited to the Bush Administration in early 2004 to serve as the nation's first Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the office of Secretary Thompson at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Dr. Brailer's notoriety in the informatics world began in medical school when he presented his work on expert systems at SCAMC in 1983 and was awarded the Martin Epstein Award in the student paper competition. He was also the first medical student to serve on the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association. Today, he is recognized as a leader in health information technology and how it can enhance the delivery of safe, effective, and efficient health care. He is one of the nation's foremost authorities on health information exchange and the use of peer-to-peer technologies in health care. During his ten years as Chairman and CEO of CareScience, the nation's leading registry of medical errors and physician and hospital performance, Dr. Brailer led the company to add more than 150 clients, to develop groundbreaking inventions with major research institutions, to establish the nation's first health care ASP, and to create the first care management business process outsourcing partnership. Dr. Brailer also designed and oversaw the development of the first peer-to-peer health information exchange technology and led its first implementation in Santa Barbara County, CA. In his new role, Dr. Brailer is in a position to have a major influence on federal policy and activities in the area of health information technology.

David J, Brailer, MD, PhD, was appointed the first National Health Information Technology Coordinator in 2004 to implement an Executive Order of President George W. Bush: to facilitate widespread use of health information technology within 10 years to improve patient safety and efficiency. Dr. Brailer, who earned his medical degree at West Virginia University and his PhD in managerial economics at The Wharton School, is an expert in health information technology and health systems management.
Prior to his appointment, Dr. Brailer was a Senior Fellow at the Health Technology Center in San Francisco, a nonprofit research and education organization that provides strategic information and resources to health care organizations about the future impact of technology in health care delivery. He also served for ten years as Chairman and CEO of CareScience, Inc., a leading provider of care management services and Internet-based solutions that help reduce medical errors and improve physician and hospital-based performance.
Dr. Brailer delivers the Public Policy Lecture today at the Presidential Plenary Session today at 11 AM at Exhibit Hall D. In an interview with the Neurology Today Meeting Dispatch, he highlights the government's strategies for supporting electronic health records (EHRs).

WHAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT DOING TO HELP PHYSICIANS IMPLEMENT EHR?
The Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (HIT), a voluntary, private-sector initiative to certify HIT products, is a few months away from completing its mission: To accelerate the adoption of robust, interoperable health information technology throughout the US healthcare system, by creating an efficient, credible, sustainable mechanism for the certification of health information technology products. Certification will ensure that a product has certain types of clinical prompts and decision support, privacy and security, and standards and interfaces to share information. Every doctor needs to ask their vendor if it is certified, and if not, when it intends to be.
There are three ways we can help physicians: We want to help develop lower cost technology, improve the benefits or value of these systems, and lower the risk of adopting these products.

HOW CAN THE EHR COSTS BE LOWERED AND THE BENEFITS IMPROVED?


Figure. Dr. David Br...


The cost of support, training, integration, etc. is a fixed cost whether it is provided to five doctors or 50. Unfortunately, vendors cannot make this less expensive. We need to find simpler technology for small physician offices. Most products are built for large practices, which can absorb these costs; new products need to come to the market that will be less difficult to implement and maintain and for smaller practices, which typically lack IT departments. I anticipate that the time that this article comes out, our proposed regulation allowing hospitals to donate EHRs to physicians should be accepted. We are also pushing to see doctors get paid more for using EHRs through pay-for-performance initiatives.
Back to Top | Article Outline
HOW CAN THE RISK OF ADOPTING THESE PRODUCTS BE LOWERED?
Certification will lower the risk of purchasing an EHR by allowing doctors to compare systems. For example, if two systems are both certified and one costs twice the amount of the other, doctors may select the lower cost option with the knowledge that it has met the standards required for certification.
We see physicians as falling into three categories: Doctors who have already adopted EHRs – and don't want the government telling them that it is time to switch to a new product, doctors who will never adopt technology – and should have the privilege of that option, and those who fall in between.
The end game is an effort to build a nationwide information network that will support all products. Much like a cell phone would be useless without Verizon or another telecommunications provider, the EHR is useless if it is not connected to laboratories and pharmacies. It should be plug and play. Then, it has huge value with a capacity to share information. Our vision is not to see a doctor use a product on a standalone basis.
Back to Top | Article Outline
ARE YOU ON TARGET FOR YOUR FIVE-YEAR TIMELINE?
Yes, the EHR agenda has struck a chord and gained huge momentum. That is not to say that we do not have big challenges. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services has to modernize its practices, for example. But the world is changing quickly and doctors are adopting these tools on a widespread basis.
Back to Top | Article Outline
WHAT FUNCTIONALITIES SHOULD PHYSICIANS SEEK IN THEIR EHR PRODUCTS?
We recognize that each specialty has its own requirements, either in terms of certain information that its physicians require or specific needs for documentation. So, we are asking each specialty society to provide additional criteria beyond what we establish for certification. They should ask vendors whether they can meet those specific needs and get together with other specialties and compare notes.

SHOULD PHYSICIANS PURCHASE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS TODAY OR WAIT A WHILE UNTIL THE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES?
They should start now – unabashedly, yes. Although it is true that the software technology for EHR will likely change over time and continue to evolve, the concept that you can buy an EHR that you will use for the rest of your life is flawed. EHR usage is a journey, not a destination. The things that matter, that truly deliver value, are not inherent in the software, but rather, in the re-engineering and organization of a practice, and the changes a physician makes in order to implement an EHR.

WHAT CAN THE AAN DO TO ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO ADOPT EHR?
The group that has done the most is the American Academy of Family Physicians. The pediatricians have also done a great job in changing day-to-day practice through EHR. The American Academy of Neurology needs to see how it can help its members make better clinical decisions, share information, and ask how the practice of neurology changes if doctors were to have access to real-time information.© 2006 American Academy of Neurology

Prion Diseases: Is the Pathology for Alzheimer's and Multiple System Atrophy Transmissible?
What’s behind the pathological process of proteins misfolding and aggregating in conditions such as Alzheimer’s and multiple system atrophy? The Neurology Today editors analyze insights from two new papers with Dr. David Holtzman, professor and chair of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
Read the full stories here and here.

Diabetic Neuropathy: A New Model for Testing Treatments
An emerging concept is that diabetic neuropathy is associated with metabolic syndrome, and not hyperglycemia alone. The Neurology Today editors discuss a high-fat diet mouse model and how it could translate into new research targets for peripheral neuropathy with Dr. Eva Feldman, director of the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute and Program for Neurology Research and Discovery at the University of Michigan.

David J. Brailer Resigns as Health IT CzarNew York, Apr 20, 2006
Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael O. Leavitt announced this evening that he has accepted the resignation of Dr. David J. Brailer as National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Brailer was appointed to the position by President George W. Bush on May 6, 2004.

 
Brailer’s office was responsible for the award and administration of four contracts supporting the creation of an interoperable, standards-based Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) in support of President George W. Bush’s goal to establish the widespread adoption of electronic healthcare records within ten years.  The American National Standards Institute received one of the contract awards to fund the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. The Panel’s mission is to assist in the development of a Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) by addressing the standards-related issues impacting the harmonization of healthcare data and networks.
 
“Over the past two years, David has made significant progress in advancing the President's health IT agenda and laying the building blocks for future progress,” Leavitt said in a HHS press release.
 
The Secretary’s statement continued with an indication that Brailer has agreed to serve as vice-chair of the American Health Information Community (The Community), which is charged with making recommendations to the Secretary of HHS to facilitate the development and adoption of standards-based health IT.
 
“David has helped the Community identify promising breakthroughs for near-term progress while continuing to move us closer to longer-term health IT goals,” said Leavitt.  “David will also continue to serve as a consultant to HHS to help lead the President's health care transparency initiative.”
 
A Financial Times online news article attributed Brailer’s departure to “family reasons” and his confidence that the program “is now mature and moving in the right direction.”
 
A replacement for Brailer has yet to be named.

Brailer: Proposed meaningful use criteria 'feel right'By Patty EnradoJanuary 11, 201008:24 AM

Share







 
The "hand of thoughtful policy" created the proposed criteria for meaningful use, according to David J. Brailer, MD, former healthcare IT czar for the Office of the National Coordinator.
"It would have been easy to be symbolic rather than meaningful," the founder and chairman of the San Francisco-based healthcare investor firm Health Evolution Partners said. He expected the criteria to "be looser, less meaningful." Instead, he said, "I'm pretty impressed."
In the short term, the recently released criteria reflect the body of work and the broad consensus of the definition of standards from the private sector, quality agencies and forums, a product certification organization and the old AHIC (American Health Information Community), he said. As health IT chief, Brailer's philosophy was having government be a supportive agent of the consensus of the work being done by the private sector. (Find the proposed criteria for providers here, and the proposed criteria for hospitals here.)
"The meaningful use criteria are highly consistent with what we did," he said. "It feels right to me."
"ONC has matured wonderfully in terms of appropriate policy going forward, using various tools as drivers for healthcare IT adoption, targeting HIEs with grants and testing ideas," he said, pointing out that under his tenure ONC built test models of the Nationwide Health Information Network.
Brailer had high praise for his successor, David Blumenthal, MD, saying he is doing a "fantastic job." When he headed ONC, Brailer said he benefited from Blumenthal's advice on health IT adoption.
"He has deep policy capabilities," Brailer said.
Brailer said he hopes ONC will remain a key player and doesn't get co-opted by the federal health IT efforts of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. It's an "open secret" that ONC and CMS were at odds during his term, he said. He is also critical of Congress rushing to put health IT in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). "It puts more risks on healthcare IT adoption than are necessary," he said.
Under ARRA, Congress provides incentives first and then penalties. Citing its track record with regard to Medicare issues, Brailer doesn't believe Congress will follow through with penalties and will either delay or phase them out.
The problem, however, is that the Congressional Budget Office expects $30 billion in additional net bonuses over the next 10 years to come from the penalties.
"It sets up expectations in the market; it confuses the market," he said. "We need to make sure that physicians and hospitals are in a stable, non-erratic market."
While healthcare IT adoption, particularly getting physicians to use true clinical decision support, will continue to be a challenge, "the outcome is obvious," Brailer said. Information technology will eventually carry into the industry.
"Ours was a battle of timing," he said. "The question for government policy is how do we get there faster?" The challenge, he said, is determining how policymakers and industry leaders help create massive transformation with the least disruption for providers and patients.
Expect to see more fragmentation in 2011, Brailer said. "We'll be approaching the peak of the hype cycle," he said. He presages a "real slide back to reality," with the money coming from CMS flowing "slower than everybody thinks."
The pushback to reality is predictable and required with any hype, he said. Despite the challenges and problems ahead, Brailer said, "the problem isn't whether we are making progress. We are."
