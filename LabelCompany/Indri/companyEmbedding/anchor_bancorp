Old National Bank bank acquiring Anchor BanCorp for $461 million





Jan. 12, 2016

Madison-based Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc., revived over the past few years after being on the brink of failure following the Great Recession, is being acquired by Indiana's largest bank for an estimated $461 million.The acquisition, set to close in the second quarter, will eliminate another Wisconsin corporate headquarters and introduce Old National Bank of Evansville, Ind. — and its parent company, Old National Bancorp — to the state's businesses and consumers."Today's transaction is a culmination of the tremendous turnaround at Anchor and a win-win for our communities, customers, employees and shareholders," Chris Bauer, Anchor's president and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the deal Tuesday.Old National CEO Bob Jones said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts that his bank was drawn to Anchor BanCorp's AnchorBank because of its presence in some of Wisconsin's strongest markets and the opportunity to sell its products and services, such as wealth management, to AnchorBank customers. He called Madison "one of the most attractive markets in the Midwest."The deal, which involves 60% stock and 40% cash, gives Old National 46 branches in the state, including offices in the metro Madison and Milwaukee areas and the Fox Valley."What Anchor really is is a great turnaround story. Chris Bauer has done a wonderful job of turning around this franchise with almost a 100-year history, and they represent just a great opportunity for us, particularly the markets they're in," Jones said.The future of AnchorBank looked bleak during and shortly after the recession, as the bank lost millions of dollars quarterly on real estate loans that soured. Bauer, a former Firstar Bank executive in Milwaukee, was brought in during 2009 to try to save the bank. In 2013, Anchor completed a $175 million recapitalization that gave it a fresh start. Anchor filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, which allowed it to cancel $183 million owed to other banks in exchange for $49 million in cash.The reorganization let Anchor wipe out $139 million owed to the U.S. Treasury under its Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, in a deal in which the Treasury received and immediately sold $6 million in Anchor stock.However, about 7,800 shareholders who were still invested in Anchor ended up with nothing in the reorganization. Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin went public again in 2014. The bank was profitable for eight consecutive quarters after the recapitalization."It's hardly a surprise that the institutional investors who backed the recapitalization of AnchorBank a couple of years ago would be interested in liquidity reasonably quickly following the improvements in operating performance that have been achieved there," said Milwaukee-based investment banker Robert Edelman of Edelman & Co. Ltd. "What's more interesting is that Old National won the prize. Some other players may have had concerns relating to the competitive situation in Anchor's home market around Madison."In any case, Edelman said, "It's a positive for the state and industry that Old National, which has been an active acquirer, has chosen to expand into Wisconsin. There's every reason to believe they will be looking to invest more capital here." In an interview Tuesday, Bauer said potential acquirers noticed the turnaround."We got to a point where we had really stabilized as a company, growing, having profitability again," Bauer said. "It grabbed the attention of a number of other institutions and investment bankers. At the end, we kind of had to make a decision, 'Do we start doing mergers, which we were capable of doing, and grow the company ourselves? Or do we find a partner?'" Since the reorganization, AnchorBank has sold off branches in some communities. It also has offered employee buyouts. AnchorBank had about 530 employees through Sept. 3, compared with about 1,000 at the end of 2009, regulatory data shows."We believe this is a very good strategic fit. But probably more importantly, as I mentioned, Chris and his team have done an excellent job. This is a company that is extremely well-positioned for growth," Jones said. "They've done all the hard lifting."Jones said Old National had identified "over 30% in cost savings" from the acquisition.With assets of about $2.2 billion, AnchorBank is the fourth-largest bank based in Wisconsin. Green Bay's Associated Bank, Racine's Johnson Bank and Brown Deer's Bank Mutual are larger. AnchorBank will be converted to the Old National name, and Bauer will stay on for a while to help with the transition, Jones said."It's sort of that last step for me," Bauer said. "On the other hand, there is a great future for AnchorBank — the legacy organization — simply under the name of Old National. Our customers, our communities, our associates, they are all going to be very well-off in this transaction. So I feel like what I'm doing here is handing everything off to a great shepherd of the future. With their products and services and capabilities, I think you're going to see a real dynamic player in the marketplace."Old National has assets of almost $12 billion. In addition to Indiana, Old National has branches in Michigan and Kentucky. It has a few branches in Illinois, but not in the metro Chicago market.Under terms of the agreement, Anchor shareholders may elect to receive either 3.5505 shares of Old National common stock or $48.50 in cash — 14% more than Monday's closing price of $42.54 — for each share of Anchor they hold. No more than 40% of the Anchor shares can be exchanged for cash.Shares of Anchor closed up $1.63 Tuesday at $44.17. Shares of Old National closed down four cents at $12.48.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
