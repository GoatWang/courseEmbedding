Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
 

At Lightstone, we believe investing in large-scale, commercial real estate shouldn’t be limited to large corporations, institutions, or high net worth individuals. Since 2005, Lightstone has offered investors the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate through its various public non-traded REIT offerings.
A real estate investment trust is a company that owns, and in many cases manages, income-producing real estate. Investors purchase shares within the REIT and receive a pro-rata share of income that is derived from the real estate. REITs offer distinct advantages for investors, including: portfolio diversification and income through a transparent and regulated operating structure.
Lightstone’s Non-Traded REIT offerings, include:

Lightstone Value Plus REIT, Inc. (closed to new investors)
Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc. (closed to new investors)
Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc.
Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.

The Real Deal New York














 



 












Lightstone’s new REIT is its first focused purely on NYC development
LREIT will also invest in third-party ground-up projects: Hochberg





















																										By
													Rey Mashayekhi |
													 												

 September 25, 2015 02:10PM












UPDATED, 4:40 p.m., Oct. 5: The Lightstone Group is no stranger to public, non-traded real estate investment trusts geared toward particular markets, having sponsored and launched four separate such funds in the past decade.
But the company’s latest – Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust or LREIT, which kicked off earlier this year – is its first focused specifically on the New York City market, and Lightstone hopes to raise $300 million through the platform for real estate-related investments throughout the city.
“The focus will be Lightstone projects in New York City, [but] it will also be investing with other qualified opportunities as well,” Lightstone president and COO Mitchell Hochberg told The Real Deal.
In 2005, the firm launched its first REIT, Lightstone Value Plus REIT, which invested in residential, hospitality and retail properties. It then launched Lightstone Value Plus REIT II in 2009 and Lightstone Value Plus REIT III in 2014, both focused on select-service hotels.


Lightstone Group

With LREIT, Hochberg said his company sees “an opportunity for the REIT investor to invest in development, particularly in New York City, in a position that can get them a strong return without being [exposed to] the highest level of risk.”
Steven Spinola – the longest-serving president of the Real Estate Board of New York – joined LREIT’s board shortly after his departure from REBNY.
Unlike the previous funds, LREIT will be primarily investing in preferred equity, which the firm believes will reduce risk and deliver more predictable returns for investors. The fund began raising money earlier this year by selling shares through investment advisers – a process that is “going extremely well,” Hochberg said, though he didn’t offer specific figures.
But public, non-traded investment platforms like LREIT aren’t for all types of assets, Hochberg said, citing as an example Lightstone’s acquisition of around 12,000 building lots in Southern Florida, Arizona and Southern California in the post-recession years.
“We bought it thinking it was very opportunistic,” Hochberg said, adding that the assets “had no cash flow” and that it was “difficult to determine what the horizon would be” for them. Such assets, he said, “we wouldn’t even consider putting a REIT into, because we thought it was too high risk. We did that on our own balance sheet.”
While many real estate firms have used the REIT model in a similar fashion to Lightstone – establishing separate, smaller trusts devoted to particular asset classes – Hochberg said his company wasn’t considering the possibility of a wholesale REIT conversion. Forest City Enterprises — the parent company of New York-based Forest City Ratner — is one major company taking that course of action, with the firm expected to complete its REIT conversion at the start of next year.
“I think the biggest advantage to anybody going public is access to capital, typically at costs that would be less than capital available privately,” he said. But there are also “the regulatory issues of being a public company,” Hochberg noted, and the establishment of funds like LREIT enable Lightstone to “access those strategies” of the REIT model without having to compromise its private status.
“For us right now, with interest rates low, the spread between the cost of capital that we could get as a private company – either at an entity level or on a project basis – wouldn’t justify dealing with the issues of being a public company,” he said.
A previous version of this article quoted Mitchell Hochberg specifying shareholder returns expected by LREIT. Lightstone has since retracted those expectations.

Lightstone Gives Birth to Another REIT

David Lichtenstein, Lightstone
Focusing on providing funding sources for development and redevelopment projects, Lightstone has launched Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., a $300 million development finance REIT.
The New York City-based real estate company said the proceeds of the offering would be used to originate, acquire and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related investments that finance development and redevelopment projects.
“Coming out of the economic downturn that began around 2007, the development sector of the real estate industry has been steadily growing with continuous opportunity in new construction projects,” David Lichtenstein, chairman & CEO of Lightstone, said in a prepared statement. “This growing demand allows us to provide loans to developers at a very attractive return-to-investment.”
The company’s statement noted demand for development and/or redevelopment projects has increased, but funding sources haven’t kept pace and traditional lenders have cut back on development financing.
“This presents an opportunity for investment vehicles such as Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.,” the company said about the new public, non-traded REIT.
It is Lightstone’s fourth public, non-traded REIT since 2005. The other three REITs are Lightstone Value Plus REIT, Inc. and Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc., both of which are closed to new investors, and Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc.
Earlier this month, Lightstone announced Steven Spinola, President Emeritus of the Real Estate Board of New York, as an independent director on the Board of Directors of Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust Inc. Spinola retired in June after serving as REBNY president for nearly 30 years, the longest-serving president in the organization’s history and oversaw its growth from 4,000 members in 1986 to more than 16,000 today.
“His integrity coupled with his vast experience in New York City real estate, provides us a tremendous resource offering keen real estate industry experience,” Lichtenstein said in a prepared statement about Spinola’s appointment.
Lightstone is one of the nation’s largest privately-held real estate companies with holdings in 21 states. The company’s $2 billion portfolio includes over 6 million square feet of office, retail and industrial commercial properties; 11,000 residential units and 3,200 hotel keys. It also owns over 12,000 land lots across the United States and has about $1.7 billion worth of projects under development in the residential and hospitality sectors. Many of its development and redevelopment projects have been in New York City, such as 1407 Broadway, a 42-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office building it sold to Shorenstein Properties L.L.C. for $330 million in May. Lightstone had acquired the former Garment Center building in 2007 for $122 million and spent more than $20 million to modernize and reposition it.
