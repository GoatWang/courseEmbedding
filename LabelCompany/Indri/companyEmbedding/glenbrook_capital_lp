I direct that, pursuant to CPR PD 39A para 6.1, no official shorthand note shall be taken of the Judgment and that copies of this version as handed down may be treated as authentic.
Jonathan Hirst QC

 Page 26Jonathan Hirst QC: 1. The Claimant is an investment fund based in Palo Alta, California. Between 2006 and 2008 it purchased through the Defendant, the sole proprietor of a silver business at the London Silver Vaults (``the Silver Vaults'') in Chancery Lane, a large quantity of silver for investment. The silver remained in the Defendant's custody. In April 2011, at the height of the bullion market, the Claimant demanded delivery of the silver by 30 April. Some silver was delivered but there is a dispute as to what was delivered to the Claimant. These proceedings were issued claiming an order for delivery up of the silver and damages for conversion. Freezing orders were granted. Some silver was delivered up to Mr Michael Hore, an independent silver expert, on 14 November 2012 for him to assess and keep in safe custody. That silver was finally released to the Claimant on 24 January 2014. 2. Judgment was entered in default of acknowledgment of service on 9 November 2012, for damages to be assessed. This trial has been the assessment of damages. However it has, in reality, been a full trial because the Court needed to determine what, if any silver, had been converted and what had been delivered to the Claimant after April 2011. It is common ground that 16,699 troy ounces (``ozs'') of sterling silver of .925% purity (``the Glenbrook silver)'' were purchased at a cost of about £170,298 (excluding the cost of some candlesticks) which was paid for by the Claimant. The parties' cases as to what happened to the silver are as follows:- The Claimant contends:(1) 670 ozs were delivered to the Claimant's vault no. 129 at the Silver Vaults and, as is now common ground, a further 10 ozs in the form of about 5 spoons was given to the teenage daughter of a friend of Mr Wickersham. So 680 ozs were not converted.(2) Between 8,825.7 ozs and 8,845.7 ozs, say 8,835 ozs, were delivered to Mr Hore and subsequently to the Claimant. The difference of 20 ozs is dependent on the weight of silver in some items with non-silver blades or handles.(3) The balance of 8,166 ozs has never been accounted for.- The Defendant contends that ultimately all the silver was delivered to the Claimant. Some was delivered as silver bars produced from Glenbrook silver that had been melted down. 3. At a Case Management Conference held on 24 January 2014, Teare J. approved the following list of issues:(1) What items of silverware were bought by the Defendant for the Claimant between 2006 and 2010 (``the items'')?(2) Which if any of the items had been lawfully disposed of prior to the end of April 2011? (3) As at the end of April 2011, what was the value of the items, less the value of any Items within (2) above?(4) Which items were delivered up by the Defendant to Mr Hore?(5) What is/was the value of the Items within (4) above as at their time of release to the Claimant.(6) Which if any of the items were delivered by the Defendant to the Claimant or its agents after the end of April 2011?(7) Which if any of the Items were melted down into silver bars and delivered by the Defendant to the Claimant or its agents after the end of April 2011?(8) What was the value of any items within (6) and (7) above at the time of their delivery to the Claimant?(9) To what if any damages is the Claimant entitled?(10) What if any interest on these damages should be awarded?To these issues, I agreed to add one further issue on the first day of the hearing:(11) To what, if any, profit share was the Defendant entitled? The Claimant was opposed to the Court deciding this further issue but I considered that it arguably fell within (9) and that in any event it was desirable that this issue was decided now, rather than being left for further argument. I was satisfied I could do so justly.4. I heard the following evidence: For the Claimant:Richard Rudgley, the former President of Glenbrook Capital Management, the General Partner of the Claimant.Grover Wickersham, a consultant to the Claimant. He is a member of the California Bar and a director of a US public company.Paul Frankel, a former employee of the Claimant, by witness statement only.Robert Lishman, CEO of the Claimant, by a police statement only.I also read statements by Trudie Protopapas and Christine Vella, solicitors employed by Swinnerton Moore For the Defendant:Mark Hamilton. He is an experienced silver dealer and has been in the business for many years. Hamiltons was a respected business in which his mother and brother were also involved, but for some time he has been the sole proprietor.Richard Inglis, Mr Hamilton's deputy until 2009.Joel Langford, another silver dealer trading in the Silver Vaults.Casey Conway (by witness statement only). He ran businesses called Do Buy 925 Limited and 375 Live Limited and had the facilities and equipment to melt silver flatware into bars.Additionally the Claimant called Mr Michael Hore as an independent expert witness. He also had factual evidence to give. Mr Hore is the principal behind Chester Valuation Company. He had previously run the valuations department for Sotheby's in Chester. 5. My assessment of the witnesses was as follows. Mr Rudgley and Mr Wickersham were honest witnesses doing their best to assist the Court. Mr Wickersham was inclined to ramble from time to time in his evidence. Miss Gilbert mounted a major attack on Mr Wickersham's credibility alleging that he had knowingly made an exaggerated claim because he had not included in his statement any reference to the 10 ozs silver spoons given to the teenage daughter of a friend in the presence of Mr Hamilton (so not in any way secretly) or to two of 14 candlesticks manufactured by the Defendant for Glenbrook but for Mr Wickersham's personal use. These criticisms were not well judged and I reject them. The 10 ozs were on any basis absolutely trivial and had understandably been forgotten by Mr Wickersham (who was not present on the occasion) until he was reminded. As to the two candlesticks, which were ultimately paid for by Mr Wickersham, I am satisfied that they had nothing to do with the Glenbrook silver. They were not manufactured from it, as is evidenced by the costs invoiced by the Defendant which appear to include the bullion price of the silver supplied, and they were rightly not included in Mr Hore's assessment of the Glenbrook silver. 6. Mr Inglis and Mr Langford attended to give oral evidence as a result of witness summonses issued by the Claimant when it appeared doubtful whether they would be called by the Defendant. To accommodate their other business commitments, they were called first. They were patently honest witnesses doing the best they could, but as they were the first to admit that their memories had diminished over the years. 7. I had no reason to disbelieve Mr Conway's evidence, which was very limited indeed. In evidence, Mr Hamilton expressed surprise that his legal team had not asked Mr Conway about a range of other matters and called him to give oral evidence. I should record however that in 1996 he was convicted of cheating the Public Revenue and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. In a subsequent trial he was found by Andrew Popplewell QC (as he was), sitting as a deputy High Court judge, to be an untruthful witness. That may explain why it was decided not to call him...
