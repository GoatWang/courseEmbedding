Greetings Students, Parents, and Guardians,
 
 Welcome to the 2016-2017 school year at T.G. Terry Elementary School. It is both a pleasure and an honor to serve as the Principal of T.G. Terry Elementary School this school year.  Time is a precious product that can never be replaced – we hope that you had time to take care of yourselves and enjoy your family time and friends this summer. Additionally, we would like to “Thank You All” for the time we have been able to serve your sons/daughters, families and community. As we enter into another school year, the faculty and staff are reflective of our past and we look forward to a wonderful year with our school community. 
 I would also like to welcome all of the new students and families to T.G. Terry Elementary School. Terry has a long established tradition of excellence in the Dallas Independent School District. We care about our students and are committed to providing them with a strong educational foundation.  The doors of your school are always open.  We encourage you to visit teachers and classrooms throughout the year.  We also encourage you to become involved in our school by joining the PTA/SBDM and/or becoming a volunteer.  The school’s success depends on the involvement, commitment and support of our parents and community. As you join our campus culture, your development will be supported by our returning students, families, Faculty, Staff and Community Partners to guarantee a successful transition.
T.G. Terry Elementary School has all of the components of an outstanding school:  a dedicated staff; a supportive and caring community; and a body of students who are eager and willing to learn and excel. While we are extremely proud of our accomplishments thus far; our best work is ahead of us and will be demonstrated through our continued quest of excellence with our students, faculty/staff, parents, and community partners.
 We are truly proud of who we are becoming as a school and we make no excuses for who we are and what we expect of ourselves. The core of our work is our campus mission statement which is to effectively teach, challenge, and inspire students to become lifelong learners. We are the Home of the T.G. Terry Terriers where are main purpose is Student Achievement. Thank you for trusting us with your sons/daughters. We look forward to serving each and every one of you.
Respectfully Yours, 
Alicia Bradley
