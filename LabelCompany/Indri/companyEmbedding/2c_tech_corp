Innovative Nanotechnology









Sixteen million Americans suffer from
various ocular diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment,
diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration, which ultimately lead to
diminished sight and eventually blindness. 
The number of such people is growing rapidly as the age of the general
population increases. 

























































2C Tech Corporation, Inc., a Colorado-based biotech company, is developing a medical device based on nanotechnology. The result of this development effort
is the unique, patent pending SeeQ device involving intraocularly delivered
photoactive nanoparticles, particles which convert light to electrical energy,
similar to a conventional solar cell but on a sub-cellular scale.

Who We Are

 
 






In 2005 after surviving hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Robert Owens saw an increase for six straight months of 1000% on his electric bill. This economic wake-up call inspired Robert to examine more efficient methods of conserving electricity while still providing required illumination. His search determined that high brightness LED diodes would be appropriate if applied correctly.




Owens formed a group of seven individuals across multiple countries to design and configure the LED diodes into a fixture that looked like a light bulb and could be sold at an affordable price. Robert and his team had to come up with a new design for the LED bulb, had to figure out how to make it dim with traditional triac dimmers, and had to determine color temperatures.




The team spent a year developing the new technology and building the foundation for most of the LED lighting designs and circuity that are currently on the market. They were responsible for the invention of the LEDt8, LED U-Shape T8, the first Lutron compatible dimming circuit, LED par 30, par 38, par20, and 19 shapes with dimming capabilities.




In 2009 Robert sold his existing business and started his own LED lighting company in order to bring his designs to market. Over the next few years that company grew from 0 customers and four LED designs to 600+ dealers in 14 countries with over 500 new LED designs. In an effort to keep pace with this rapidly expanding market an investment firm was brought in to assist with growth. This didn’t work out and Owens left to incorporate 2C Technology Inc. a year later with a new vision and far superior means of execution.




2C Technology, Inc. is built on Robert’s 21,000+ hours in the LED industry, plus a ten year relationship with his manufacturing partners in China and other countries. He is regarded as a leading industry expert and is regularly sought out on a global level for his insights and vision.




Through a mutually exclusive contract with his global partners, 2C Technology uses Robert’s industrial expertise to co-design new lighting that is specifically tailored for the USA, near the cost of purchasing directly from China. 2C customers now receive some of the best LED products in the world at a cost that enhances their ROI calculations.




2C’s high brightness lights cost less than competitive brands and typically run 2-3 times the efficiency. This means that we can now replace a 1000w metal halide with 100-120w instead of 2-300w like our competitors.

Interview 
	conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published � 
	November 12, 2012
 


CEOCFO: 
Mr. Rao, what is the 
	focus at 2C today?


Mr. Rao: 
We are trying to prevent 
	a number of diseases that cause blindness. These are generally what we call 
	in our business retinal degenerative diseases. That would be things like 
	macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and diabetic retinopathy.

 


CEOCFO: 
What approach are you 
	taking? How does it differ from the approaches that have been taken so far?
	


Mr. Rao: 
This technology that we 
	developed at the University of Colorado is quite unique and quite novel as 
	well. It basically operates on the principal that if you take any 
	degenerating cells in the retina and stimulate them with a small amount of 
	electricity, as a natural defense mechanism they release a whole slew of 
	neurotrophic factors and growth factors, and they in turn protect the cell 
	from degeneration. That is how you arrest the progression of the disease and 
	you may also reverse some of it, but not completely. This approach is pretty 
	unique because we are using neuronal electro stimulationan nanotechnology. 
	We actually inject semiconductor nanoparticles in a suspension into the eye. 
	They migrate into the retina and they convert ordinary light coming into the 
	eye into electricity, therefore you do not need external wires or batteries 
	or any kind of implantation within the retina, none of that. It is minimally 
	non-invasive and quite effective. These nanoparticles clear the eye in about 
	three months and then you have to re-inject them.

 


CEOCFO: 
Are you injecting them 
	right into the eye?


Mr. Rao: 
Yes, we inject them 
	right into the eye; into the vitreous.

 


CEOCFO: 
How do you do that 
	painlessly?  


Mr. Rao: 
You just administer a 
	topical anesthetic. This is not a new thing. Many drugs that are given for 
	retinal diseases today are also injected into the eye. You use a very small 
	thirty gauge needle and you generally do not need anything other than 
	placing a few drops of anesthetic and an antibiotic with the injection. For 
	example, there is a drug called Lucentis for the wet form of macular 
	degeneration. This drug is sold by Genentech Roche. Those are monthly 
	injections for those patients. Each injection costs two thousand dollars and 
	is covered by Medicare.

 


CEOCFO: 
You say this is going to 
	work for a variety of conditions. Is that because the root cause is all the 
	same or covers the same areas?


Mr. Rao: 
The end stage in all of 
	these diseases is that the photo receptor cells, those are the rods and 
	cones in the retina, start degenerating. That is what really leads to the 
	blindness. What we are doing is essentially preventing the degenerating 
	process to continue. Whenever you start the treatment, hopefully that is 
	where the degenerating process will stop.

 


CEOCFO: 
Where are you in the 
	development process?


Mr. Rao: 
We have worked for about 
	four years in the labs in the University working with various animal models. 
	We can work with animal models which exactly mimic the disease process in 
	humans. Through experimentation we try to prove the efficacy and the safety 
	of the device, in terms of anatomic safety, physiological safety and also 
	functional efficacy. It is much more difficult to do functional efficacy in 
	animals but we have tried that. Once we have convinced ourselves that yes, 
	the device is very safe and efficacious, then the device is a safe 
	biomedical and biocompatible device. We already went through some processing 
	steps and since this is such a new and novel technology there is not a lot 
	of know-how here. We are creating it as we go, how to convert nanomaterials 
	that we purchase from someone else into a safe medical device and how to 
	assure that it is biocompatible, not harmful and how to process it without 
	changing its properties. Those are all the processes that we have gone 
	through over the last year to a year and a half and now we are very close to 
	having what we call a clinical product that we can try in humans. This 
	clinical product has been tried on animals again, to assure product safety. 
	Once we know that it is safe in animals we will provide that data to 
	institutions that will evaluate the data.  If they consider that it is safe 
	then they will allow for injection into humans. Initial patients in the 
	Study will be nearly blind patients, or almost blind patients. We will 
	assure ourselves of safety first and then gradually we will inject it into 
	people who have a slight amount of sight.

 


CEOCFO: 
Is there a lot of 
	research being done in this area? Is the community aware of what 2C has been 
	working on? 


Mr. Rao: 
At least, in 
	ophthalmology, a number of people are aware of it. The problem that we are 
	trying to solve is quite huge. These are large indications. In the US alone 
	there are approximately sixteen million people who are going blind. They 
	have nothing available today; no device, no approved drug and device. 
	Therefore, these are the indications that attract investment. There is a lot 
	of activity. One that comes closest to ours is a company also in this area 
	called �Second Sight�. They actually surgically implant a silicone chip in 
	the retina. They have to provide external power for it and it also works on 
	the principal of electrical stimulation of the surrounding cells. That 
	company is on the verge of getting FDA approval now.  Because of the high 
	risk of the surgery they are only implanting it in people who are blind. It 
	would sell for about one hundred thousand dollars.

 


CEOCFO: 
That is a vast 
	comparison from what you are able to do!


Mr. Rao: 
That is right. 


 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you increase awareness in the opthamologic community? 


Mr. Rao: 
We need to have a human 
	data. This is an important milestone. That is when we will receive a lot of 
	interest from strategic partners and first tier venture capital companies. 
	That is when they consider a device as a serious device, because now a lot 
	of technology risk has been taken off of the table.

 


CEOCFO: 
Development is always 
	expensive. How far will your current funding take 2C Tech Corporation?


Mr. Rao: 
Right now, we are in the 
	early stages of negotiation with a strategic company.  If they do invest 
	with us, which will happen in the next couple of months, if it does happen 
	then in about a year from now we will be able to prove the efficacy and 
	safety in small clinical trials in humans. That is about a fifteen month 
	away. We have sufficient funding to go through that process with this 
	partnership.

 


CEOCFO: 
What is happening day to 
	day in the company? 


Mr. Rao: 
We are working on two or 
	three different fronts. About a third of the activity is in financing. Right 
	now, we are more focused on working with this company which is in the 
	diligence phase, that we supply whatever information they need in order to 
	conduct their diligence, working with their consultants and so on. That 
	takes about a third of the time. Maybe another twenty percent of the time 
	devoted to, day to day, working with out patent counsels. We have about two 
	patents to be filed. They are filed through the University of Colorado and 
	we license them. Those patents are now just starting to receive office 
	action, both in the European office as well as in US, so now we are in a 
	mode to respond to their questions and cover their objections and all of 
	that.  We are going through that process with our patent counsel. Rest of 
	the time has to do with product development effort. One of the issues that 
	we had in the past in acquiring materials from the vendors, some of the 
	materials had some undesirable aspects. Now we are working with the vendors 
	and trying to resolve some of those issues and improving on the process so 
	that we will have the clinical products for clinical trials within the next 
	four of five months. We are going through all of those steps. We are working 
	with a number of vendors on that.

 


CEOCFO: 
How do you deal, 
	personally and as a company, with the frustration that it takes so long to 
	get an idea into trials and usage, when you feel that you have something 
	that could really make such a major difference for people?


Mr. Rao: 
That is such a good 
	question. If you have been in this business for as long as I have, this 
	becomes almost a part of your DNA. It gets into your DNA. You recognize that 
	it takes a long time. There is a lot of risk that investors, VC�s are 
	unwilling to assume, particularly after the 2007 financial disaster, most of 
	the venture community has become so conservative. They are reluctant to look 
	at any company that is considered an early. Whatever funds they do have, 
	they are allocating to companies that they are already in and companies in 
	clinical stage. They can do this because they have the luxury right now. 
	What we are finding out,  that surprised me, is that there is now some 
	funding available from various government sources; such as state governments 
	and SBIR-NIH. Some of these funding sources have become a little bit more 
	available than ever before. They have also become practical for many early 
	stage companies. We did raise quite a bit of money from the State of 
	Colorado. Some of the universities are also funding university based 
	research. We have done that, too. We also raised funds from high net worth 
	individuals who can put seed capital. In some cases philanthropic 
	organizations focused on a particular disease - they are also making small 
	investments in novel companies. We basically had to run around a lot. You 
	find out that a disproportionate amount of your time really goes on hunting 
	and chasing the capital rather than working on the technology. Your question 
	is good because, as a society we should ask ourselves how we really fund 
	innovation. How do we really identify a novelty quite quickly and fund it. 
	We just do not have a good mechanism. 

 


CEOCFO: 
Why should investors and 
	people in the business community pay attention to 2C Tech?


	Mr. Rao: 
It is a very innovative 
	idea. It is proven safe and effective already in animals models. The 
	evidence is overwhelmingly strong. There is good probability that the 
	technology will be practical, because there are already similar devices, 
	much more expensive and invasive already proven effective in humans. The 
	probability that this will work in humans in extremely high and the 
	milestones that we need to achieve are not too far away. Therefore, it is an 
	excellent investment.
