Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with ("item 8:Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"), which contains our financial statements.  The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership and formed on April 8, 2008 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resources Partners, L.P. ("ARP")

                                         and its midstream subsidiary, Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. ("APL"), entered into definitive agreements to be acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP, respectively. Immediately prior to the acquisition, Atlas Energy distributed to its unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, which changed its name to Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("New Atlas") and became a separate, publicly traded company as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, New Atlas continues to hold the Partnership's business as well as ARP's general partner interest and incentive distribution rights, and now holds the non-midstream assets and ARP limited partner units previously held by Atlas Energy.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Indiana. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy (after February 27, 2015, New Atlas), for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  ? Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  ? Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  ? Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2014, our MGP withheld $23,700 of net production revenue for this purpose.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and 2013, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. The MGP markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third-party plant operators who process and market the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The production area and pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Transco Leidy Line.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, Chevron Natural Gas accounted for approximately 96% of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and early 2015, particularly in December 2014 and January 2015. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 5,542 $ 7,130 Oil 5 20 Liquids - 26 Total $ 5,547 $ 7,176 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 4,529 5,220 Oil (bbls/day) 1 1 Liquids (bbls/day) - 2 Total (mcfe/day) 4,535 5,238 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 3.46 $ 4.26 Oil (per bbl) $ 89.88 $ 80.12 Liquids (per bbl) $ - $ 40.45 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 41 % 43 % Per mcfe $ 1.37 $ 1.61 Depletion per mcfe $ 1.18 $ 1.38  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $183,300 and $978,600 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $5,541,700 and $7,130,200 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $1,588,500 (22%). The $1,588,500 decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $943,600 decrease in production volumes and a $644,900 decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 4,529 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 5,220 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of 691 (13%) mcf per day. The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (See Item 1:  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $4,900 and $19,600 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $14,700 (75%). The $14,700 decrease in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $15,300 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $600 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to .15 bbl per day for the year ended December 31, 2014 from .67 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of .52 bbl per day (78%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $26,600 for the year ended December 31, 2013. There were no natural gas liquid revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $2,268,700 and $3,081,200 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $812,500 (26%). This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in transportation fees which was partially offset by an increase in water hauling and disposal fees.  Depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 35% and 37% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties.  General and administrative expenses were $104,100 and $126,900 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $22,800 (18%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us.  Impairments of gas and oil properties for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $297,500 and $270,100, respectively. Annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Sale of Gas and Oil Properties. On December 30, 2013, the Partnership sold its gas and oil properties in the Antrim Shale geological formation mostly located in Michigan with a net book value of $298,900 for $369,000. Cash proceeds from the sale will be distributed to the partnership unit holders in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. As a result of the sale, $5,412,600 of gas and oil properties, $5,015,900 of accumulated depletion and impairment, and $97,800 of asset retirement obligations were removed from the partnership accounts resulting in a net gain of $70,100.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $1,317,300 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3,976,700 as compared to $5,294,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income before depletion, impairment, accretion and a decrease in the non-cash loss on derivative value of $1,659,500. In addition, the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $431,600 and the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate decreased $23,700. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $620,400, the change in accrued liabilities of $107,000 and the change in gain on sale of oil and gas properties of $70,100 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.  Cash provided by investing activities was $373,900 for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting from proceeds from the sale of miscellaneous tangible equipment of $9,400 and the proceeds from the sale of the Partnership's Michigan oil and gas properties of $369,000, partially offset by a purchase of tangible equipment of $4,500. Cash used in investing activities was $440,400 for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting from the net of $12,800 in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $453,200 for the purchase of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $199,800 to $4,704,400 for the year ended December 31, 2014, from $4,904,200 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through December 31, 2014, our MGP withheld $23,700 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Impairment  During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $297,500 and $270,100, respectively, of impairments related to gas and oil properties. These impairments related to the carrying amount of our gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013. The estimates of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (See "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on activities, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have naturally occurring radioactivity, and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  SECURED HEDGE FACILITY  The MGP has a secured hedge facility agreement with a syndicate of banks under which the Partnership has the ability to enter into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price movements. Under the MGP's revolving credit facility the Partnership is required to utilize this secured hedge facility for future commodity risk management activity. The Partnership's obligations under the facility are secured by mortgages on its gas and oil properties and first priority security interests in substantially all of its assets and by a guarantee of the MGP. The MGP administers the commodity price risk management activity for the Partnership under the secured hedge facility. The secured hedge facility agreement contains covenants that limit the Partnership's ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions if a default under the secured hedge facility agreement exists or would result from the distribution, merge into or consolidate with other persons, enter into commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts, or engage in certain asset dispositions including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. As of December 31, 2014 only the Partnership's natural gas swaps are included in the secured hedge facility.  In addition, it will be an event of default under the MGP's revolving credit facility if it, as our general partner, breaches an obligation governed by the secured hedge facility and the effect of such breach is to cause amounts owing under swap agreements governed by the secured hedge facility to become immediately due and payable.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, impairment, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements (see "item 8:Financial Statements"), included in this report. The critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below.  Depletion and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-Lived Assets. The cost of natural gas and oil properties, less estimated salvage value, is generally depleted on the units-of-production method.  Natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. The undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions, including natural gas and oil prices, production and operating expenses. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. As discussed in General Trends and Outlook within this section, recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices. Further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.  During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $297,500 and $270,100 of impairments within natural gas and oil properties. These impairments related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices at the date of measurement.  Events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include, among other factors: operating losses; unused capacity; market value declines; technological developments resulting in obsolescence; changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products; changes in competition and competitive practices; uncertainties associated with the United States and world economies; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; and changes in governmental regulations or actions.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  We have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership's own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  . . .

Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P. Investment Losses




(Last Updated On: April 5, 2017)Are you concerned about your losses investing in Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P.? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses.
According to their website, Atlas Resources Partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors.  The company often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P. These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%, as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from 1-3%.
Atlas Resources Partners LP filed for bankruptcy protection on July 26 and joins dozens of struggling oil and gas producers that were pushed into Chapter 11 after energy prices began dropping in 2014. Since the beginning of 2015, at least 85 North American oil and gas producers have defaulted, according to Haynes & Boone LLP. Those cases involve about $61.2 billion in cumulative debt, the law firm said in a June 30 report.
The trouble with alternative investment products, like Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P., is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.  An additional risk inherent to Atlas Resource Partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities.
The White Law Group continues to investigate the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commission and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresentation the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Atlas Resources Public #18-2009 (B) L.P. or another Atlas Resource Partners private placement investment, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.

Atlas
Resources Public #18-2008 Program

Supplement
No. 1
to
the
Prospectus
dated August 11, 2009

September
24, 2009

This
supplement forms a part of, and must be accompanied or preceded by, the
prospectus.��You should carefully review the prospectus and this
supplement before subscribing for units.
�
The
purpose of this supplement is to:





�������


update
  the status of the offering of units in Atlas Resources Public #18-2009(C)
  L.P. (the �partnership�); and




�




�������


provide
  a risk factor dealing with the possible replacement of some or all of the
  proposed wells in Appendix A � Information Regarding Currently Proposed
  Prospects (�Appendix A�) in the prospectus as a result of the future price
  of natural gas, which cannot be predicted with
  certainty.




�
Status of the
Offering.��The program is currently offering units in Atlas
Resources Public #18-2009(C) L.P. (the �partnership�).��The
partnership had received subscriptions of $2,005,300.00 from 65 investors, all
of whom are investor general partners and none of whom are limited partners as
of September 17, 2009.��These subscriptions meet its minimum offering
proceeds of $2,000,000 and are sufficient to break escrow and began its drilling
operations.
�
Risk Factor.��During
the course of 2009, the spot market price of natural gas decreased to its lowest
level since September 2002.��In this regard, whether a proposed well
is drilled depends on the managing general partner�s analysis of many factors,
including the current spot market price of natural gas, the price of natural gas
on the futures market, the hedges that affiliates of the managing general
partner have entered into with respect to the future price of natural gas, the
anticipated cost to drill the well and the expected volume of production of
natural gas from the well.��With respect to the proposed prospects to
be drilled, the managing general partner generally places more emphasis on the
anticipated future market price of natural gas since significant production of
natural gas from the wells that the partnership will drill will not begin until
the first quarter of 2010.��There is a risk that the managing general
partner may not be able to correctly analyze the factors set forth above, but
the managing general partner believes that if the price of natural gas on the
futures market declines over the partnership�s scheduled drilling period, then
some or all of the wells specified in Appendix A in the prospectus may be
uneconomical to drill.��Thus, some or all of the wells specified in
Appendix A may not be drilled by the partnership, and the specified wells that
are drilled, if any, may become uneconomical to operate in the
future.��See �Risk Factors � Risks Related to the Partnership�s Oil
and Gas Operations � Partnership Distributions May be Reduced if There is a
Decrease in the Price of Natural Gas and Oil� and Appendix A regarding the
managing general partner�s ability to withdraw and substitute the prospects in
the prospectus.

NOTE
1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Atlas
Resources Public 18-2009 (B) L.P. (the “Partnership”) is a Delaware Limited
Partnership which includes Atlas Resources, LLC of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as
Managing General Partner ("MGP") and Operator, and 3,240 Limited Partners or
Investor General Partners. The Partnership was formed on April 8, 2008 to drill
and operate gas wells located primarily in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan and
Tennessee. The Partnership has no employees and relies on its MGP for management
which, in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Resources, LLC,
("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services. On September 29, 2009, Atlas
Energy Resources, LLC and Atlas America, Inc. (“Atlas America”) (NASDAQ: ATLS)
merged with Atlas Energy Resources, LLC becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of
Atlas America. In addition, Atlas America changed its name to “Atlas Energy,
Inc.”

The
financial statements as of September 30, 2009 are unaudited. Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements
include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the
interim periods presented. Management has considered for disclosure any
material subsequent events through November 16, 2009, the date the
financial statements were issued. The results of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2009 may not necessarily be indicative of the results of
operations for the period ended December 31, 2009. Partnership operations began
April 16, 2009.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

Preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses
during the reporting period. The Partnership’s financial statements are based on
a number of significant estimates, including revenue and expense accruals,
depletion, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of
forecasted transactions. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Possible Losses

In
evaluating the need for an allowance for possible losses, the Partnership's MGP,
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits
based upon payment history and the customer’s current creditworthiness, as
determined by review of its customers' credit information. Credit is extended on
an unsecured basis to many of its energy customers. At September 30, 2009, the
Partnership's MGP's credit evaluation indicated that the Partnership has no need
for an allowance for possible losses.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Partnership generally sells natural gas and crude oil at prevailing market
prices.  Revenue is recognized when produced quantities are delivered
to a custody transfer point, persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists,
the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery,
collection of revenue from the sale are reasonably assured and the sales price
is fixed or determinable.  Revenues from the production of natural gas
and crude oil in which the Partnership has an interest with other producers are
recognized on the basis of the Partnership’s percentage ownership of working
interest or overriding royalty. Generally, the Partnership’s sales contracts are
based on pricing provisions that are tied to a market index, with certain
adjustments based on proximity to gathering and transmission lines and the
quality of its natural gas.

NOTE

Because
there are timing differences between the delivery of the Partnership’s natural
gas and oil and the receipt of a delivery statement, the Partnership has
unbilled revenues. These revenues are accrued based upon volumetric data from
the Partnership’s records and estimates of the related transportation and
compression fees which are, in turn, based upon applicable product prices. The
Partnership had unbilled trade receivables of $3,407,000 at September 30, 2009
which are included in Accounts receivable-affiliate on the Partnership's Balance
Sheets.

Oil
and Gas Properties

The
Partnership follows the successful-efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
producing activities. Oil and gas properties are recorded at
cost.  Depletion is determined on a field-by-field basis using the
units-of-production method for well and related equipment costs based on proved
developed reserves associated with each field. Depletion rates are determined
based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of developed
producing properties.  In addition, accumulated depletion includes
impairment adjustments to reflect the write-down to fair market value of the oil
and gas properties. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Major
renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of the property are
capitalized. Oil is converted to gas equivalent basis (“Mcfe”) at the rate one
barrel equals 6 thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”).

Upon the
sale or retirement of a complete field of a proved property, the cost is
eliminated from the property accounts, and the resultant gain or loss is
recorded in operations. Upon the sale or retirement of an individual well, the
net book value is credited to accumulated depletion.

Impairment
of Oil and Gas Properties and Long-Lived Assets

The
Partnership’s oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment annually or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. Oil and gas properties are reviewed for potential
impairments at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash
flows.

The
review of the Partnership’s oil and gas properties is done on a field-by-field
basis by determining if the historical cost of proved properties less the
applicable accumulated depletion and abandonment is less than the estimated
expected undiscounted future cash flows. The expected future cash flows are
estimated based on the Partnership’s plans to continue to produce and develop
proved reserves. Expected future cash flow from the sale of production of
reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices. The Partnership
estimates prices based upon current contracts in place, adjusted for basis
differentials and market related information including published futures prices.
The estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding
future levels of prices and costs, field decline rates, market demand and
supply, and the economic and regulatory climates. If the carrying value exceeds
such cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the
estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted future cash flows), and
the carrying value of the assets.

The
determination of oil and natural gas reserve estimates is a subjective process,
and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available
data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and
judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash
flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult
to predict and may vary considerably from actual results.  In addition, reserve
estimates for wells with limited or no production history are less reliable than
those based on actual production.  Estimated reserves are often
subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the
availability of additional information which could cause the assumptions to be
modified.  The Partnership cannot predict what reserve revisions may
be required in future periods. There were no
impairments of oil and gas properties recorded by the Partnership for the three
months and period ended September 30, 2009.

Working
Interest

The
Partnership agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated
to the MGP and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to
total contributions, (“the working interest”). The MGP is also provided an
additional working interest of 10% as provided in the Partnership Agreement. Due
to the time necessary to complete drilling operations and accumulate all
drilling costs, estimated working interest percentage ownership rates are
utilized to allocate revenues and expenses until the wells are completely
drilled and turned on-line into production. Once the wells are completed, the
final working interest ownership of the partners is determined, and any
previously allocated revenues and expenses based on the estimated working
interest percentage ownership are adjusted to conform to the final working
interest percentage ownership.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards

In August
2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update 2009-05, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) – Measuring Liabilities at Fair
Value (“Update 2009-05”). Update 2009-05 amends subtopic 820-10, “Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures- Overall” and provides clarification for the
fair value measurement of liabilities in circumstances where quoted prices for
an identical liability in an active market are not available. The amendments
also provide clarification for not requiring the reporting entity to include
separate inputs or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of a
restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability when estimating the fair
value of a liability.  Additionally, these amendments clarify that
both the quoted price in an active market for an identical liability at the
measurement date and the quoted price for an identical liability when traded as
an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the
asset are required are considered Level 1 fair value measurements. These
requirements are effective for financial statements issued after the release of
Update 2009-05.  The Partnership adopted the requirements on September
30, 2009 and it did not have a material impact on its financial position,
results of operations or related disclosures.

In June
2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-01, Topic 105- Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles Amendments Based on Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 168- The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy
of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Update 2009-01”). Update
2009-01 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) as the
single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities.  The
ASC supersedes all existing non-Securities and Exchange Commission accounting
and reporting standards.  Following the ASC, the FASB will not issue
new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging
Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, the FASB will issue Accounting Standards
Updates, which will serve only to update the ASC.  ASC 105 is
effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending
after September 15, 2009.  Entities are not required to include
specific references to the ASC in their financial statements and, therefore, the
Partnership has removed all previous references to FASB authoritative guidance
and describes its accounting policies using a “plain English” approach. The
Partnership adopted the requirements of Update 2009-01 to its financial
statements on September 30, 2009 and it did not have a material impact to the
Partnership’s financial statement disclosures.

In May
2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events (“ASC
855-10”). ASC 855-10 establishes general standards of accounting for and
disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The provisions
require management of a reporting entity to evaluate events or transactions that
may occur after the balance sheet date for potential recognition or disclosure
in the financial statements and provides guidance for disclosures that an entity
should make about those events. ASC 855-10 is effective for interim or annual
financial periods ending after June 15, 2009 and shall be applied prospectively.
The Partnership adopted the requirements of this standard on June 30, 2009 and
it did not have a material impact to its financial position or results of
operations or related disclosures. The adoption of these provisions does not
change the Partnership’s current practices with respect to evaluating, recording
and disclosing subsequent events.

In April
2009, the FASB issued ASC 820-10-65-4, Determining Fair Value When the
Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (“ASC
820-10-65-4”). ASC 820-10-65-4 applies to all fair value measurements and
provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market
activity for an asset has declined significantly.  ASC 820-10-65-4
also require an entity to disclose a change in valuation technique and related
inputs to the valuation calculation and to quantify its effects, if practicable.
ASC 820-10-65-4 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June
15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
The Partnership adopted the requirements of ASC 820-10-65-4 on April 1, 2009 and
its adoption did not have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial
position and results of operations.

In April
2009, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value
of Financial Instruments (“ASC 825-10-65-1”), which requires an entity to
provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
financial information. In addition, an entity shall disclose in the body or in
the accompanying notes of its summarized financial information for interim
reporting periods and in its financial statements for annual reporting periods
the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value, whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of
financial position. ASC 825-10-65-1 is effective for interim periods ending
after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after
March 15, 2009. The Partnership adopted these requirements on April 1, 2009 and
its adoption did not have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial
position and results of operations.

Modernization
of Oil and Gas Reporting

In
December 2008, the SEC announced that it had approved revisions to its oil and
gas reporting disclosures by adopting amendments to Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X
and Items 201, 801, and 802 of Regulation S-K. These new disclosure requirements
are referred to as “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” and include
provisions that:





·  


Introduce
      a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition
      allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from
      unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen
      extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and
      shale formations.








·  


Report
      oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior
      12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each
      month, rather than year-end pricing. This should maximize the
      comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate the
      distortion of the estimates that arises when using a single pricing
      date.








·  


Permit
      companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary
      basis. Current rules limit disclosure to only proved
    reserves.

·  


Update
      and revise reserve definitions to reflect changes in the oil and gas
      industry and new technologies. New updated definitions include “by
      geographic area” and “reasonable
certainty.”








·  


Permit
      the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those
      technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable
      conclusions about reserves volumes.








·  


Require
      additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical
      person who oversees the Partnership’s overall reserve estimation process.
      Additionally, disclosures are required related to internal controls over
      reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and
      qualifications of a Partnership’s  reserves preparer or auditor
      based on Society of Petroleum Engineers
  criteria.




The
Partnership will begin complying with the disclosure requirements in its annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. The new rules may not
be applied to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report
in which the revised disclosures are required. The Partnership is currently in
the process of evaluating the new requirements.

NOTE
3 - TRANSACTIONS WITH ATLAS RESOURCES, LLC AND ITS AFFILIATES

The
Partnership has entered into the following significant transactions with its MGP
and its affiliates as provided under its Partnership agreement:





·  


Administrative
      costs which are included in general and administrative expenses in the
      Partnership’s Statements of Net Earnings are payable at $75 per well per
      month. Administrative costs incurred for the three months and period ended
      September 30, 2009 were $5,000 and $5,200,
  respectively.








·  


Monthly
      well supervision fees which are included in production expenses in the
      Partnership’s Statements of Net Earnings are payable at $975 per well per
      month for Marcellus wells and $1,500 per well per month for New Albany and
      Indiana Wells. For all other wells a fee of $392 is charged per well per
      month, for operating and maintaining the wells. Well supervision fees
      incurred for the three months and period ended September 30, 2009 were
      $59,900 and $63,700, respectively.








·  


Transportation
      fees which are included in production expenses in the Partnership's
      Statements of Net Earnings are generally payable at 13% of the natural gas
      sales price. Transportation fees incurred for the three months and period
      ended September 30, 2009 were $677,500 and $679,300,
      respectively.








·  


Assets
      contributed from the MGP which are disclosed on the Partnership’s
      Statement of Cash Flows as a non-cash activity for the period ended
      September 30, 2009 were $7,763,900. The $7,763,900 of assets contributed
      is net of $13,915,300 adjustment for syndication and offering costs to
      reflect net costs directly attributable to oil and gas
      properties.




The MGP
and its affiliates perform all administrative and management functions for the
Partnership including billing revenues and paying expenses. “Accounts
receivable-affiliate” on the Partnership's Balance Sheet represents the net
production revenues due from the MGP.

Subordination
by Managing General Partner

Under the
terms of the Partnership agreement, the MGP may be required to subordinate up to
50% of its share of net production revenues of the Partnership to provide a
distribution to the investor partners equal to at least 10% of their agreed
subscriptions. Subordination is determined on a cumulative basis, in each of the
first five years of Partnership operations, commencing with the first
distribution of net revenues to the investor partners.

NOTE

Comprehensive
income includes net earnings and all other changes in equity of a business
during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources. These changes, other than net earnings, are referred to as

NOTE
5 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The
Partnership is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business
operations. The risk is managed by using derivative instruments related to
commodity price risk. Forward contracts on natural gas and oil are entered into
to manage the price risk associated with forecasted sales of natural gas and
crude oil. The Partnership designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges and
the derivative instruments have been recorded as either assets or liabilities at
fair value on the balance sheet. The effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
reclassified to earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative
instruments as of September 30, 2009 as well as the gain or loss recognized for
the three months and period ended September 30, 2009. There were no gains or
losses recognized in income for ineffective derivative instruments for the three
months and period ended September 30, 2009.

Atlas
Energy, on behalf of the Partnership, from time to time enters into natural gas
and crude oil future option and collar contracts to hedge exposure to changes in
natural gas prices and oil prices. At any point in time, such contracts may
include regulated New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) futures, options
contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter futures contracts with qualified
counterparties. NYMEX contracts are generally settled with offsetting positions,
but may be settled by the delivery of natural gas. These contracts have
qualified and been designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at their fair
values.

At
September 30, 2009, the Partnership reflected a net hedge asset on its Balance
Sheet of $2,211,100. Of the remaining $2,211,100 net unrealized gain in
accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2009, if the fair values
of the instruments remain at current market values, the Partnership will
reclassify $1,441,500 of net gains to its Statements of Net Earnings over the
next twelve month period as these contracts settle, and $769,600 of net gains in
later periods. Actual amounts that will be reclassified will vary as a result of
future price changes. Ineffective hedge gains or losses are recorded within the
Statements of Net Earnings while the hedge contract is open and may increase or
decrease until settlement of the contract. The Partnership recognized no gains
or losses during the three months and period ended September 30, 2009 for hedge
ineffectiveness or as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow
hedges.

NOTE
6 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Partnership has established a hierarchy to measure its financial instruments at
fair value which requires it to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy
defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value.

Level 1– Quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity
has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2– Inputs other than
quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and
liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially
the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.

Level 3– Unobservable inputs
that reflect the entities own assumptions about the assumptions that market
participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are
consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular
valuation techniques.

Assets
and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The
Partnership has certain assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value
on a recurring basis in its balance sheets. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate fair values.

All of
the Partnership’s derivatives contracts are defined as Level 2. The
Partnership's natural gas and crude oil derivative contracts are valued based on
prices quoted on the NYMEX or WTI and adjusted by the respective counterparty
using various assumptions including quoted forward prices, time value,
volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
Information for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis at September 30, 2009 is as follows.

Assets
and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

The
Partnership has certain assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis in its Balance Sheet. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate fair values.

Asset Retirement
Obligations.  The Partnership estimates the fair value of asset
retirement obligations based on discounted cash flow projections using numerous
estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors at the date of
establishment of an asset retirement obligation such as: amounts and timing of
settlements; the credit adjusted risk free rate of the Partnership; and
estimated inflation rates. There were new asset retirement obligations incurred
for the three months and period ended September 30, 2009 is as
follows:

NOTE
7 - ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

The
Partnership recognizes an estimated liability for the plugging and abandonment
of its oil and gas wells and related facilities. It also recognizes a liability
for future asset retirement obligations if a reasonable estimate of the fair
value of that liability can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The
Partnership also considers the estimated salvage value in the calculation of
depreciation, depletion and amortization.

The
estimated liability is based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning
wells, estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates,
external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future,
and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted using
an assumed credit- adjusted risk-free
interest rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in
estimates of plugging and abandonment costs or remaining lives of the wells, or
if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment
requirements.

The
Partnership has no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset
retirement obligations.  Except for its oil and gas properties, the
Partnership has determined that there are no other material retirement
obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for plugging and abandonment costs
for the periods indicated is as follows:

statements.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial
Statements and the Notes to our Financial Statements.

General

We were
formed as a Delaware limited partnership on April 16, 2009, with Atlas
Resources, LLC as our Managing General Partner, or MGP, to drill natural gas
development wells. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management,
which in turn relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Resources, LLC
(NYSE:ATN), or Atlas Energy, for administrative services. On September 29, 2009
Atlas Energy completed its merger with Atlas America, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATLS). In
addition, Atlas America changed its name to Atlas Energy, Inc.

Our wells
are currently producing natural gas and, to a far lesser extent, oil which are
our only products. Most of our gas is gathered and delivered to market through
Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC’s gas gathering system, a newly formed
joint-venture between Atlas Energy’s affiliate, Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P.
(NYSE:APL) and The Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). We do not plan to sell any of
our wells and will continue to produce them until they are depleted or become
uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or
sold.

Results
of Operations

Partnership
operations began April 16, 2009. The Partnership's first wells were turned
on-line in June 9, 2009; therefore no comparative data is available for the nine
months ended September 30, 2008.

The
following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues,
volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods
indicated:

Natural Gas
Revenues.  Our natural gas revenues were $5,711,100 and
$5,724,600 for the three months and period ended September 30, 2009,
respectively. We expect that our natural gas revenues will increase over the
next year, as more of our wells are put on-line and are producing larger volumes
of natural gas.

Oil Revenues. We drill wells
primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have oil
production. Our oil revenues were $1,100 for the three months and period ended
September 30, 2009, respectively. We expect that our oil revenues will increase
over the next year, as more of our wells are put on-line and are producing
larger volumes of oil.

Expenses.  Production
expenses were $1,112,600 and $1,118,500 for the three months and period ended
September 30, 2009, respectively.

Depletion
was estimated as a percentage of revenues were 40% for the three months and
period ended September 30, 2009, respectively.

General
and administrative expenses were $26,400 and $31,100 for the three months and
period ended September 30, 2009, respectively. These expenses include
third-party costs, audit, tax and other outside services as well as the monthly
administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the
timing and billing of the costs and services provided to the
Partnership.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Cash used
in investing activities was $122,554,200 during the period ended September 30,
2009. This consisted of oil and gas well drilling contracts paid to
MGP.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $122,554,200 during the period ended
September 30, 2009. This was due to Partners’ capital contribution.

Our MGP
may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional
funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from
our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans
to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total
subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.

The
Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash
flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future
operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no
need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are
based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an
on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset
retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and
liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Subordination
by Managing General Partner

Under the
terms of the Partnership agreement, the MGP may be required to subordinate up to
50% of its share of net production revenues of the Partnership to provide a
distribution to the investor partners equal to at least 10% of their agreed
subscriptions. Subordination is determined on a cumulative basis, in each of the
first five years of Partnership operations, commencing with the first
distribution of net revenues to the investor partners.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards

In August
2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2009-05, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) – Measuring Liabilities at Fair
Value an Update 2009-05. Update 2009-05 amends subtopic 820-10, “Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures- Overall” and provides clarification for the
fair value measurement of liabilities in circumstances where quoted prices for
an identical liability in an active market are not available. The amendments
also provide clarification for not requiring the reporting entity to include
separate inputs or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of a
restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability when estimating the fair
value of a liability. Additionally, these amendments clarify that both the
quoted price in an active market for an identical liability at the measurement
date and the quoted price for an identical liability when traded as an asset in
an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are
required are considered Level 1 fair value measurements. These requirements are
effective for financial statements issued after the release of Update 2009-05.
We adopted the requirements on September 30, 2009 and it did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or related
disclosures.

In June
2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-01, Topic 105- Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles Amendments Based on Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 168- The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy
of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles an Update 2009-01. Update
2009-01 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or ASC as the
single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The ASC
supersedes all existing non-Securities and Exchange Commission accounting and
reporting standards.  Following the ASC, the FASB will not issue new
standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues
Task Force Abstracts. Instead, the FASB will issue Accounting Standards Updates,
which will serve only to update the ASC. ASC 105 is effective for financial
statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15,
2009. Entities are not required to include specific references to the ASC in
their financial statements and, therefore, we have removed all previous
references to FASB authoritative guidance and describes our accounting policies
using a “plain English” approach. We adopted the requirements of Update 2009-01
to our financial statements on September 30, 2009 and it did not have a material
impact to our financial statement disclosures.

In May
2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events or ASC
855-10.  ASC 855-10 establishes general standards of accounting for
and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The provisions
require management of a reporting entity to evaluate events or transactions that
may occur after the balance sheet date for potential recognition or disclosure
in the financial statements and provides guidance for disclosures that an entity
should make about those events. ASC 855-10 is effective for interim or annual
financial periods ending after June 15, 2009 and shall be applied
prospectively.  We adopted the requirements of this standard on June
30, 2009 and it did not have a material impact to our financial position or
results of operations or related disclosures. The adoption of these provisions
does not change our current practices with respect to evaluating, recording and
disclosing subsequent events.

In April
2009, the FASB issued ASC 820-10-65-4, Determining Fair Value When the
Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly or ASC
820-10-65-4. ASC 820-10-65-4 applies to all fair value measurements and provides
additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for
an asset has declined significantly. ASC 820-10-65-4 also require an entity to
disclose a change in valuation technique and related inputs to the valuation
calculation and to quantify its effects, if practicable. ASC 820-10-65-4 is
effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early
adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. We adopted the
requirements of ASC 820-10-65-4 on April 1, 2009 and its adoption did not have a
material impact on our financial position and results of
operations.


 



21
 



 




In April
2009, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value
of Financial Instruments or ASC 825-10-65-1, which requires an entity to
provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
financial information. In addition, an entity shall disclose in the body or in
the accompanying notes of its summarized financial information for interim
reporting periods and in its financial statements for annual reporting periods
the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value, whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of
financial position. ASC 825-10-65-1 is effective for interim periods ending
after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after
March 15, 2009.  We adopted these requirements on April 1, 2009 and
its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position and
results of operations.

Modernization
of Oil and Gas Reporting

In
December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC announced that it
had approved revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures by adopting
amendments to Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X and Items 201, 801, and 802 of
Regulation S-K. These new disclosure requirements are referred to as
“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” and include provisions
that:





·  


Introduce
      a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition
      allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from
      unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen
      extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and
      shale formations.








·  


Report
      oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior
      12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each
      month, rather than year-end pricing. This should maximize the
      comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate the
      distortion of the estimates that arises when using a single pricing
      date.








·  


Permit
      companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary
      basis. Current rules limit disclosure to only proved
    reserves.








·  


Update
      and revise reserve definitions to reflect changes in the oil and gas
      industry and new technologies. New updated definitions include “by
      geographic area” and “reasonable
certainty.”








·  


Permit
      the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those
      technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable
      conclusions about reserves volumes.








·  


Require
      additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical
      person who oversees the Partnership’s overall reserve estimation process.
      Additionally, disclosures are required related to internal controls over
      reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and
      qualifications of a Partnership’s reserves preparer or auditor based on
      Society of Petroleum Engineers
criteria.




We will
begin complying with the disclosure requirements in its annual report on Form
10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. The new rules may not be applied to
disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the
revised disclosures are required. We are currently in the process of evaluating
the new requirements.

ITEM
4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The
Partnership maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the MGP’s management, including the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, the MGP’s management recognized that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the
MGP’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Under the
supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the MGP
has carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Partnership’s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that the Partnership’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level at September 30,
2009.

There
have been no changes in the Partnership’s internal control over financial
reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.
