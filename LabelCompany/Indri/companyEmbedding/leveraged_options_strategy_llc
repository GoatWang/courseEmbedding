The Options Strategies » Fig Leaf


Fig Leaf
AKA Leveraged Covered Call; LEAPS Diagonal Spread




NOTE: The profit and loss lines are not straight. That’s because the LEAPS call is still open when the shorter-term call expires. Straight lines and hard angles usually indicate that all options in the strategy have the same expiration date.

The Strategy
Buying the LEAPS call gives you the right to buy the stock at strike A. Selling the call at strike B obligates you to sell the stock at that strike price if you’re assigned.
This strategy acts like a covered call but uses the LEAPS call as a surrogate for owning the stock. Though the two plays are similar, managing options with two different expiration dates makes a leveraged covered call a little trickier to run than a regular covered call.
The goal here is to purchase a LEAPS call that will see price changes similar to the stock. So look for a call with a delta of .80 or more. As a starting point, when searching for an appropriate delta, check options that are at least 20% in-the-money. But for a particularly volatile stock, you may need to go deeper in-the-money to find the delta you’re looking for.
Some investors favor this strategy over a covered call because you don’t have to put up all the capital to buy the stock. That means the premium you receive for selling the call will represent a higher percentage of your initial investment than if you bought the stock outright. In other words, the potential return is leveraged.
Of course, there are additional risks to keep in mind as well: LEAPS, unlike stock, eventually expire. And when they do, it’s possible that you could lose the entire value of your initial investment.
Unlike a covered call (where you typically wouldn’t mind being assigned on the short option), when running a fig leaf you don’t want to be assigned on the short call because you don’t actually own the stock yet. You only own the right to buy the stock at strike A.
You wouldn’t want to exercise the long LEAPS call to buy the stock because of all the time value you’d give up. Instead, you hope your short call will expire out-of-the-money so you can sell another, and then another, and then another until the long LEAPS call expires.
NOTE: If you are going to run this strategy, we’re going to make it mandatory for you to read the sections How We Roll and What Is Early Exercise and Why Does It Happen?


Options Guy's Tips
 Some investors choose to run this strategy on an expensive stock that they would like to trade, but don’t want to spend the capital to buy at least 100 shares.
If the stock price exceeds the strike price of the short option before expiration, you might want to consider closing out the entire position. If the strategy was implemented correctly, you should see a profit in such a case.
If you do get assigned on the short call, don’t make the mistake of exercising the LEAPS call. Sell the LEAPS call on the open market so you’ll capture the time value (if there’s any remaining) along with the intrinsic value. Simultaneously buy the stock to cover your newly created short stock position. This is a situation when it pays to have a broker who really understands options. So give us a call at TradeKing and we’ll help you through the process.




The Setup

Buy an in-the-money LEAPS call, strike price A
Sell an out-of-the-money short-term call, strike price B
Generally, the stock price will be closer to strike B than strike A

NOTE: Typically, the LEAPS call will be one to two years from expiration, and the short-term call will be 30 to 45 days from expiration.


Who Should Run It
Veterans and higher


When to Run It
 You’re mildly bullish


Break-even at Expiration
It is possible to approximate break-even points, but there are too many variables to give an exact formula.
Because there are two expiration dates for the options in a fig leaf, a pricing model must be used to “guesstimate” what the value of the back-month call will be when the front-month call expires. TradeKing’s Profit + Loss Calculator can help you in this regard. But keep in mind, the Profit + Loss Calculator assumes that all other variables, such as implied volatility, interest rates, etc., remain constant over the life of the trade — and they may not behave that way in reality.


The Sweet Spot
You want the stock to remain as close to the strike price of the short option as possible at expiration, without going above it.


Maximum Potential Profit
Potential profit is limited to the premium received for sale of the front-month call plus the performance of the LEAPS call.
NOTE: You can’t precisely calculate potential profit at initiation of this strategy, because it depends on how the LEAPS call performs and the premium received for the sale of additional short-term calls (if any) at later dates.


Maximum Potential Loss
Potential risk is limited to the debit paid to establish the strategy.
NOTE: You can’t precisely calculate your risk at initiation of this strategy, because it depends on how the LEAPS call performs and the premium received for the sale of additional short-term calls (if any) at later dates.


TradeKing Margin Requirement
After the trade is paid for, no additional margin is required.


As Time Goes By
Time decay is your friend, because the front-month option(s) you sell will lose their value faster than the back-month long LEAPS call.


Implied Volatility
After the strategy is established, the effect of implied volatility is somewhat neutral. Although it will increase the value of the call you sold (bad) it will also increase the value of the LEAPS call you bought (good).


About the Name
 Although this strategy has been run for quite some time, we at TradeKing have never heard an “official” name for it before. So we decided to give it one.
Special thanks to Weird Uncle Jesse from the TradeKing Trader Network for suggesting “fig leaf” (implying you’re kind of covered).
Props also go to TheMechanic and MLTrader for simultaneously suggesting “leveraged covered call” (which is a technically appropriate title).

                Leveraged Investment Showdown            


    By Tristan Yates 






Share















































Leveraged investing is a technique that seeks higher investment profits by using borrowed money. These profits come from the difference between the investment returns on the borrowed capital and the cost of the associated interest. Leveraged investing exposes an investor to higher risk. 
Where does the borrowed capital come from? From any source potentially, but in this article, we'll compare three common sources: a brokerage margin loan, a futures product (such as an index of single stock future) and a LEAP call option. These forms of capital are available to virtually any investor who has a brokerage account. Understanding the alternatives is the first step to building the right leveraged investment, so read on to learn more about how to determine what kind of leverage to use in your portfolio.
Margin LoansMargin loans use the equity in an investor's account as collateral. They are provided by brokers and are heavily regulated by the Federal Reserve and other agencies, as the availability of easy investment credit was one of the factors that contributed to the 1929 stock market crash.
SEE: Margin Trading
CostsInterest rates on margin loans are comparatively high and are usually tiered. For example, a large online broker may charge 7.24% on margin balances above $1 million, but 10.24% on balances below $50,000. Some online brokerages provide a less expensive margin and use it as a selling point.
AdvantagesThe advantage of margin loans is that they are easy to use, and the capital can be used to purchase virtually any investment. For example, an investor with 100 shares of Coca Cola could borrow against those shares and use the proceeds to buy put options on another security. Dividends from the Coca Cola shares could then be used to help pay the margin interest.
DisadvantagesAn investor who uses margin can face significant financial risk. If the equity in the account falls below a predetermined level, the broker will ask the investor to contribute additional capital or liquidate the investment position. 
SEE: What does it mean when the shares in my account have been liquidated?
The initial margin and maintenance margin serve as a cap on the amount that can be borrowed. A 50% initial maintenance margin requirement results in a maximum initial leverage ratio of 2 to 1, or $2 of assets for every $1 of equity. Of course, an investor that consistently uses the maximum margin available faces an increased risk of margin call in a market decline.
The minimums for both the initial and maintenance margin are set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, some brokers do provide customers with a way to bypass these minimums by providing certain accounts with portfolio margin. In these accounts, margin is based on the largest potential loss of the portfolio, as calculated by the underlying prices and volatilities. This may result in lower margin requirements, especially if hedging is used. 
SEE: A Beginner's Guide To Hedging
Stock and Index FuturesA futures contract is a financial instrument used to purchase a specific investment for a certain price at a later date. Financing costs are included in the price of the future, which makes the transaction equivalent to a short-term loan. 
SEE: Futures Fundamentals 
Futures are often associated with currencies, commodities and interest rates, rather than equities. However, in 2005, more than four billion of the almost 10 billion futures contracts traded that year were contracts on equity indexes.
CostsAlthough these products have a reputation for being beyond the reach of the typical retail investor, companies are moving quickly to expand access. More online brokerages now provide access to futures, and less initial capital is now required to trade them. For example, an E-mini S&P contract can be purchased for less than $4,000.
Investment selection is also limited but growing. Futures contracts can be purchased on well-known indexes, such as the S&P 500 or Russell 2000, on some exchange traded funds such as DIA (DJIA tracker) and now on more than 400 individual stocks. Futures contracts on stocks are known as single-stock futures (SSF). 
SEE: Surveying Single Stock Futures
AdvantagesFutures contracts are a favorite with traders because of their relatively low bid-ask spreads and the high amount of leverage provided by the contract. Interests costs are also much lower than margin rates; they are calculated as the broker call rate minus the dividend yield paid by the underlying securities. 
Every futures contract has a settlement date upon which the contract expires, but these dates are relatively meaningless, as most contracts are either sold or rolled forward to a future date.
Investors are required to maintain a cash position in order to purchase a future. This is often referred to as margin, but is actually a performance bond. This performance bond is equal to some percentage of the underlying, typically 5% for broad indexes and up to 20% for single stock futures. This provides leverage from 5 to1, to 20 to 1.
DisadvantagesIf the price of the underlying security declines, the investor will have to put up more cash to maintain his or her position. This is similar in practice to a margin call. This can make futures very risky. To prevent catastrophic losses, futures are often hedged with options.
Stock and ETF OptionsOptions provide a buyer with the right to buy or sell shares of a security for a specific price. Each option has a strike price and expiration date. Call options, or options to buy, have a built-in financing cost similar to futures. However, option pricing is primarily driven by seller risk, which is related to the volatility of the underlying investment. 
SEE: Options Basics 
AdvantagesOptions play an important role in the market as hedging tools. The potential downside risk in a futures contract is very large, often many times the initial investment. Using options can limit this risk, at the expense of some of the potential appreciation.
DisadvantagesOptions are available for most large stocks and many popular ETFs. Index options are more specialized, and are not available at most brokers. There may be dozens or even hundreds of options available for a specific security, and selecting the appropriate one can be difficult.
Part of the challenge is the tradeoff between the initial premium, the leverage provided and the rate of time decay. At-the-money and out-of-the-money call options with closer expiration dates have the highest amount of leverage, but can lose value rapidly as time passes. The relative complexity of this can be discouraging for new investors. 
SEE: The Importance Of Time Value In Options Trading
Options expire, but can be rolled over to new expiration dates by selling the existing option and purchasing a new one. This can be costly, depending on the bid-ask spreads of the two options. It also results in the investor trading a higher delta option for a lower delta option. 
SEE: Using Options Instead of Equity
The Bottom LineAlthough futures products are still not available to many retail investors and futures contracts are not available on all products, it's very likely that access to these products will continue to increase. Futures provide investors with higher leverage at lower interest rates than margin loans, resulting in greater capital efficiency and higher profit potential.
However, some brokers have taken steps to make margin loans more competitive with futures products. These brokers are charging lower interest rates and are either lowering interest rates to the SEC minimums or introducing portfolio margin to bypass them altogether. Margin loans also allow a much broader selection of investments than futures.
Both margin loans and futures contracts leave investors exposed to considerable downside risk. Declines in the underlying security can lead to large percentage losses and may require the investor to immediately provide additional funds or risk being sold out of their position at a loss.
Call options combine the leverage and interest rates of futures with hedging in order to limit downside risk. Hedging can be costly, but can lead to higher overall returns, as it allows an investor to invest more capital rather than holding a reserve for catastrophic losses.
There are many tools available to leveraged investors and the selection is growing. As always, the challenge is knowing when and how to use each one.

Investing In Leveraged ETFs - Theory And Practice | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Investing In Leveraged ETFs - Theory And PracticeMay  5, 2015 11:48 AM ET|| Includes: DUST, ERX, ERY, FAS, FAZ, GDX, NUGT, SPXL, SPXS, TNA, TZAby: Jonathan KinlayJonathan Kinlay Hedge fund manager, long/short equity, ETF investing, portfolio strategyQuantitative Research and TradingSummaryLeveraged ETFs suffer from decay, or "beta slippage." Researchers have attempted to exploit this effect by shorting pairs of long and inverse leveraged ETFs.The results of these strategies look good if you assume continuous compounding, but are often poor when less frequent compounding is assumed.In reality, the trading losses incurred in rebalancing the portfolio, which requires you to sell low and buy high, overwhelm any benefit from decay, making the strategies unprofitable in practice.A short levered ETF strategy has similar characteristics to a short straddle option position, with positive Theta and negative Gamma, and will experience periodic, large drawdowns.It is possible to develop leveraged ETF strategies producing high returns and Sharpe ratios with relative value techniques commonly used in option trading strategies.Decay in Leveraged ETFs
Leveraged ETFs continue to be much discussed on Seeking Alpha.
One aspect in particular that has caught analysts' attention is the decay, or "beta slippage" that leveraged ETFs tend to suffer from.
Seeking Alpha contributor Fred Picard in a 2013 article ("What You Need To Know About The Decay Of Leveraged ETFs") described the effect using the following hypothetical example:

To understand what is beta-slippage, imagine a very volatile asset that goes up 25% one day and down 20% the day after. A perfect double leveraged ETF goes up 50% the first day and down 40% the second day. On the close of the second day, the underlying asset is back to its initial price:
(1 + 0.25) x (1 - 0.2) = 1
And the perfect leveraged ETF?
(1 + 0.5) x (1 - 0.4) = 0.9
Nothing has changed for the underlying asset, and 10% of your money has disappeared. Beta-slippage is not a scam. It is the normal mathematical behavior of a leveraged and rebalanced portfolio. In case you manage a leveraged portfolio and rebalance it on a regular basis, you create your own beta-slippage. The previous example is simple, but beta-slippage is not simple. It cannot be calculated from statistical parameters. It depends on a specific sequence of gains and losses.


Fred goes on to make the point that is the crux of this article, as follows:
At this point, I'm sure that some smart readers have seen an opportunity: if we lose money on the long side, we make a profit on the short side, right?
Shorting Leveraged ETFs
Taking his cue from Fred's article, Seeking Alpha contributor Stanford Chemist ("Shorting Leveraged ETF Pairs: Easier Said Than Done") considers the outcome of shorting pairs of leveraged ETFs, including the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX), the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:NUGT) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:DUST).
His initial finding appears promising:

Therefore, investing $10,000 each into short positions of NUGT and DUST would have generated a profit of $9,830 for NUGT, and $3,900 for DUST, good for an average profit of 68.7% over 3 years, or 22.9% annualized.
At first sight, this appears to a nearly risk-free strategy; after all, you are shorting both the 3X leveraged bull and 3X leveraged bear funds, which should result in a market neutral position. Is there easy money to be made?


Source: Standford Chemist
Not so fast! Stanford Chemist applies the same strategy to another ETF pair, with a very different outcome:

"What if you had instead invested $10,000 each into short positions of the Direxion Russell 1000 Financials Bullish 3X ETF (NYSEARCA:FAS) and the Direxion Russell 1000 Financials Bearish 3X ETF (NYSEARCA:FAZ)?
The $10,000 short position in FAZ would have gained you $8,680. However, this would have been dwarfed by the $28,350 loss that you would have sustained in shorting FAS. In total, you would be down $19,670, which translates into a loss of 196.7% over three years, or 65.6% annualized.


No free lunch there.
The Rebalancing Issue
Stanford Chemist puts his finger on one of the key issues: rebalancing. He explains as follows:
So what happened to the FAS-FAZ pair? Essentially, what transpired was that as the underlying asset XLF increased in value, the two short positions became unbalanced. The losing side (short FAS) ballooned in size, making further losses more severe. On the other hand, the winning side (short FAZ) shrunk, muting the effect of further gains.
To counteract this effect, the portfolio needs to be rebalanced. Stanford Chemist looks at the implications of rebalancing a short NUGT-DUST portfolio whenever the market value of either ETF deviates by more than N% from its average value, where he considers N% in the range from 10% to 100%, in increments of 10%.
While the annual portfolio return was positive in all but one of these scenarios, there was very considerable variation in the outcomes, with several of the rebalanced portfolios suffering very large drawdowns of as much as 75%:

The author concludes:
The results of the backtest showed that profiting from this strategy is easier said than done. The total return performances of the strategy over the past three years was highly dependent on the rebalancing thresholds chosen. Unfortunately, there was also no clear correlation between the rebalancing period used and the total return performance. Moreover, the total return profiles showed that large drawdowns do occur, meaning that despite being ostensibly "market neutral", this strategy still bears a significant amount of risk.
Leveraged ETF Pairs - Four Case Studies
Let's press pause here and review a little financial theory. As you recall, it is possible to express a rate of return in many different ways, depending on how interest is compounded. The most typical case is daily compounding:

R = (Pt - Pt-1) / Pt
Where Pt is the price on day t, and Pt-1 is the price on day t-1, one day prior.
Another commonly used alternative is continuous compounding, also sometimes called log-returns:
R = Ln(Pt) - Ln(Pt-1)
Where Ln(Pt) is the natural log of the price on day t, Pt
When a writer refers to a rate of return, he should make clear what compounding basis the return rate is quoted on, whether continuous, daily, monthly or some other frequency. Usually, however, the compounding basis is clear from the context. Besides, it often doesn't make a large difference anyway. But with leveraged ETFs, even microscopic differences can produce substantially different outcomes.
I will illustrate the effect of compounding by reference to examples of portfolios comprising short positions in the following representative pairs of leveraged ETFs:

Direxion Daily Energy Bull 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:ERX)
Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:ERY)
Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF
Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X ETF
Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXL)
Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS)
Direxion Daily Small Cap Bull 3X ETF (NYSEARCA:TNA)
Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X ETF (NYSEARCA:TZA)

The findings in relation to these pairs are mirrored by results for other leveraged ETF pairs.
First, let's look the returns in the ETF portfolios measured using continuous compounding.

Source: Yahoo! Finance
The portfolio returns look very impressive, with CAGRs ranging from around 20% for the short TNA-TZA pair, to over 124% for the short NUGT-DUST pair. Sharpe ratios, too, appear abnormally large, ranging from 4.5 for the ERX-ERY short pair to 8.4 for NUGT-DUST.

Now let's look at the performance of the same portfolios measured using daily compounding.

Source: Yahoo! Finance
It's an altogether different picture. None of the portfolios demonstrate an attract performance record and indeed in two cases the CAGR is negative.
What's going on?
Stock Loan Costs
Before providing the explanation, let's just get one important detail out of the way. Since you are shorting both legs of the ETF pairs, you will be faced with paying stock borrow costs. Borrow costs for leveraged ETFs can be substantial and depending on market conditions amount to as much as 10% per annum, or more.
In computing the portfolio returns in both the continuous and daily compounding scenarios I have deducted annual stock borrow costs based on recent average quotes from Interactive Brokers, as follows:

ERX-ERY: 14%
NUGT-DUST: 16%
SXPL-SPXS: 8%
TNA-TZA: 8%

It's All About Compounding and Rebalancing
The implicit assumption in the computation of the daily compounded returns shown above is that you are rebalancing the portfolios each day. That is to say, it is assumed that at the end of each day you buy or sell sufficient quantities of shares of each ETF to maintain an equal $ value in both legs.
In the case of continuously compounded returns the assumption you are making is that you maintain an equal $ value in both legs of the portfolio at every instant. Clearly that is impossible.
Ok, so if the results from low frequency rebalancing are poor, while the results for instantaneous rebalancing are excellent, it is surely just a question of rebalancing the portfolio as frequently as is practically possible. While we may not be able to achieve the ideal result from continuous rebalancing, the results we can achieve in practice will reflect how close we can come to that ideal, right?

Unfortunately, not.
Because, while we have accounted for stock borrow costs, what we have ignored in the analysis so far are transaction costs.
Transaction Costs
With daily rebalancing transaction costs are unlikely to be a critical factor - one might execute a single trade towards the end of the trading session. But in the continuous case, it's a different matter altogether.
Let's use the SPXL-SPXS pair as an illustration. When the S&P 500 index declines, the value of the SPXL ETF will fall, while the value of the SPXS ETF will rise. In order to maintain the same $ value in both legs you will need to sell more shares in SPXL and buy back some shares in SPXS. If the market trades up, SPXL will increase in value, while the price of SPXS will fall, requiring you to buy back some SPXL shares and sell more SPXS.
In other words, to rebalance the portfolio you will always be trying to sell the ETF that has declined in price, while attempting to buy the inverse ETF that has appreciated. It is often very difficult to execute a sale in a declining stock at the offer price, or buy an advancing stock at the inside bid. To be sure of completing the required rebalancing of the portfolio, you are going to have to buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price, paying the bid-offer spread each time.
Spreads in leveraged ETF products tend to be large, often several pennies. The cumulative effect of repeatedly paying the bid-ask spread, while taking trading losses on shares sold at the low or bought at the high, will be sufficient to overwhelm the return you might otherwise hope to make from the ETF decay.
And that's assuming the best case scenario that shares are always available to short. Often they may not be: so that, if the market trades down and you need to sell more SPXL, there may be none available and you will be unable to rebalance your portfolio, even if you were willing to pay the additional stock loan costs and bid-ask spread.
A Lose-Lose Proposition
So, in summary: if you rebalance infrequently you will avoid excessive transaction costs; but the $ imbalance that accrues over the course of a trading day will introduce a market bias in the portfolio. That can hurt portfolio returns very badly if you get caught on the wrong side of a major market move. The results from daily rebalancing for the illustrative pairs shown above indicate that this is likely to happen all too often.

On the other hand, if you try to maintain market neutrality in the portfolio by rebalancing at high frequency, the returns you earn from decay will be eaten up by transaction costs and trading losses, as you continuously sell low and buy high, paying the bid-ask spread each time.
Either way, you lose.
Ok, what about if you reverse the polarity of the portfolio, going long both legs? Won't that avoid the very high stock borrow costs and put you in a better position as regards the transaction costs involved in rebalancing?
Yes, it will. Because, you will be selling when the market trades up and buying when it falls, making it much easier to avoid paying the bid-ask spread. You will also tend to make short term trading profits by selling high and buying low. Unfortunately, you may not be surprised to learn, these advantages are outweighed by the cost of the decay incurred in both legs of the long ETF portfolio.
In other words: you can expect to lose if you are short; and lose if you are long!
An Analogy from Option Theory
To anyone with a little knowledge of basic option theory, what I have been describing should sound like familiar territory.
Being short the ETF pair is like being short an option (actually a pair of call and put options, called a straddle). You earn decay, or Theta, for those familiar with the jargon, by earning the premium on the options you have sold; but at the risk of being short Gamma - which measures your exposure to a major market move.

Source: Interactive Brokers
You can hedge out the portfolio's Gamma exposure by trading the underlying securities - the ETF pair in this case - and when you do that you find yourself always having to sell at the low and buy at the high. If the options are fairly priced, the option decay is enough, but not more, to compensate for the hedging cost involved in continuously trading the underlying.

Conversely, being long the ETF pair is like being long a straddle on the underling pair. You now have positive Gamma exposure, so your portfolio will make money from a major market move in either direction. However, the value of the straddle, initially the premium you paid, decays over time at a rate Theta (also known as the "bleed").

Source: Interactive Brokers
You can offset the bleed by performing what is known as Gamma trading. When the market trades up your portfolio delta becomes positive, i.e. an excess $ value in the long ETF leg, enabling you to rebalance your position by selling excess deltas at the high. Conversely, when the market trades down, your portfolio delta becomes negative and you rebalance by buying the underlying at the current, reduced price. In other words, you sell at the high and buy at the low, typically making money each time. If the straddle is fairly priced, the profits you make from Gamma trading will be sufficient to offset the bleed, but not more.
Typically, the payoff from being short options - being short the ETF pair - will show consistent returns for sustained periods, punctuated by very large losses when the market makes a significant move in either direction.
Conversely, if you are long options - long the ETF pair - you will lose money most of the time due to decay and occasionally make a very large profit.
In an efficient market in which securities are fairly priced, neither long nor short option strategy can be expected to dominate the other in the long run. In fact, transaction costs will tend to produce an adverse outcome in either case! As with most things in life, the house is the player most likely to win.
Developing a Leveraged ETF Strategy that Works

Investors shouldn't be surprised that it is hard to make money simply by shorting leveraged ETF pairs, just as it is hard to make money by selling options, without risking blowing up your account.
And yet, many traders do trade options and often manage to make substantial profits. In some cases traders are simply selling options, hoping to earn substantial option premiums without taking too great a hit when the market explodes. They may get away with it for many years, before blowing up. Indeed, that has been the case since 2009. But who would want to be an option seller here, with the market at an all-time high? It's simply far too risky.
The best option traders make money by trading both the long and the short side. Sure, they might lean in one direction or the other, depending on their overall market view and the opportunities they find. But they are always hedged, to some degree. In essence what many option traders seek to do is what is known as relative value trading - selling options they regard as expensive, while hedging with options they see as being underpriced. Put another way, relative value traders try to buy cheap Gamma and sell expensive Theta.
This is how one can thread the needle in leveraged ETF strategies. You can't hope to make money simply by being long or short all the time - you need to create a long/short ETF portfolio in which the decay in the ETFs you are short is greater than in the ETFs you are long. Such a strategy is, necessarily, tactical: your portfolio holdings and net exposure will likely change from long to short, or vice versa, as market conditions shift. There will be times when you will use leverage to increase your market exposure and occasions when you want to reduce it, even to the point of exiting the market altogether.
If that sounds rather complicated, I'm afraid it is. I have been developing and trading arbitrage strategies of this kind since the early 2000s, often using sophisticated option pricing models. In 2012 I began trading a volatility strategy in ETFs, using a variety of volatility ETF products, in combination with equity and volatility index futures.

I have reproduced the results from that strategy below, to give some indication of what is achievable in the ETF space using relative value arbitrage techniques.

Conclusion
There are no free lunches in the market. The apparent high performance of strategies that engage systematically in shorting leveraged ETFs is an illusion, based on a failure to quantify the full costs of portfolio rebalancing.
The payoff from a short leveraged ETF pair strategy will be comparable to that of a short straddle position, with positive decay (Theta) and negative Gamma (exposure to market moves). Such a strategy will produce positive returns most of the time, punctuated by very large drawdowns.
The short Gamma exposure can be mitigated by continuously rebalancing the portfolio to maintain dollar neutrality. However, this will entail repeatedly buying ETFs as they trade up and selling them as they decline in value. The transaction costs and trading losses involved in continually buying high and selling low will eat up most, if not all, of the value of the decay in the ETF legs.
A better approach to trading ETFs is relative value arbitrage, in which ETFs with high decay rates are sold and hedged by purchases of ETFs with relatively low rates of decay.
An example given of how this approach has been applied successfully in volatility ETFs since 2012.

The covered call is perhaps the most widely known options strategy. It involves selling a call option on a stock you already own. There is a variation of the covered call strategy, known as the leveraged covered call, that allows you to simulate a covered call position while not having to put up as much capital.
Interested in knowing more? First, let’s review how the basic covered call works, so you can fully understand this slightly more advanced version of the covered call strategy.

            The covered call
        
The purpose of a covered call strategy is to generate income on a stock you own. It involves owning a stock and selling call options on the same stock. You would consider executing a covered call if you had a neutral to slightly bearish outlook on a stock.
For instance, suppose you owned XYZ stock and believe that the stock might trade flat or weaken slightly over a certain period of time. You might decide that you do not want to sell the stock (perhaps because you believe it may increase in price in the long run), and would like to generate some income on it during the period of time that you think it will not go up in price.
If you sold one call option on the stock you own, you would effectively be agreeing to sell 100 shares of the stock at an agreed-upon price, known as the strike price, if the option is assigned. You would earn up-front income for selling the option. This is a covered call.

In doing so, you would forgo potential profits on the stock if the stock price rose above the strike price of the sold option and the calls were exercised. In this event, you would have to sell the stock at the strike price, so you would need to be comfortable with that trade-off.

            The leveraged covered call
        





This less well known variation of the traditional covered call strategy provides an alternative if you would like to put up less capital at the outset of the trade. The covered call and leveraged covered call strategies share the same outlook, which is neutral/bearish over the short term and bullish over the longer term.
To construct the leveraged covered call, you would sell a shorter-term call (usually an out-of-the-money call). The key difference between a covered call and a leveraged covered call is that instead of owning the underlying stock upon which you sold the call, you would buy a long, deep in-the-money “LEAP.” Short for long-term equity anticipation securities, LEAPs are options with a longer time until expiration, typically nine months to a year.
The assumption here is that the purchase of the LEAP should cost less than purchasing the same amount of shares of the underlying stock, while simulating the profit/loss potential of the covered call position.

            Greeks and the leveraged covered call

There are a few things you can do to potentially improve the probability of a successful leveraged covered call trade.
As with any other options strategy, greeks can be invaluable for making the most of your trade. One greek in particular, delta, is especially useful. Delta is the sensitivity of an options price to the change in the price of the underlying asset.
“The strike price of the purchased LEAP should have a high delta so that there will be a high correlation between the stock price movement and the option price movement,” says Colin Songer, a strategy desk representative with Fidelity. This will help simulate the profit/loss diagram of the covered call strategy (see the chart right).
“One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the higher the delta, the more expensive the LEAP, all other factors being the same,” Songer notes.

            Capital requirements, assignment risk, volatility
        
The maximum risk of both strategies is similar: The stock could go to zero. In order to choose the appropriate strategy for the covered call or leveraged covered call, you should consider several factors.
The primary advantage of the leveraged covered call is that the purchased LEAP will cost less than buying the same number of shares covered by the option. This leads to a potentially higher return on investment and lower maximum loss.
However, the sold call is at risk of assignment (i.e., you would be short the shares). Depending on whether the option was assigned prior to the ex-dividend date, this could result in a position where, unlike the covered call strategy, you would need to pay the dividend. Consequently, this could have a negative effect on the profitability of this strategy.





Unlike the covered call strategy, the purchase of a LEAP means you are long vega. Vega is a measure of an option price’s sensitivity for a given change in implied volatility. An increase in the implied volatility (i.e., the expected volatility) of an option will increase the value of a call or put option, and falling implied volatility decreases the value of either type of option. Simply put, an increase in implied volatility (IV) is good for this strategy because it would increase the value of the purchased call LEAP.
However, if IV were to decrease, so would the value of the options. That would hurt the strategy. With the LEAP being deep in the money, vega exposure would be less than at-the-money options, but would still be high due to the longer expiration.

            A few leveraged covered call tips
        
You may want to consider selling a short-term call that is nearly at the money to take advantage of the acceleration of another greek, theta, which measures the impact of the time decay that typically happens prior to expiration.
This strategy may provide an opportunity to adjust strike prices as the price of the underlying security moves. This allows for an increase in the frequency of selling calls against the same LEAP. “If you are a little more bullish, you can use out-of-the-money call options to allow for a greater balance between potential stock appreciation and premium income,” Songer suggests. “Out-of-the-money options would be used for a more bullish outlook, and they allow for a higher return on investment.”
Finally, if the security moves close to the strike price of the short call, it may be time to reevaluate the strategy and either roll the short option up or out to the next month, buy back the short call and let the long option run, or close out the strategy altogether. If the short call goes in the money and your outlook changes to bearish, you can take on the assignment.

Supporting documentation for any claims, if appropriate, will be furnished upon request.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund, exchange-traded fund, or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


This information is intended to be educational and is not tailored to the investment needs of any specific investor.



Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.


Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



          Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Prior to trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options, and call 800-343-3548 to be approved for options trading.  Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.
	
    

          There are additional costs associated with option strategies that call for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads, straddles, and collars, as compared to a single option trade.
	
    

          Sector investing can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry.
	
    

          Diversification cannot ensure a profit or protect against loss.
	
    

          Fidelity does not provide legal or tax advice and the information provided above is general in nature and should not be considered legal or tax advice. Consult with an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.

Meet Wendy Kirkland
 
How  did an award-winning artist and sculptor who owned an eclectic gift shop in  Historic Biltmore Village, end up an option guru?  Let’s see…
In  2004 a freak flood destroyed the retail business Wendy and her husband had  poured every bit of their time and money into for more than 25 years. 
Since  they had no flood insurance, they lost everything… and were in real trouble.  Fortunately, a friend introduced Wendy to options trading.
Desperate  to save her family from financial ruin, Wendy started reading books, watching  financial news, and taking courses… struggling with the same sort of ups and  downs as most new traders.
Then  one day she stumbled upon a miraculous discovery.  By combining two common indicators into one,  she created a hybrid indicator that’s nearly 100% infallible!
Practically  overnight Wendy was making more money trading than she and Jack had ever made  in their store!
Inspired to help other women enjoy the financial security  she had found, Wendy started giving onIine classes. And in 2009 she  co-authored a book entitled: “Option Trading In Your Spare Time—A Guide to  Financial Independence for Women”.
“I feel I was  given a second chance,” Wendy said. “So I felt I owed it to society to give  back, and help others.  And go make a  difference”
And that’s exactly what she’s done… in spades!
Get this, undeterred by the title and pretty pink cover of her first  book, even more men than women ended up buying it!   And  that led to 6 more books, trading courses, newsletters, and advisory services.
Written about in Money Magazine, Small Business Opportunities Magazine,  and Investor’s Business Daily… Wendy is quoted as saying :  “I LOVE  that my books have helped so many people achieve financial independence through  trading, just like I had.”
Grandma’s  Simple Secret for Extra Income is Wendy’s gift to you... ENJOY!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
