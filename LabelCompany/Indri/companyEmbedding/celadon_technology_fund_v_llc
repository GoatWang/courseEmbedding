B-298533, Celadon Laboratories, Inc., November 1, 2006




Decision


Matter of: Celadon Laboratories, Inc.

File: B-298533

Date: November 1,
2006


Lawrence
A. Kessner, Esq., for the protester.
Douglas
Kornreich, Esq., Department of Health and Human Services, for the agency.
Katherine
I. Riback, Esq., and James A. Spangenberg, Esq., Office of the General Counsel,
GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.

DIGEST

Agency failed to determine whether
the evaluators of the protester�s proposal under a Small Business Innovation
Research program solicitation had a conflict of interest, where the evaluators were
employed by firms that promote a type of technology that assertedly is directly
challenged by the type of technology offered in the protester�s proposal. 

DECISION


Celadon Laboratories, Inc.
protests the decision of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) not
to fund its phase I proposal under the Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) program solicitation No. PHS 2006-1.
Celadon asserts that the agency failed to reasonably consider conflicts
of interest that it contends likely impaired the objectivity of the four
members of the Special Emphasis Panel (SEP), which evaluated its proposal. 

We sustain the protest.

The SBIR program is conducted pursuant to the Small
Business Innovation Development Act, 15 U.S.C. sect. 638 (2000), which requires
certain federal agencies to reserve a portion of their research and development
funds for awards to small businesses.
Firms first apply for a 6-month phase I award to test the scientific,
technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of a certain concept. If phase I is successful, the firm may be
invited to apply for a phase II award to further develop the concept. After the completion of phase II, firms are
expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR government
sources to develop the concept into a product for sale in the private sector
and/or military markets. See
Small Business Administration�s SBIR Website, http://www.sba.gov/sbir/. 

To commence the program, the agency issues an SBIR solicitation
that sets forth research and development topics and subtopics that emphasize
the need for proposals with advanced concepts to meet specific agency requirements,
which may be general or narrow in scope, depending on the needs of the
agency. The object of this phase I
procurement is to obtain and evaluate small business proposals under stated
evaluation criteria to determine which small businesses should receive phase I
contracts. During phase I, the agency
will determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the
proposed effort and the quality of performance of the small business concern
with a relatively small agency investment before consideration of further
federal support in phase II. SBIR
Program Policy Directive para. 4(a). 

On August 4, 2005,
HHS issued this solicitation which identified a number of research topics for
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease
Control. One of the topics included in
the solicitation was Topic 216, Development of Inhibitory Reagents for the
Study of Protein Function, which was a research topic of interest requested by
the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of NIH. The purpose of this topic was to solicit
proposals from small business concerns to encourage the development and
commercialization of new technology for the generation of small molecules and
novel mechanisms to modulate protein function within a cancer cell. Solicitation at 33.

Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation were
to be evaluated by an SEP. The SEP is an
independent peer review panel, which evaluates the proposals, determines which
small business concerns should receive phase I contracts and makes specific
recommendations related to the scope, direction and/or conduct of the proposed
research. Solicitation at 18. 

In this instance, the SEP, assembled by the NCI, consisted
of three members from private industry and one from academia. According to the agency, in preparation for
their work on the SEP, prospective members were mailed a copy of NIH�s rules,
including those relating to conflicts of interest. Prior to their first meeting, the four members
provided to HHS a signed NIH Pre‑Review Certification Form, in which each
member certified that he/she did not have a conflict of interest with the firms
that had submitted proposals for review, including Celadon. Additionally, according to the agency, conflicts
of interest were addressed in the SEP orientation conference and at the
beginning of the first review meeting. 

On April 8, 2006,
the protester�s chief executive officer expressed concern to the agency about
the composition of the SEP, asserting that each of its members had a real
conflict of interest that would likely bias their review of Celadon�s proposal.[1] Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, Letter from
Celadon to NCI (April 8, 2006). In this letter, and in an April 19
letter, Celadon identified with specificity why each of the SEP members had
what Celadon considered a real conflict of interest. Id.;
AR, Tab 10, Letter from Celadon to NCI (April
 19, 2006). Basically,
Celadon asserted that all four of the SEP members work for, or are associated
with, a segment of the industry, specifically vendors that rely on siRNA
technology, a technology that Celadon, without rebuttal, asserts was directly
competitive with the technology it offered in its proposal, specifically siLNA
technology. Celadon provided supporting
details for why it considered each of these evaluators to have a real conflict
of interest because of their employers� commitment to, and reliance on, siRNA
technology. AR, Tab 10, Letter from
Celadon to NCI (April 19, 2006).

By April 25, the SEP had completed its evaluation of
Celadon�s proposal and found it to be technically unacceptable. In response to the concerns that had been
expressed by Celadon, the agency took the following measures:
The Contracting Officer asked the Project Officer to review
the proposal and the minutes of the SEP and provide a recommendation as to
whether the minutes reflect an accurate assessment of the proposal. The Project Officer�s response concurred with
the assessment of the SEP and [he] felt the minutes accurately reflected both
the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal.
The Contracting Officer reviewed the conflict of interest
certifications, the minutes of the SEP and the recommendation of the Project Officer
and concluded that, in his opinion, there was no bias exhibited in the review
of the Celadon proposal.
Contracting Officer�s Statement at 2. 

On July 13, the agency informed Celadon that its proposal
would not be considered for award and on that same day, Celadon requested a
formal debriefing. The agency provided a
debriefing on July 14, and Celadon filed this protest on July 24.

The agency initially contends that Celadon�s protest was
untimely because it was aware of the composition of the SEP prior to the
rejection of its proposal and it did not file a protest within 10 days of
becoming aware of the composition of the SEP.


Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the
timely submission of protests. These
timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair
opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without
disrupting or delaying the procurement process.
Peacock, Myers & Adams, B-279327, Mar. 24, 1998, 98-1 CPD para. 94 at 3-4; Professional
Rehab. Consultants, Inc., B-275871, Feb. 28, 1997, 97-1 CPD para. 94 at 2. Under these rules, a protest such as
Celadon�s, based on other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation, must be
filed not later than 10 days after the protester knew or should have known of
the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.
4 C.F.R. sect. 21.2(a)(2) (2006). An
exception to this general rule is a protest that challenges �a procurement
conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is
requested and, when requested, is required.�
Id. In such cases, with respect to any protest
basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of
the debriefing, the protest must be filed not later than 10 days after the date
on which the debriefing is held. Id.


Here, the protest was filed within 10 days of the debriefing
Celadon received, even though it knew its protest bases sometime earlier. The above-mentioned exception to our
timeliness rules, however, applies only to procurements conducted on the basis
of �competitive proposals,� a term not defined by our Bid Protest Regulations,
nor by statute or regulation.[2] See
Systems Plus, Inc. v. United States, 
68 Fed. Cl. 206 (2005). We have
previously determined that the use of negotiated procedures in accordance with
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and as evidenced by the issuance
of a request for proposals, constitutes a procurement conducted on the basis of
competitive proposals. Professional
Rehab. Consultants, Inc., supra, at 2. Here, while this SBIR procurement was not
conducted under FAR Part 15 procedures, the solicitation requested �proposals�
to be judged under specified evaluation criteria.[3] 

We need not resolve whether this procurement was conducted
on the basis of competitive proposals within the meaning of our timeliness
rules because we find that this protest is appropriate for consideration under
the significant issue exception to our timeliness rules. 4 C.F.R. sect. 21.2(c). What constitutes a significant issue is to be
decided on a case-by-case basis. Pyxis
Corp., B-282469, B-282469.2, July
 15, 1999, 99‑2 CPD para. 18 at 4.
We generally regard a significant issue as one of widespread interest to
the procurement community and that has not been previously decided. Satilla
Rural Electric Membership Corp., B‑238187, May 7, 1990, 90-1 CPD para. 456 at 3. The issue here--the application of conflict
of interest regulations to peer review evaluators in SBIR procurements--is not
one that we have previously decided and is one that can be expected to arise in
future SBIR procurements. Accordingly,
we consider the issue raised to be a significant one that should be treated on
the merits. 

Celadon protests that the agency failed to reasonably consider
the real conflicts of interest of each of the members of the SEP that would
impair the SEP�s objectivity in evaluating its proposal. Celadon claims that all three of the SEP
members work for companies �whose economic lifeblood� is the development and
sale of proprietary siRNA technology, which would be directly competitive with
the technology proposed in Celadon�s proposal.
Protest at 3. While the fourth
panelist was an academic researcher, Celadon contends that his work is
supported by one of these companies involved with siRNA technology. 

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) sect. 3.101-1 provides as
follows:

Government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach
and, except as authorized by statute or regulation, with complete impartiality
and with preferential treatment for none.
Transactions relating to the expenditure of public funds require the
highest degree of public trust and an impeccable standard of conduct. The general rule is to avoid strictly any conflict
of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in Government-contractor
relationships.
NIH is required to have peer review evaluators of proposals
for research and development contracts.
48 C.F.R. sect. 315.305(a)(3)(ii)(F)
(2005). There are specific
regulations governing scientific peer review of research grant applications and
research and development contract projects, including �biomedical and
behavioral research and development contract project concepts and proposals for
contract projects administered by the National Institutes of Health,� such as
proposals in response to this SBIR program solicitation. 42 C.F.R. Part 52h. Among other things, this regulation defines
apparent and real conflicts of interest for peer review evaluators and generally prohibits evaluators
with such conflicts from evaluating proposals covered by 42 C.F.R. Part 52h.[4] 42 C.F.R. sections 52h.1,
52h.5. This regulation specifically contains
the following definition of a �real conflict of interest�: 
Real conflict of
interest means a reviewer or close relative or professional associate of
the reviewer has a financial or other interest in an application or proposal
that is known to the reviewer and is likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation
of that application or proposal as determined by the government official
managing the review (the Scientific Review Administrator, or equivalent), as
acknowledged by the reviewer, or as prescribed by this part. A reviewer shall have a real conflict of
interest if he/she or a close relative or professional associate of the
reviewer:
(1) Has received or could receive a direct financial benefit
of any amount deriving from an application or proposal under review;
(2) Apart from any direct financial benefit deriving from an
application or proposal under review, has received or could receive a financial
benefit from the applicant institution, offeror or principal investigator that
in the aggregate exceeds $10,000 per year; . . . 
(3) Has any other interest in the application or proposal
that is likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation of that application or
proposal. Regardless of the level of
financial involvement or other interest, if the reviewer feels unable to
provide objective advice, he/she must recuse him/herself from the review of the
application or proposal at issue. The
peer review system relies on the professionalism of each reviewer to identify
to the designated government official any real or apparent conflicts of
interest that are likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation of an application or
proposal.
42 C.F.R. sect. 52h.2(q).


Celadon contends that each of these evaluators had a �real
conflict of interest� under paragraph (3) above in that they each had an �interest
in the application or proposal that is likely to bias the reviewer�s evaluation
of that application or proposal,� given that each of the evaluators was
employed by a firm whose �economic lifeblood� was directly competitive with the technology
proposed in Celadon�s proposal. 
42 C.F.R. sect. 52h.2(q)(3).

The record shows that the agency�s investigation of
Celadon�s allegations consisted of verifying that each member of the SEP
certified that he/she had no conflict of interest with regard to Celadon, and reviewing
the evaluation record and finding no evidence of bias in the evaluation. While it is true that the NIH regulations
contemplate a self-assessment by evaluators as to whether they think they have
a real conflict of interest, the regulations do not contemplate that a self‑certification
by the evaluator is all that is ever needed to satisfy the requirement that he
or she does not have a real conflict of interest, particularly where, as here,
specific and colorable allegations of a real conflict of interest on the part
of the evaluators were brought to the attention of cognizant agency officials. Under the circumstances present here, NIH was
required to specifically determine whether these evaluators had real conflicts
of interest under the applicable regulations.
However, the record shows that NIH made no such determination.

While the agency contends that the conflicts identified by
the protester are too remote to be considered real conflicts of interest, it
has not explained why this is the case in light of the protester�s specific documented
allegations that each of the members of the SEP, by virtue of their employment
or financial relationship with a firm that promoted siRNA technology, would not
be able to objectively evaluate Celadon�s proposal that offered siLNA
technology.[5] We have recognized that an actual or apparent
conflict of interest may arise when an agency employee has both an official
role in the procurement process and a personal stake in the outcome. For example, we sustained a protest because
of a conflict of interest that invalidated the evaluation where, in the course
of a competitive sourcing study conducted pursuant to the procedures of Office
of Management and Budget Circular A-76, 14 of the 16 agency employees who
were responsible for evaluating private-sector proposals also held positions
that were subject to the study (and could be affected by the outcome of their
evaluation). DZS/Baker LLC; Morrison
Knudsen Corp., B-281224 et al., Jan. 12, 1999, 99-1 CPD para. 19 at 5. While we do not decide whether the evaluators
here had real conflicts of interest, the record shows that the agency failed in
its obligation to determine whether these individuals� employment caused them a
real conflict of interest that could bias their evaluation of Celadon�s
proposal as contemplated under its applicable regulation.[6]

The agency�s determination that there is no evidence of
actual bias on the part of the evaluators in the evaluation of Celadon�s
proposal does not address the concerns arising from a conflict of interest. The strict limitations on both actual and
apparent conflicts of interest reflect the reality that the potential harm
flowing from such situations is, by its nature, frequently not susceptible to
demonstrable proof of bias or prejudice.
Department of the Navy--Recon., B-286194.7, May 29, 2002, 2002 CPD para. 76 at 11. Thus, where the record establishes that a
conflict of interest exists on the part of the evaluators, to maintain the
integrity of the procurement process, we will presume that the protester was
prejudiced, unless the record establishes the absence of prejudice. The Jones/Hill Joint Venture, B-286194.4
et al., Dec. 5, 2001,
2001 CPD para. 194 at 14. Indeed, where
the majority of the evaluators have conflicts, as is alleged to be the case
here, we have consistently presumed prejudice in the evaluation. The Jones/Hill Joint Venture, supra;
DZS/Baker LLC; Morrison Knudsen Corp., supra.

We would ordinarily recommend that the agency consider
whether there is a conflict of interest on the part of the evaluators in
accordance with 42 C.F.R. sect. 52h and take appropriate corrective action if
a conflict of interest on the part of the evaluators was determined to
exist. However, here the agency has stated
that all the SBIR funds for the fiscal years have been allocated and it has no
funds for additional awards under the SBIR solicitation.[7] Under the circumstances, we recommend that it
reimburse Celadon its proposal preparation costs. We also recommend that the agency reimburse
Celadon for the costs of filing and pursuing its protest, including reasonable
attorney�s fees. Celadon�s certified
claim for costs, detailing the time spent and costs incurred, must be submitted
to the agency within 60 days of receiving this decision. 4 C.F.R. sect. 21.8(f)(1). 

The protest is sustained.

Gary L. Kepplinger
General Counsel 




[1]
During the course of this procurement, the protester had been informed by an
NCI official of the identity of the SEP members.


[2]
We note, however, that Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) sect. 6.401(b),
�Competitive Proposals,� begins with the reference, �See Part 15 for
procedures.� 


[3]
We note that the agency cited FAR Part 15 in offering Celadon a
debriefing. AR, Tab 14, Letter from
NCI to Celadon (July 14, 2006).


[4]
The regulation also provides that the Director may waive any requirements
relating to a �real conflict of interest,� if the Director determines that
there are no other practical means for securing appropriate expert advice on
the particular matter, and that the real conflict of interest is not so
substantial as to be likely to affect the integrity of the advice to be
provided by the reviewer. 42 C.F.R. sect.
52h.5(b)(4). There was no such waiver
here.


[5]
In support of this proposition the agency cites Grassetti v. Weinberger,
408 F.Supp. 142 (N.D. Cal.
1976). The plaintiff in that case argued
that the three members in the peer review panel had a conflict of interest in
that these individuals, or the institutions with which they were associated,
were recipients of NCI funded grants.
The court found the alleged conflicts were too remote, and granted the
defendant�s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the record failed
to show any violation of law in the denial of the plaintiff�s grant
application. 


[6]
We disagree with the agency�s characterization of Celadon�s protest as being
limited to a complaint about the �balance� of the SEP and thus not for
consideration by our Office. See University
Research Corp., B-253725.4, Oct. 26, 1993, 93-2 CPD para. 259 at 7 (GAO will
not generally review objections to the composition of a peer review panel
absent a showing of possible abuse of discretion because of a conflict of
interest or actual bias on the part of the evaluators). In fact, the focus of Celadon�s protest is on
the alleged conflicts on the part of all of the evaluators, a matter that the
agency has not yet adequately investigated. 


[7]
Moreover, it does not appear that it would be feasible to disturb the awards
already made under this solicitation.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Technology Select Sector Index (IXTTR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the technology sector which includes the following industries: computers and peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors and semi-conductor equipment; internet software and services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments and components; wireless telecommunication services; and office electronics. One cannot directly invest in an index.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Technology Select Sector Index (IXTTR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the technology sector which includes the following industries: computers and peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors and semi-conductor equipment; internet software and services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments and components; wireless telecommunication services; and office electronics. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
