Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.14% for A Shares, 1.65% for C Shares, 0.89% for I Shares and 0.65% for L Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares and 10/31/2017 for L Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a broad measure of the performance of developed countries' equity markets. The Diversified Composite Benchmark is a composite benchmark of unmanaged indexes that correspond to the Fund's model allocation, consisting of MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) (60%) and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (40%). The performance of the Lipper Mixed-Asset Target Allocation Growth Funds Index includes the deduction of expenses associated with mutual funds, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. The Fund's investment in equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. When the value of a fund's securities goes down, an investment in a fund decreases in value. The Fund invests in foreign securities, which are subject to special currency, political and economic risks. The Fund may also invest in futures contracts and other derivatives. This may make the Fund more volatile. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. The Fund may invest up to 15% in high yield securities. The fund may invest 25%-50% in U.S. and foreign fixed income securities.  The fund may invest 30%-75% in U.S. small-, medium-and large-cap equity securities. It may invest 0%-30% in foreign equity securities.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

TARGET DATE FUNDS. Target date funds are funds with the target date being the approximate date when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. Generally, the asset allocation of each fund will change on an annual basis with the asset allocation becoming more conservative as the fund nears the target retirement date. The principal value of the fund(s) is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.

	*TDFs may suffer investment losses, including near and following retirement. There is no guarantee that a TDF will provide adequate retirement income.

Trend Follower Aspect Capital Rolls with the Punches

							After some recent difficult years, the London-based firm makes the case for its strategy as a liquid diversifier for institutional investors.
						


By David Turner

Many asset managers suffered in the third quarter of this
    year, when stock and commodity markets plummeted worldwide. But
    for Aspect Capital, a $5 billion specialist in systematic trend
    following, it was a good time. The London-based firms
    $860 million Aspect Diversified Fund achieved a 14 percent
    return by shorting energy and metals.
Aspect uses computer-based models to identify incipient
    market trends and jump on them. The Diversified Funds
    recent performance built on a strong 2014, when it gained 32
    percent by going short on oil and long on bonds such as German
    Bunds and U.S. Treasuries at the right time.
But Aspect CEO Anthony Todd and president and research
    director Martin Lueck arent resting on their laurels.
    They remember the tough times of 2012 and 2013, when a lack of
    sustained rises and falls in most markets led to losses of 10.7
    percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, for the Diversified
    Fund. The strategy also slumped by 9.7 percent this April,
    thanks to a sharp reversal in equity markets that bucked the
    trend of rising prices identified in Aspects models.
    Thanks to its strong third quarter, the fund was still up 3.1
    percent for the year at the end of October.
Todd and Lueck helped pioneer trend following in the U.K. in
    the 1980s and co-founded Aspect back in 1997, but they still
    think they have a lot to learn about how market trends work.
    Trend following forever requires updating and evolution
    because markets evolve, Lueck explains. Hence the
    68-strong research and development team he watches over 
    more than half of the firms 114-member staff.
Mostly aimed at global institutional investors and funds of
    hedge funds, but also at 
    individual high-net-worth clients through distribution
    partnerships, the Diversified Fund is part of Aspects
    Diversified Programme strategy, which accounts for the bulk of
    the firms assets. This strategy also guides: $3.47
    billion in separate accounts; the $486 million Aspect
    Diversified Trends Fund, a European mutual fund under the UCITS
    structure that includes a mix of institutional and retail
    money; the $85 million Aspect Institutional Diversified Fund;
    and the $32 million Equinox Aspect Core Diversified Strategy
    Fund. The latter two vehicles are an ERISA-compliant offering
    for U.S. retirement plans and a 40 Act mutual fund,
    respectively. 
The UCITS fund, which Aspect primarily sells in Europe, has
    proved particularly attractive to multimanager diversified
    growth funds and wealth management firms. The 40 Act fund
    is available to U.S. institutions, but its main target is U.S.
    platforms that can distribute it to retail investors and their
    advisers.
Todd and Luecks experience as trend followers goes
    back much farther than the founding of Aspect. The two men
    studied physics together at the University of Oxford with
    another bright student named Michael Adam. After graduation,
    Lueck and Adam went to work for Adams father, a sugar
    importer based in London.
One day in 1983, old man Adam handed his son a book of
    technical trading models and said, See if theres
    anything in these, Lueck recalls. So together
    we developed some rudimentary computer models and discovered
    trend following. They had unwittingly reinvented the
    wheel: We didnt know there was already an industry
    doing this in the U.S., Lueck says.
Four years later Lueck, Adam and fellow trend-following
    expert David Harding founded London-based Adam, Harding and
    Lueck, a trend-following investment house, where Todd came to
    work as head of financial engineering and product development.
    AHLs client base was predominantly high-net-worth
    individuals, along with some funds of funds; the firm attracted
    relatively little direct institutional money.
In 1994 the firm was acquired by 
    Man Group, the U.K. alternative-investment giant. Man AHL,
    as its now called, manages $17.9 billion, or nearly one
    quarter of parent Man Groups assets.
Lueck and Harding departed AHL in 1996, Todd the following
    year. In 1997 Harding founded London-based Winton Capital
    Management, a trend-following commodity trading adviser that is
    now one of the worlds biggest hedge fund firms, with more
    than $30 billion in assets.
Todd and Lueck decided it was time to bring the systematic
    trend-following approach to the institutional investor
    community. We started Aspect with the belief that this
    should be in every institutional investors
    portfolio, Lueck says.
When making the case for why institutions should care about
    trend-following funds, Todd doesnt cite performance. But
    since its 1998 inception through this August, the Diversified
    Fund had posted an 8.8 percent average annual return, compared
    with 5.6 percent for the CISDM CTA Equal Weighted index, a
    measurement of returns for commodity-trading advisers, which
    pursue trend-following strategies. Its a liquid
    source of diversification for clients portfolios 
    its that lack of correlation that is good, Todd
    asserts.
The funds average correlation with stocks is
    pretty much zero, he estimates, but the correlation
    is dynamic; it changes depending on the trend that
    Aspect is following. Todd explains that the firms
    trend-following strategy hinges on pinpointing and acting on
    medium-term trends of two to six months, using an automated
    system based on the principle of serial autocorrelation, or
    the tendency for todays price movement to be
    slightly influenced by what happened yesterday and what
    happened last month.
The Diversified Fund trades in about 190 highly liquid
    financial instruments in 150 markets, most of them futures
    contracts, including those for stock indexes such as the
    S&P 500, commodities like Brent crude and interest
    rates.
Aspects trend following can involve shorting or buying
    into markets. For example, the Diversified Fund generated a
    25.4 percent return in 2008 by shorting equities and
    commodities and going long fixed-income. At other times the
    fund has switched into a positive correlation with stocks,
    purchasing them on the expectation that they will rise.
Aspect, which opened New York and Hong Kong offices in 2004
    and 2008, respectively, has attracted a diverse range of
    clients. About 60 percent of the firms assets come from
    institutions, including 
    pension funds, insurers and 
    sovereign wealth funds, with another 20 percent from funds
    of funds and the rest from distribution deals with wealth
    managers and private banks. Europe accounts for about 40
    percent of total assets, with another 30 percent from the
    Middle East, 15 percent from Asia and 15 percent from North
    America.
If the unique selling point of trend following is
    diversification, Aspect must keep turning over fresh stones to
    find it. The world has become a slightly more homogenous
    place over the time Ive been doing this, Todd says.
    Correlations between different markets have gone up over
    the past 20 or 30 years.
His solution: Keep going into new areas that are not yet
    highly linked with global financial markets. With that goal in
    mind, Aspects research team is doing simulated trading in
    
    Chinese futures contracts that were until recently barred
    to foreign investors, including plastics, glass and eggs.
    Besides offering diversification, such instruments meet the
    firms other key criterion: These contracts are
    extremely liquid, Lueck says.

Aspect Capital






 The renowned cluster of managed futures investment managers based in and around London have rebounded from the post-2008 credit crunch with renewed vigour. Evidence for this is found in the substantial increase in assets being managed by the longer established firms. Additional proof that the sector is in fine health is shown by the vibrant growth of a new range of fund operators.Aspect Capital, founded in 1997, is decidedly a member of the established group. It traces its roots all the way back to AHL, through its co-founder and director of research Martin Lueck who is the ‘L’ in the Man Group flagship. Anthony Todd, the other co-founder and CEO, also worked at AHL. Like Winton Capital, another venerable member of this managed futures elite, Aspect has grown strongly over the past 18 months. The seemingly insatiable appetite of institutional investors for commodity trading advisor strategies has seen Aspect grow to $6.8 billion from around $4.3 billion at the beginning of 2011.Like quite a few other CTAs, Aspect performed well during 2008. Where it has excelled in relation to its peers is in continuing to provide returns to investors since then. Even in 2011, when most hedge fund strategies suffered drawdowns, an occurrence in which CTAs proved to be no exception, the Aspect Diversified Fund strongly outperformed. During this time, Aspect has continued to invest heavily in its research team and in its operational infrastructure as well as in establishing a UCITS product that was designed from scratch. All of this made it an appropriate time to review developments at Aspect with John Wareham, the firm’s veteran, but youthful-looking, chief commercial officer. We discussed a wide range of issues central to the phenomenon that has propelled several leading London managers into the vanguard of the global managed futures sector.

Prospectus Objective: The Equinox Aspect Core Diversified Strategy Fund (the “Fund”) seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through exposure to a managed futures trading program offered by Aspect Capital Limited (“Aspect”).
Approach

Accesses 69 carefully selected and highly liquid futures markets across four global asset classes: commodities, currencies, fixed income and equity indices.


Deploys a systematic, medium-term trend following strategy that seeks to quantitatively identify and profit from directional moves in market prices.


Strives to produce returns that are not correlated with returns from traditional and other alternative asset classes.


Draws upon Aspect’s ongoing research into models and markets that seeks to deliver continuing enhancements to three main areas of the investment process:

Trade generation


Risk management


Trade execution



Additional features:

Daily liquidity


1940 Act regulation


1099 tax reporting


Futures Trading Style†

Trend Following: A strategy that generally seeks to identify the general direction of one or more global market segments (either up or down) using indicators such as current market prices and moving average prices, and buy or sell investments based on the assessment of these trade signals as determined before a trade is made. Trend-following generally focuses on the direction an investment or global market segment already has gone and not on the direction it may go.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
IMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURE
Mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal.
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
The Fund may be subject to liquidity risk primarily due to investments in derivatives. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities or instruments.
The use of futures contracts and derivative instruments will have the economic effect of financial leverage. Financial leverage magnifies exposure to the swings in prices of an asset class underlying an investment and may result in increased volatility and potentially greater gains or losses.  There is no assurance that the Fund’s investment in a derivative instrument with leveraged exposure to certain investments and markets will enable the Fund to achieve its investment objective. 
The use of futures contracts by Aspect Capital Limited, the Sub-Advisor for the Fund, is subject to special risk considerations, including, but not limited to, futures contracts having a high degree of price variability and subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes, possible lack of a liquid secondary market, possible market disruption or other extraordinary events,  losses caused by unanticipated market movements, Aspect’s inability to predict correctly the direction of instrument prices, interest rates, and currency exchange rates and other economic factors.
The trading decisions of the Sub-Adviser are based in part on mathematical models, which are implemented as automated computer algorithms that the Sub-Adviser has developed over time. The successful operation of the automated computer algorithms on which the Sub-Adviser’s trading decisions are based is reliant upon the Sub-Adviser’s information technology systems and its ability to ensure those systems remain operational and that appropriate disaster recovery procedures are in place. Further, as market dynamics shift over time, a previously highly successful model may become outdated, perhaps without the Sub-Adviser recognizing that fact before substantial losses are incurred. There can be no assurance that the Sub-Adviser will be successful in maintaining effective mathematical models and automated computer algorithms.
A substantial portion of the Fund’s assets may be invested in fixed income securities. In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. If a security issuer defaults on its payment obligations to the Fund, this default will cause the value of an investment in the Fund to decrease.
A significant portion of the Fund’s investment in futures contracts take place on foreign markets or exchanges and the Fund may have exposure to emerging markets due to investments in certain futures contracts linked to currencies and indices comprising emerging market equity securities. Adverse changes in currency exchange rates may erode or reverse any potential gains from the Fund’s investments.  Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative.  As a general rule, there is less legal and regulatory protection for investors in foreign markets than those investors in domestic markets. 
The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in a wholly-owned Subsidiary that will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and, unless otherwise noted in the Fund’s Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940 Act.  The Fund is a non-diversified investment company.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
IMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURE
Mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal.
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
The Fund may be subject to liquidity risk primarily due to investments in derivatives. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities or instruments.
The use of futures contracts and derivative instruments will have the economic effect of financial leverage. Financial leverage magnifies exposure to the swings in prices of an asset class underlying an investment and may result in increased volatility and potentially greater gains or losses.  There is no assurance that the Fund’s investment in a derivative instrument with leveraged exposure to certain investments and markets will enable the Fund to achieve its investment objective. 
The use of futures contracts by Aspect Capital Limited, the Sub-Advisor for the Fund, is subject to special risk considerations, including, but not limited to, futures contracts having a high degree of price variability and subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes, possible lack of a liquid secondary market, possible market disruption or other extraordinary events,  losses caused by unanticipated market movements, Aspect’s inability to predict correctly the direction of instrument prices, interest rates, and currency exchange rates and other economic factors.
The trading decisions of the Sub-Adviser are based in part on mathematical models, which are implemented as automated computer algorithms that the Sub-Adviser has developed over time. The successful operation of the automated computer algorithms on which the Sub-Adviser’s trading decisions are based is reliant upon the Sub-Adviser’s information technology systems and its ability to ensure those systems remain operational and that appropriate disaster recovery procedures are in place. Further, as market dynamics shift over time, a previously highly successful model may become outdated, perhaps without the Sub-Adviser recognizing that fact before substantial losses are incurred. There can be no assurance that the Sub-Adviser will be successful in maintaining effective mathematical models and automated computer algorithms.
A substantial portion of the Fund’s assets may be invested in fixed income securities. In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. If a security issuer defaults on its payment obligations to the Fund, this default will cause the value of an investment in the Fund to decrease.
A significant portion of the Fund’s investment in futures contracts take place on foreign markets or exchanges and the Fund may have exposure to emerging markets due to investments in certain futures contracts linked to currencies and indices comprising emerging market equity securities. Adverse changes in currency exchange rates may erode or reverse any potential gains from the Fund’s investments.  Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative.  As a general rule, there is less legal and regulatory protection for investors in foreign markets than those investors in domestic markets. 
The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in a wholly-owned Subsidiary that will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and, unless otherwise noted in the Fund’s Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940 Act.  The Fund is a non-diversified investment company.
The Fund may frequently buy and sell portfolio securities and other assets to rebalance the Fund’s exposure to various market sectors. Higher portfolio turnover may result in the Fund paying higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for investors.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objective, risks, changes, and expenses of the Fund.

The performance data quoted here represents past performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Adviser has contractually agreed to reduce its advisory fee and/or reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, to ensure that the Fund’s total annual operating expenses, excluding (i) taxes, (ii) interest, (iii) extraordinary items, (iv) “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,” and (v) brokerage commissions, do not exceed, on an annual basis, 1.70% with respect to Class A shares, 2.45% with respect to Class C shares and 1.45% with respect to Class I shares of the Fund’s average daily net assets. The Adviser has contractually agreed to reduce its fees and/or reimburse expenses of the Fund until at least November 5, 2017. This agreement cannot be terminated without the consent of the Fund’s Board of Trustees on 60 days’ written notice to the Adviser.  Please review the Fund’s Prospectus for more detail on the expense waiver. Results shown reflect the waiver, without which the results could have been lower. A Fund's performance, especially for very short periods of time, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decisions.

Equinox Investment Philosophy and Process
At Equinox Funds, we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add long-term value to an investment strategy. With this philosophy in mind, the Equinox portfolio management team employs the following six-step investment process:




 SCREEN
After determining a Fund or Program’s goals and objectives, the Portfolio Team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates.


 ANALYZE
During this stage, the Portfolio Team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance, volatility and strategy discipline.


 SELECT
The next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization, personnel, investment process and operations.


 CONSTRUCT
At this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return, risk, correlation and drawdown metrics.


 MANAGE
Once the initial candidates are identified, the Portfolio Team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics.


 REBALANCE
Continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary.


Throughout the process, our goal is to provide investors with high-quality alternative investment portfolios that — when added to an asset allocation strategy — can potentially reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in a wholly-owned Subsidiary that will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and, unless otherwise noted in the Fund’s Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940 Act.  The Fund is a non-diversified investment company.
The Fund may frequently buy and sell portfolio securities and other assets to rebalance the Fund’s exposure to various market sectors. Higher portfolio turnover may result in the Fund paying higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for investors.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objective, risks, changes, and expenses of the Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the Fund’s Prospectus or Summary Prospectus which can be obtained by calling 1.888.643.3431.

Aspect Capital launches newcits version of flagship fund

Weekly UCITS News (Friday)











London-headquartered systematic investment manager, Aspect Capital, has officially launched the Aspect Diversified Trends Fund. The Dublin-domiciled UCITS III-compliant OEIC began trading 29th December 2010 and is now available to institutional investors. The newcits is an onshore variant of the firm’s Aspect Diversified Program (the offshore fund being Aspect Diversified Fund) - a systematic product that uses trading algorithms to capture momentum in medium-term trends across a range of deep, liquid futures markets. Speaking with Hedgeweek, Aspect Capital’s Sales Manager for UK and Europe, Ted Frith, said the performance of the Diversified Trends newcits would be “almost identical” to its offshore counterpart and would have the same risk target. “We intend to minimize tracking error and surprise,” said Frith. “The volatility target will be +17 per cent.” In Bloomberg’s top-100 performing funds in 2010, the Aspect Diversified Fund ranked 35, generating +15.36 per cent returns. Frith confirmed that the fund had already attracted interest in Germany and Italy: “We have three external investors already and a further dozen are looking to finalise due diligence in the next two to four weeks.” The fund will be marketed to institutions in Scandinavia and possibly France but anticipates less demand from UK institutional investors. 
Traditionally, German investors have found it difficult to invest in offshore funds. But as more hedgies adopt the cloak of transparency under UCITS III regulations, it appears alternative onshore strategies, such as the Aspect newcits, are now on their radar. “German investors have traditionally focused on the fixed income world, which has started to become a problem for a number of schemes,” said Frith, adding that falling bond yields are causing them to open up to the idea of using managed futures to diversify their portfolios. 
Aspect built the fund in-house. “We’ve listened to clients’ gripes about costs, counterparty risk, tracking issues, taken this feedback onboard and designed a superior product,” explained Frith. Aspect’s CEO, Anthony Todd (pictured), said: “I am confident that the Aspect Diversified Trends Fund will prove to be an extremely competitive and attractive option to a wide range of investors.” The main advantage to this is that Aspect can be rigorous when choosing service providers. Those chosen, with Aspect as investment manager, include: Quintillion, the fund’s independent administrator; BNY Mellon as custodian, and KPMG for auditing. Quintillion, along with Aspect, will independently value the fund’s derivatives contracts daily, with Newedge appointed as swap counterparty. “The key now is to get to critical size: ideally USD100million as quickly as possible,” said Frith.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.14% for A Shares, 1.65% for C Shares, 0.89% for I Shares and 0.65% for L Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares and 10/31/2017 for L Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a broad measure of the performance of developed countries' equity markets. The Diversified Composite Benchmark is a composite benchmark of unmanaged indexes that correspond to the Fund's model allocation, consisting of MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) (60%) and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (40%). The performance of the Lipper Mixed-Asset Target Allocation Growth Funds Index includes the deduction of expenses associated with mutual funds, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. The Fund's investment in equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. When the value of a fund's securities goes down, an investment in a fund decreases in value. The Fund invests in foreign securities, which are subject to special currency, political and economic risks. The Fund may also invest in futures contracts and other derivatives. This may make the Fund more volatile. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. The Fund may invest up to 15% in high yield securities. The fund may invest 25%-50% in U.S. and foreign fixed income securities.  The fund may invest 30%-75% in U.S. small-, medium-and large-cap equity securities. It may invest 0%-30% in foreign equity securities.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
