            AJS Bancorp is the holding company for the A.J. Smith Federal Savings Bank. More than 100 years ago, Arthur J. Smith arrived from New York and used his financial expertise to provide the dream of home ownership for the growing population of Chicago. As the A.J.

From its Midlothian and Orland Park locations in Illinois, the bank offers a full line of retail savings and lending services in addition to insurance and investment products.

Book value per share was $14.94 at March 31, 2017 as compared to $15.46 at March 31, 2016. Return on average assets was 0.10% against 0.33% for the same period a year ago. Return on average equity was 0.62% against 2.05% for the same period a year ago. The $122,000 decrease in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period was mainly attributable to a $185,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, and a $35,000 decrease in gain on sale of securities, partially offset by a $67,000 decrease in non-interest expense and a $49,000 decrease in income tax expense.
