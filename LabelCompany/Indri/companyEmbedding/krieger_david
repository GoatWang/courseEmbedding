Dave and I worked closely on the go-to-market strategy and communicated consistently on new ways to grow the business. I enjoyed Dave's passion and consider him a true asset to any team.See moreSee lessWhile the VP of Sales at GBG Incorporated, I hired David Krieger.  One of the things that I like about David is that he has a keen sense of who he is.  He understands his strengths and weaknesses, which allows him to adjust his behavior to take advantage of his strengths.

David is extremely coachable.  He listens well and applies what he learns to his sales process.  Although, he was new the HVAC industry, David learned quickly and did a great job of developing new business in his territory.

He is a team player.  An excellent communicator, David shared his plans for the market with his team.  He held himself accountable to getting the job done, which made him very easy to manage.

I would recommend David to anyone interested in a sales professional who understands the selling process and how to develop new business.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidGroupsBuffalo State AlumniLexmark AlumniPRO AVModern Distribution Management’s Independent Distributor NetworkTech Data Group Employee & Alumni Alliance NetworkView David’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David’s Full ProfileNot the David you’re looking for?

Inspiring examples of individuals working for an end to the nuclear threat showcase the role everyday people can play in the quest for peace. Particular encouragement is given to young people to build on their natural idealism to shape the world they will inherit.  Bookseller Inventory # B9780967469768

Did David Krieger Scam A Florida County?

/ Did David Krieger Scam A Florida County?
 















Osceola County Taxpayers Angry That Convicted Fraudster David Krieger Was Paid $34,500 For Garbage Audit
 
The much ballyhooed audit prepared by David Krieger for the Osceola County Clerk of the Courts that was supposed to lead to mass prosecutions for mortgage document fraud by lenders and foreclosure mills has turned into a political nightmare for Clerk Armando Ramirez.
At a cost of $34,500, David Krieger’s 362 page report was presented to the Osceola County back in January was not made available to the public until last week. The report accuses mortgage lenders, document preparation companies and foreclosure mill attorneys from across Florida of filing over 800 fraudulent documents in Osceola County.
However, Orange-Osceola State Attorney Jeff Ashton refuses to bring criminal charges against lenders and foreclosure mill operators. Ashton’s office told the Orlando Sentinel, “Mr. Ashton has gone on record that our office reviewed the report, but from the perspective of a criminal investigation — it did not meet certain criteria. There were no witness statements, no victims, no evidentiary trail,”

Ashton’s office then pointed Ramirez to the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office saying, “The issue should be first investigated by law enforcement, thus we provided the report to the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office.“
Ramirez and his staff carted 17 cartons of property records to the Osceola County Sheriff Economic Crimes Unit.
The Economic Crimes Unit investigation spent 1,000 hours investigating the contents of David Krieger’s report at an additional cost $23,700 without finding a single crime.
Foreclosure Defense Attorney, Matt Weidner, who was one of the first reputable foreclosure defense attorneys to review the report last week wrote on his blog, “The worst thing about this is the logo and trust of the clerk of court is being used to give this report…full of incorrect statements of law and fact….credibility and authority.”
David Krieger’s report for is more about his tin-foil hat political beliefs than it is about proving any criminal activity.
The report is a product of David Krieger’s paranoia of government oppression and his tin-foil hat political beliefs than it is about mortgage or document fraud. The report relies on outdated and debunked legal arguments, unsubstantiated claims of criminal wrong doing, conspiracy theories and misrepresentations of the law. The report also shows that his “hand-picked” auditors are not the mortgage experts they claim to be nor do they have the foreclosure litigation experience necessary to give this report any credibility.
Armando Ramirez is now in hot water with Osceola County voters and the County Commission for causing the county to spend nearly $60,000 on David Krieger’s garbage report (which you can read below) in a No-Bid Contract. Ramirez has not publicly stated why he a gave David Krieger a no-bid contract. However, Krieger’s contract that Ramirez signed on July 24, 2014, states:

“[It] shall be for the purpose of supplying forensic evidence to the State’s Attorney for criminal and eventual civil prosecution. The clerk agrees that he has exercised care and due diligence in determining the competency of [Krieger] to conduct such a forensic examination.”

On his website, Krieger claims he was hired by Ramirez because Ramirez was a fan of his book, Clouded Titles.
David Krieger, a self-proclaimed Quiet Title Expert and author of the self-published DIY foreclosure defense book, Clouded Titles,  travels around the country like a traveling carnival barker pawning a “Get A Free House From Your Lender” scam like Neil Garfield and Garfield’s former protege, former Florida lawyer and convicted mortgage fraudster, Carol Asbury.
David Krieger’s DIY foreclosure defense program, like the program Garfield promotes, is filled with so much factually incorrect data and debunked legal arguments that its only purpose seems to be to entice desperate homeowners facing foreclosure and clueless foreclosure activists to spend their last hard earned dollars to purchase his merchandise instead of using it to hire a competent attorney. 
David Krieger, like Garfield, has no experience in mortgage finance, mortgage lending, title abstracting or title preparation. However, Krieger does have plenty of experience scamming people and defrauding the federal government.
According to a federal indictment unsealed on May 16, 1996, David Krieger was part of an anti-government domestic terrorist group with ties to militia groups and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. Krieger’s group funded their activities through a nationwide mortgage fraud network known as “Family Farm Preservation.” 
Krieger and his minions sold fake money orders to unsuspecting homeowners seeking to pay off FHA and Rural Development mortgages.
On the day he was indicted, Krieger was arrested in east Texas by FBI agents after a three-year investigation. Records show that Krieger was one of nine ringleaders who were arrested who used a small army of hucksters to sell the fake money orders.
The indictment stated that in a single week in 1993, Krieger sold and mailed $344,733 in bogus money orders for clients to banks, government offices and mortgage companies. Krieger also used the worthless money orders to try to pay his own debts, including almost $6,000 for child support payments in Kansas.
David Krieger was held for five days in the Smith County Jail in Tyler, Texas, and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and six lesser felony charges involving three counts of fraud and three counts of swindling.
Krieger avoided prison by ratting out his eight co-defendants, who received up to 16 years in prison. He was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and sentenced Feb. 5, 1997, to three months of home confinement followed by three years of probation and a fine.
After serving his three month sentence of sitting on his living room sofa eating Bonbons watching daytime TV, Krieger worked as a wedding entertainer and a voice-over specialist known as Airwave Dave. He also traveled the American south working as an Austin Powers impersonator at minor-league baseball and hockey games. 
A TV reporter before his arrest, Krieger has written two self-published books on foreclosure defense while working as a paralegal and consultant. He appears regularly on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ internet website, “Infowars” and Tea Party Patriot Wingnut Joyce Riley’s Power Hour promoting his books and his paranoia fueled anti-government views.
