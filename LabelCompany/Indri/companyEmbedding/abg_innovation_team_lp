ABG LAB





























TECHNOLOGIES








"We create technologies and formulate solutions that dramatically yet safely enhance cosmetic and pharmaceutical products targeting skin rejuvenation."
- Dr. Elina Tester, President & CEO of ABG LAB

As the President and CEO of Premier Pharma and ABG Labs, Dr. Tester is internationally renowned for her revolutionary anti-aging technologies and treatments. Dr. Tester has 15 years experience spearheading the development of an array of cutting edge skin care technologies that have revolutionized how doctors can choose to treat the signs of a prematurely aged face showing the classic signs of skin damage.

Dr. Tester is overturning the established norms of anti-aging medicine and getting great results doing it. Not only a “quick fix” for more beautiful skin, Dr. Tester’s treatments get to the core causes of skin aging. Premier Pharma and ABG Lab created an array of technologies that aim to do one thing, regenerate aging skin: by altering gene expression, by stimulating adult stem cell activity and repairing skin at the cellular level. Thus, improving skin homeostasis and cellular performance.




ANTI-AGING: TOPICAL SKINCARE
ANTI-AGING: COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORMS




A 15-year topical skincare technology leader with a remarkable record of innovation and global outreach strategically allied to laboratories in USA, Russia and Korea. Today ABG LAB produces innovative injection and topical anti-aging skin treatments for demanding doctor & aesthetician markets.

Technology Overview









"In mastering these anti-aging injection platforms, the products from ABG LAB produce visible results that surpass other dermatological injections and are the comparable to ones of advanced cosmetic surgical procedures. ABG LAB’s injection platforms are safe, minimally invasive and without surgical side effects."
- Dr. Boris Petrikovsky, Senior Science Advisor for ABG LAB


Building on its success in topical skincare innovation, as a result of 10-years of R&D and company’s own investments, ABG LAB has developed three original technology platforms for the total regeneration of aging & photo-damaged skin:




GENERATION I:
P199™biomimmetic oligopeptide platform
Target:renew aging and depleted skin cell population

P199™ biomimmetic oligopeptide platform stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of adult skin stem cells, epidermal stem cells and dermal (mesenchymal) stem cells.
P199™ biomimmetic oligopeptide (INCI-name: sh-Oligopeptide-72), also known as Stem Cell Wharton Jelly Peptide P199™, is a peptide syntheticized by R&D team of ABG LAB lead by Dr.Elina Tester and Dr.Boris Petrikovsky as a part of the research and study of Wharton’s Jelly, aiming to help burn victims recover quicker and with less chance of infection by signaling the skin to renew itself more quickly. It is a biotechnological synthetic product ultra-purified and placed into a buffered solution.

"Wharton’s Jelly, a gelatinous substance found within the umbilical cord, is a mixture of water, gelatin, lipids, proteins, and enzymes. Remaining the least-studied part of the composition of the umbilicus, Wharton’s Jelly is a rich source of stem cells, fetal specific proteins, fatty acids, and phospholipids.
For this reason Dr. Tester and I conducted research on a bioactive complex from Wharton’s Jelly. We wanted to explore the application of a specific peptide from Wharton’s Jelly to incite the safe & efficient arousal stem cells in adult skin. We succeeded. And thereby duplicated in adult skin the magnificent regenerative process seen in fetal skin. As a result of these years of scientific work, ABG LAB is now isolating this peptide and synthesizing it chemically. The preparation is called Wharton Jelly Peptide P199™."
- Dr. Boris Petrikovsky, Senior Science Advisor for ABG LAB


P199™ biomimmetic oligopeptide platform is tested and proven to:

Improve the vital stem-cell niche (environment)
Increase keratinocyte & fibroblast proliferation
Increaase large colony formation
Stimulate stem cells’ ability to self-replicate (make an exact stem cell duplicate thereby maintaining optimal skin stem-cell numbers long-term)


Technology Overview




GENERATION II: 
F199™ epigenetic complex platform
Target: up-regulate genes that defend and protect skin cells from effects of photo-damage and aging

The F199™ epigenetic complex platform is tested and proven to:

Up-regulate genes to protect skin cells
Photo-damage prevention
Repair damaged cells 


Technology Overview





GENERATION III:
M199™ autopagy complex platform
Target:stimulate autophagy to regenerate mitochondria, increase energy production and extend cell longevity

M199™ autopagy complex platform is ABG LAB’s breakthrough 3rd Generation Cell-Longevity Technology that works in synergy with P199™ and F199™ platforms.
Aging is a process in which the continual build up of damage to molecules and organelles leads to a progressive decline in cellular function and to tissue deterioration. The solution is ABG LAB‘s Meso-M199™: an anti-aging cosmetic injection to induce Autophagy in skin cells.
Autophagy: The key to cell function & longevity
Autophagy is the protein and organelle (mitochondria) quality control mechanism that maintains normal cellular homeostasis in the skin tissue.
By inducing Autophagy, Meso-M199™ boosts cell function & extends cellular longevity. Autophagy is cell self-digestion via lysosomes that clears cellular waste, including defectively modified proteins and damaged organelles, including impaired mitochondria.
