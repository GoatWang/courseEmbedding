The career path of

Monique F. Leroux





Monique F. Leroux was the Chair of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Desjardins Group from 2008 to 2016. Desjardins is the largest cooperative financial group in Canada, with assets of nearly $250 billion, which also ranks fifth in the world. Desjardins is one of the 20 largest employers in Canada, supported by the skills of its 45,000 employees and the commitment of more than 5,000 elected officers. Drawing on the strength of its caisse network in Quebec and Ontario and its subsidiaries across Canada, Desjardins Group offers a full range of financial products and services to its millions of members and clients. Desjardins specializes in wealth management, life and health insurance, property and casualty insurance, personal services, and business and institutional services. 


Under her leadership, Desjardins Group has received a great deal of recognition. In 2014, Corporate Knights Magazine ranked Desjardins fifth on its list of the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada and named it the second most sustainable financial institution in the world. Mediacorp named it one of Canada’s Top 100 Employers and a Top Family-Friendly Employer in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Financial Post included Desjardins on its list of the 10 Best Companies to Work For in 2012, Aon Hewitt named it one of Canada’s Best Employers in Canada in 2014, and Mediacorp ranked it one of Canada’s Greenest Employers and Canada’s Top Employers for Young People in 2015. 


Bolstered by the mobilization of Desjardins Group’s elected officers and managers, she has defined a performance-based strategic vision for the future of Desjardins Group that is strongly rooted in its cooperative mission and values. Ms. Leroux has chosen to focus on service, growth and efficiency for the benefit of its members and clients and to improve the organization’s financial strength—as evidenced by Desjardins ranking first on Bloomberg’s 2015 list on the strongest financial institution in North America and fifth in the world.


From the beginning of Ms. Leroux’s first term, Desjardins Group has sustained continued nationwide growth and has seen a number of successful acquisitions and strategic partnerships both at home and abroad (Western Financial Group, MGI Financial and Qtrade Financial Group). In 2015, Desjardins also acquired State Farm’s Canadian operations. Finally, Desjardins has signed a cooperation agreement with Crédit Mutuel, a top-tier mutualist financial institution in Europe. This partnership has resulted in, among other things, the launch of Monetico International, resulting in better services for members. 


A member of the senior management team since 2001, Ms. Leroux has held a number of roles, including President of Desjardins Financial Corporation and CEO of its subsidiaries. Under her leadership, the Corporation and its subsidiaries achieved significant business growth and improvements to their financial performance. From 2004 to 2008, she was Chief Financial Officer of Desjardins Group.


Before joining Desjardins, Ms. Leroux held the position of Senior Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer at Quebecor Inc. Prior to that, she was Senior Vice President, Quebec Division, at RBC Royal Bank, where she was also Senior Vice-President, Finance. Previously with Ernst & Young, Ms. Leroux was Managing Partner of services to the Quebec financial industry and Managing Partner in charge of auditing and consulting for national and international companies. A member of Ernst & Young’s Strategy Committee for the corporate and large business sectors, she was responsible for their Sales and Marketing Group for Eastern Canada.


In 2016, Ms. Leroux was appointed Chair of the Board of Investissement Québec and Chair of the Quebec Economic and Innovation Council by the Quebec Government.


On November 13, 2015, at the International co-operative Alliance’s global conference and general assembly, in Turkey, members elected Monique F. Leroux, as their President and thereby became the first Canadian and first North American to be appointed to this prestigious role. Already active with the Alliance as a board member, she is also a member of the board of CIC, a subsidiary of Crédit Mutuel, of the Executive Committee of the International Confederation of Popular Banks and chairs the High Level Contact Group of the European Association of Co-operative Banks. In the interest of promoting and gaining recognition for the cooperative model, Ms. Leroux founded the International Summit of Cooperatives, an event first held in October 2012 in Quebec City to mark the International Year of Cooperatives. Given its success, she also served as the co-chair of the second (2014) and third edition of the International Summit of Cooperatives in October 2016, which once again brought 3,000 participants from more than 116 countries to Quebec City.


In 2015, Ms. Leroux was asked to represent the Canadian business group at the B7 Summit in Berlin, at the G7 Forum for Dialogue with Women under Chancellor Angela Merkel and at the G20 Leaders' Summit.

Ms. Leroux is also a member of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, the Founders’ Council of the Quebec Global 100 Network, and the Bureau des gouverneurs du Conseil du patronat du Québec. In 2010, she was also a member of the expert panel that led the Review of Federal Support to R&D.

She also took 19th place in Canadian Business Magazine’s list of Canada’s 50 Most Powerful Business People and was named one of 20 outstanding women by the Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activity. 


In 2013, Ms. Leroux became a member of the Order of Canada, an officer of l’Ordre national du Québec, Chevalier de l’Ordre national de la Légion d’Honneur and Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the Régiment de la Chaudière.

She was named Woman of Outstanding Achievement by the Women’s Y Foundation and Quebec’s Financial Person of the Year by Finance et Investissement. 


In 2011, she received the Woodrow Wilson Award for her contribution to Canadian society from the Canada Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (USA), as well as the Centre Jacques Cartier medal. She was also selected as one of the year’s honourees by the Public Policy Forum and was named a champion of The Catalyst Canada Honours. 


In 2010, Ms. Leroux was featured in Les Affaires in a tribute to daring entrepreneurs and business people, and she was also named one of 25 Transformational Canadians by the Globe and Mail, CTV and La Presse. In the same year, she was awarded the Prix Réalisations by the Réseau des femmes d’affaires du Québec (Quebec business women’s network). In 2008, she was named Personality of the Year by Les Affaires and Personnalité de la Francophonie économique by the Canadian chapter of the Forum francophone des affaires. Also a three-time honouree on the Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 list, Ms. Leroux was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Toronto-based Women’s Executive Network in 2008.


Ms. Leroux is also committed to her profession and to her community.

B20: fostering the international growth of smes
Today, on the 2nd of December, I have the pleasure of participating in the discussions of the B20, the international business community forum that makes recommendations to the G20 leaders. My involvement in this forum is a direct outcome of the International Summit of Cooperatives, which led to the recognition on the part of the B20 of the importance of cooperatives as levers of sustainable development around the world.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Monique Leroux: Leading Change at DesjardinsMonique Leroux: Leading Change at DesjardinsMonique F. Leroux graduated from the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi with a business degree and became a chartered accountant. She was one of the first female partners at what is now Ernst & Young and, at the age of 38, became the first female president of the Order of Chartered Accountants of Quebec. In 1998 Ms Leroux was selected as RBC’s Quebec Senior Vice-President and soon after moved to become Senior Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer of Quebecor Inc.Leroux is currently the Chair of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Desjardins Group, Canada's  leading cooperative financial group and the first woman to lead a major Canadian financial institution.Monique F. LerouxCapital flow between countries increaseFinancial services industry becomes increasingly globalizedFinancial Service firms grow to keep up by merging, expanding internationally, and providing diverse servicesGrowth results in complex services offerings and competition among firmsCanadian Banking and Financial Services IndustryMonique Leroux:Leading Change at DesjardinsWhat exactly is a "financial cooperative" and how does it work?Leroux and Desjardins Leroux joined Desjardins in 2001, and was appointed as the groups Chief Financial Officer three years later in 2004In 2008 she was elected President, taking on the responsibility of leading the world’s sixth-largest cooperative financial group, with assets of more than $173 billion and 5.8 million members and clientsMs Leroux has since worked diligently to define a new strategic vision for the future of the Desjardins Group, one that is strongly rooted in its cooperative mission and valuesThe 70sPresentLate 90sIn an attempt to grow and keep up with competitors many  Canadian banks proposed mergers n the late 1990'sThey were subsequently turned down for anti-trust reasons howeverIn response banks began to consolidate with trust companies, insurers, and securities dealers in order to provide a package of financial products and services with the help of the technological innovations of the decadeIn 2007 when the global financial system was in crisis, Canada was impacted minimally due to the countries high regulation standards for banking In 2008 the Global Competitiveness Report it was determined that Canada had the best banking system in the worldToday Canada's "Big Five" Banks (Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion, Ban of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial) all have a strong national presenceDesjardins currently dominates in Quebec, the firms province of originThe Desjardins GroupThe Desjardins Group (or Mouvement des caisses Desjardins in French) is the largest financial cooperative or association of credit unions in North AmericaIt was founded in 1900 in Lévis, Quebec by Alphonse Desjardins.Based out of Quebec but also located in Ontario, Manitoba, and New Brunswick, Desjardins has 513 caisses with 6,300 elected officers and total assets of 152.3 billionThe Desjardins Group has over 20 subsidiaries offering products and services related to insurance (Desjardins Financial Security, Desjardins General Insurance), real estate (Place Desjardins), venture capital funds (Desjardins Venture Capital) and brokerage (Desjardins Securities)The Desjardins Group, through subsidiary Développement international Desjardins, is also active in over 50 developing countries through technical assistance programs and various investmentsA financial services provider that is owned and operated by its membersThe goal of a financial cooperative is to act on behalf of a unified group as a traditional banking service These institutions attempt to differentiate themselves by offering above-average service along with competitive rates in the areas of insurance, lending and investment dealings.Often see themselves as different from mainstream banks, with a mission to be "community-oriented" and "serve people, not profit"What is a Financial Cooperative?How does it work?Elected representatives on many levels form numerous groups and attend meetings and conventions to guide the direction of the groupAt Desjardins, caisse members vote on a board of directors that will oversee their specific caisse, delegates from each caisses' board are then chosen to represent them at an annual meeting of about 25 caisses'. Each of the 17 regions with about 100 delegtes each choose 15 for the Council of Representatives that meets monthly. The 17 Councils of Representatives form the 255 members of the Assembly of Representatives, who meet 2-3 times a year. The assembly elects the combined office Chairman, President and CEO of the Group every 4 yearsDiffers from banks and other financial institutions in that those who have accounts are its members and owners, and they elect their board of directors in a one-person-one-vote system regardless of their amount invested1. Too many individual representatives and electoral processeseach representative has ideas and agendas of their ownconstant elections and meetings/conventions that are likely to overlap2. Lack of integration among entities, and communication between themIn 2001, 11 federations merged together to increase the firms efficiency and to centralize control of the services offeredRather than further organize the institution however, the merger recalled the previous organizational structure of distinct legal entities operating under one nameDesjardins' legacy as "a collection of small companies" became less of a term for the familial relationship among subsidiaries and instead became the root of internal competition and inefficiency due to separate and independent infastructure, programming, governance, procedures and policiesGovernance IssuesIn 2008, soon after the US housing crisis and a globally felt economic threat, Desjardins held an election for the cooperatives next President/CEOLeroux's Platform for ChangeIncreased Communication"Non Cooperative" Decision Making-Leroux believed that in order to compete effectively in a demanding and changing financial services industry and survive the global financial crisis, Desjardins needed to integrate, consolidate, and determine how to preserve traditional values while preparing for the future and emerging as a less provincial financial groupElection of 2008Monique Leroux ran for the position despite the impending economic crisis, having to make the time for running a campaign in addition to her responsibilities as acting CFO, and despite being a woman in the "boys club" of the finance industry Leroux Leads the Change"the purpose is not growth for the sake of growth, or to drive up the share price; it’s to provide the long-term benefit for members”"Living Desjardin with trust and confidence"Campaign Slogan:After winning the election, Ms. Leroux implemented an unprecedented organizational restructuring at DesjardinsLeroux was very focused on the future and having her elected officers and employees be apart of the companies choice of directionShe began by having the  Assembly of Representatives meet and discuss issues that concern them and having them name the top 10 problems they found most concerning (inc. market expansion, productivity, social responsibility.. etc.)Next Leroux created 10 "reflection" groups, one representing each of the issues, of 15-25 people from around the federationLeroux used the groups results to better organize the subsidiaries of Desjardins around 4 types of business (Wealth Management and Life Insurance, Personal Services, Business and Institutional Services, and Property and Casualty Insurance)Under these groupings here was now structure and centralized support for previously independent services.Since the 2001 merger that was accomplished quickly but fell sort of the goal of central organization, many Desjardins executives felt there was a disconnect between the federation and the caissesTo achieve the goal of "One Desjardins," they planned to use the central organization to their advantageCommunication heavily increased, as some executives began to establish monthly conference calls with caisse general managers, and others created small groups of caisses, led by a VP would be in close contact with board members and other general managersThese practices helped achieve trust between all parties and ensured everyone's needs were heard "Reflection" GroupsIncreased CommunicationAlthough Monique Leroux's run for the Chairman/CEO/Presidentof Desjardins was not easy, she not only won the position, and maintained her values, she changed the financial groups structure in very forward-thinking and innovative ways no one thought to be possible at all let alone within in just a year of serviceToday Leroux is one of the most successful women in Canada due to her contributions not only to banking, but to productivity, equality, and centralization-Monique F.

Article
SpeechPlease note: Speeches appear in the language in which they were delivered.Madame la chancelière,Monsieur le recteur,Monsieur le doyen,Chers finissants, chères finissantes,Distingués invités,Je tiens tout d’abord à exprimer ma reconnaissance au sénat de l’Université d’Ottawa et à l’École de gestion Telfer. Je me sens privilégiée de recevoir un doctorat honorifique d’une grande université qui prône des valeurs qui me sont très chères. Entre autres, celle de « contribuer à l’amélioration des collectivités en formant des citoyens du monde ».Je tiens d’ailleurs à souligner que l’Université d’Ottawa joue un rôle actif dans la mise en valeur de l’histoire des caisses populaires en Ontario. Son Centre de recherche en civilisation canadienne-française conserve en effet les archives des caisses populaires de l’Ontario. Son site Internet fait même état du rôle-clé qu’a joué Alphonse Desjardins, le fondateur du Mouvement Desjardins, dans la naissance du mouvement coopératif en Ontario. Je tiens à vous témoigner, madame la Chancellière et monsieur le Recteur, toute notre appréciation.La ville d’Ottawa a d’ailleurs été très importante pour Alphonse Desjardins. Comme sténographe français de la Chambre des communes,il y a résidé six mois par année pendant 25 ans.C’est aussi à la Chambre des communes qu’ila pris conscience des ravages causés par les prêts usuraires. C’est à la bibliothèque du Parlement qu’il a mené ses recherches pour trouver un moyen d’y remédier. Et c’est ici que son projet de caisse populaire a pris forme.Cet honneur qui m’est rendu aujourd’hui par l’Université d’Ottawa,je veux donc le dédier à Alphonse Desjardins. Je souhaite aussi le partager avec l’ensemble des dirigeants du Mouvement des caisses Desjardins qui m’ont accordé le privilège de les représenter, de même qu’avec mes collaborateurs et collaboratrices qui forment la grande équipe Desjardins. Je salue d’ailleurs monsieur Donat Boulerice, président de la Fédération des caisses de l’Ontario et membre du conseil du Mouvement, ainsi que nombreux dirigeants élus et directeurs généraux qui me font la grâce de leur présence ce matin.Jepartage enfin cet honneur avec ma famille et mes proches, qui m’ont soutenue tout au long de mon parcours. Tout comme mes beaux-parents qui ont fait leurs études à l’Université d’Ottawa, je me réjouis d’en devenir à mon tour, une fière diplômée!Congratulations to fellow graduatesI am very proud to be a member of the Telfer School of Management Class of 2012.  And I truly share the pride of my fellow graduates for reaching this important step in their lives.I take this opportunity to congratulate you all.  This is a wonderful day for you and for your parents, friends and professors who encouraged and supported you throughout your studies.Bravo à vous tous!This morning, I would like to talk to you about cooperation, which is about essentially personal commitment and solidarity.You are graduates of a business school that meets the standards of the most demanding international ranking organizations. As such, you acquired a highly valuable body of knowledge you can now use to carve out your niche in society. A body of knowledge you can also use, as future business leaders, to help build a better world.In the financial tumult of the past few years, the capitalist business model has showed some of its limits. Personally, I believe there is a need for a plural economy. One that offers complementary business models which counteract the excesses of one another. In my opinion, the best formula includes a market economy with companies governed by sound regulations, a highly effective public sector, and – I am sure you see where I am going! – a strong cooperative sector.Cooperation: a valuable business modelAs Dean Julien mentioned in my citation, the United Nations has declared 2012 the “International Year of Cooperatives.” And I would like to take this opportunity to talk to you about cooperatives.On one hand, I believe that − alongside with the corporate and public sectors –cooperatives offers great opportunities for business school graduates like you.  Both in terms of jobs and community involvement.On the other hand, we have not yet developed the full potential of this human, inclusive, innovative, participative, resilient and sustainable business model. There again, I believe cooperatives may offer an appealing avenue to many entrepreneurs and leaders among you.The cooperative differenceCooperatives are “businesses”. They are owned by their members, not by shareholders.  And while they are part of the business world and work within the market economy, they cannot be sold without their members’ consent. They focus on long-term growth and sustainable development, not on short-term profit and stock value.But most importantly, cooperatives are human-scale undertakings. They remain close to their communities. They are controlled by them. They bring members into the decision-making process, thus providing economic and democratic education in action. They support local and regional economies and encourage people to get involved to help themselves and to help their communities.Les coopératives : un rôle majeur dans l’économieBien qu’elles soient souvent peu connues du public et peu suivies par la presse financière, les coopératives jouent un rôle majeur dans l’économie mondiale. Elles comptent près d’un milliard de membres dans plus de 100 pays. Le chiffre d’affaires des 300 plus grosses coopératives au monde est de 1 600 milliards de dollars, soit l’équivalent du PIB canadien.Au Canada, il existe plus de 10 000 coopératives, qui appartiennent à 15 millions de membres. Parmi les plus connues, on retrouve le Mouvement Desjardins, Cooperators, Federated, Agropur, Mountain Equipment, Gay Lea Foods et même des équipes de football professionnel.Dans un contexte où les grandes tendances économiques et financières laissent de plus en plus de gens désabusés, désarmés, voire « déconnectés », le modèle coopératif fait partie des solutions dont nous devons tirer avantage.Les coopératives encouragent les personnes à participer et à agir, avec les autres, plutôt que d’attendre que la solution vienne de l’État. Elles permettent de « réengager » les personnes dans la société, parce qu’elles s’appuient sur la notion de l’« aide-toi toi-même », sur l’engagement personnel et sur la force de l’association. Les coopératives sont donc fondées sur l’exercice du leadership personnel et collectif. Elles permettent aux personnes de participer et de contribuer à leur entreprise collective.Commitment and self-helpBased on my own experience, I think that personal commitment and solidarity − which are the choices you make to play an active role in life rather than to remain passive − are also the most important ingredients of personal and collective success.As you are about to embark in a new stage of your life, I would like to give you one piece of advice. Get involved and commit yourself fully in whatever it is you are undertaking! Get engaged in your organizations and your communities.Le pouvoir et la volonté d’agirS’engager plutôt qu’être spectateur. Contribuer plutôt que critiquer. C’est ce pouvoir et cette volonté d’agir qui sont à la source de toutes les grandes réalisations du monde.C’est aussi ce pouvoir et cette volonté d’agir qui seront les clés de votre propre succès dans la vie, quelle que soit la voie que vous choisirez.Je souhaite donc à chacun et chacune de vous d’être des hommes et des femmes engagés auprès de vos proches et de votre communauté. Des leaders engagés au sein des entreprises publiques, privées ou coopératives que vous aurez créées ou pour lesquelles vous travaillerez.One of the most important roles of a leader is building trust. Because trust is what lets us work together, overcome challenges and beak new ground. Trust makes us seek out solidarity. To thrive and prosper, businesses and communities depend on the contribution of individuals driven by personal commitment and solidarity.So, I call on you to be the ones to go out and build that trust.Dans ce monde en transformation et en changement, nous devons tous apporter notre contribution et exercer notre leadership même si c’est parfois difficile. En pensant toujours au bien commun et en créant cette confiance, essentiels au développement des personnes et de la société.À chacun et chacune de vous je souhaite donc d’avoir cette conviction intime et  inébranlable que nous pouvons tous, un geste à la fois, contribuer à bâtir un monde meilleur.Merci encore à toute la communauté universitaire pour ce grand honneur que vous me faites aujourd’hui.Back to profile: Monique F. Leroux
