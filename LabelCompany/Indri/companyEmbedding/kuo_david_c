Dr Kuo
7/31/2005

C A.


                        Located on McDermott and Central, Dr Kuo is a great family practice doctor. His wife runs the front portion of the office and he is the only Dr. on staff there. Waiting time is normal (10-15 minutes) even sometimes with an appointment. I go there just for my regular exams and checkups and minors illnesses (flu once and bronchitis once). They are real good about fitting you in, like the time I had bronchitis and was leaving my job to go see them, they fit me in almost immediately.

Such a great experience. I came in with a sharp pain in my lower neck/upper back. Dr. Kuo really takes the time to explain to you why you're feeling pain and what treatments he's going to do. Week after week, he explains to you whether or now he feels that your muscles are less scarred, and you experience the pain is going away, which is amazing!

I love that you can ask Dr. Kuo any question about your condition, and he never makes you feel like your question is dumb.

So glad I stumbled across Dr. Kuo in my search for a chiropractor.







Dr. Kuo gets down to business and literally attacks your issues right away. I initially came in to get treated for my left ankle so that I could prance around Europe and Africa for 25 days. It was a stubborn injury I'd lived with for 3yrs that I didn't dedicate time to getting treated properly. I knew it would be an unpleasant trip spent hobbling around if I didn't get it fixed up beforehand. Well, guess what?! This girl walked all around Europe and Africa with no issues! I was even able to log 10mi in one day according to FitBit (yes, even after factoring in the time difference)! 

I also received treatment for the following persistent issues:
- Numbness in the left arm and 4th and 5th fingers (I feel stuff!)
- Left knee pain (I was able to run a 10K with knee taped!)
- Lower back pain (comes and goes)
- Neck pain (comes and goes)


Dr. Kuo was recommended to me by my brother and I would recommend him to others!! Everyone in the office is super nice, friendly, accommodating, and personable!







I've been to a few different chiropractors and most will just adjust you and do some stretches then you are done. Dr Kuo takes the time to explain everything he does which I really like. When I first saw him he asked for x-rays to really see what was going on in my neck, when we looked at the x-rays together he explained everything. The added plus is he is very close to where I teach







I came across Dr Kuo via Yelp after being badly rear-ended and the service I have received has been nothing short of excellent! 
His staff is warm, welcoming, and accommodating. Dr Kuo is genuinely invested in his clients, and his availability is awesome! He is very effective, efficient, and courteous. 
I would recommend Dr Kuo to my family and friends without a second thought!







Everything about Dr. Kuo's treatment is nothing short of amazing. He is the only medical professional I have ever encountered who doesn't make me feel as though he is rushing through my appointment to get to his next patient. His care is extremely personalized- he takes the time to address all issues and thoroughly answers any questions or concerns I may have at the end of each visit.  I have been seeing him for a little over a month now for what initially was excruciating neck and back pain, and I can honestly say that his treatment has really helped. His facilities are also very clean and well-kept. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!!!







Called in to do a quick treatment, the guy answered the phone say sure and they can take walk-in no problem, and then I said I just need a quick one time adjustment and nothing else, then he quickly got impatient, cut me off and said "you need appointment!" and hung up on me. Wish there's more I can add to this but that was exactly what happened, whole conversation was roughly 30 seconds long. He literally said, they can take walk-in no problem, then turned 180 and said I need appointment and hung me up. A+ customer service!







Awesome service, they really care about you and your pains. The secretary and the doctor were super friendly and welcoming. They welcome you with a big smile. Plus, if you arrive early to your appointment, they will take you (if time permits, of course). All in all, I would highly recommend.

P.s. Dr. Kuo helped me find directions to a place I wanted to go when I left my phone at home!!!







Dr David Kuo cares!!! He takes an excellent care of my lower back pain issues, as well as my wife's sciatica and TFL problems. Dr Kuo is very professional; he always treats us with great patience and 100% efforts. We strongly recommend Dr Kuo's chiropractic treatments!!!







Overall great experience. I probably would have spent a ton of $$ had I decided to go through my doctor rather than coming here. I am not the best at explaining things but  Dr. Kuo knew exactly what it was and diagnosed me with piriformis syndrome within minutes. He went into a detailed explanation of what it was and why I was experiencing the pain I was experiencing. The sessions were painful but they helped me tremendously. He showed me how to stretch the muscle and has sent videos explaining piriformis syndrome. Thank you!







Doctor David is best doctor I ever seen before. When I got lower back problem last year, I was really anxious and afraid of having treatment. However, my sister introduced David's clinic and David was patient to explain my back problem. He was so professional and you would know every detail about your problem. He also helped and encouraged me to do physical therapy step by step.  Before doing physical therapy, I felt relaxing because David would try to talk and make conversation with you. Right now, My lower back problem is better now after one year treatment.

I am really thank you for David's efforts. If you have similar problems like me, just go to David's clinic. He will help you solve it!







My body feels great after the adjustment, amazing service, and friendly. Recommend going here.







I was referred to Dr. Kuo by a co-worker after my car was rear-ended and I was experiencing pain in my neck and shoulders. Dr Kuo was able to diagnose the exact source of my pain and with a few months of treatment, I feel much better. In addition to that, Dr Kuo diagnosed other issues not related to the accident (i.e., DDD and 2 herniated discs in my lower back) that were causing major discomfort and headaches for which I am now getting treatment and notice marked improvement. Aside from the great technical expertise, Dr Kuo is extremely personable, genuine, caring and straightforward. It also helps that he has great taste in office music! The receptionist Angela is also super kind and helpful. Both Angela and Dr Kuo have been extremely accommodating and understanding with my sometimes last minute changes to appointments due to work or parenting responsibilities. I HIGHLY recommend Dr Kuo for your chiropractic needs!







Dr Kuo and his friendly staff provide professional and quality service.  Scheduling and wait room time is very efficient.  The physical office environment is modern and simple.  Dr. Kuo's knowledge, medical skills and bedside manners allow for progressive healing sessions.  After trying more than 6 chiropractors in the last few years, I have finally found an accessible doctor I trust and recommend.  Thank you, Dr Kuo!







Dr. Kuo's office is very friendly and professional. They understand and have big sympathy of patience's suffering, and provide the right treatment according to the issue. Dr. Kuo is very knowledgeable, patient and helpful. I have neck pain and shoulder pain, and the symptoms have been relieved a lot since I had treatment from Dr. Kuo.







I highly recommend seeing him if you need a chiropractor. Dr. Kuo may have an intimidating face but he's actually friendly and caring. He likes to ask about your life and what's new so it's never one of those awkward silent doctor visits. He has very good interpersonal skills. I see Dr. Kuo to prevent my scoliosis from worsening. He made me more anxious about my condition in the foreseeable future but at least I know I'm doing something about it while I'm still young. Aside from adjusting my spine, he has also instructed me to do some exercises at home to strengthen my back muscles.  I've also had hand treated after a major car accident. I wasn't able to put force on my hand for weeks so I asked him to look at it. He ended up cracking it back into place and it was fine again!! The process of pushing your muscles back into place may be extremely painful but well worth it. He also tends to my aging father and gives him tips beyond the scope of chiropractics to enhance his lifestyle.

Also, shout out to the receptionist, Winnie. She's very nice and puts on interesting shows/movies to watch on the big screen t.v. so you won't get bored in the waiting room. I also like how I get text notifications the day before my appointment so I never forget!







I did some research before I goes to Dr Kuo.  He is very patient and very knowledgeable, treats my pain completely, not just treating it locally, but finding out the causes and treats it completely.  The clinic is very clean and comfortable, Dr Kuo is a very friendly guy. Highly recommended.







Dr. Kuo is a nice doctor with awesome skill. He is very patient and careful. I suffer from my low back issue for long time ago. After I met Dr Kuo, my back is getting better and better. No doubt with his skill.







I have periformis syndrome and have gone to different chiropractors only to get adjusted and not target the problem. Dr. Kuo took time and worked with me focusing on my problem.  It was not a 5 minute office visit. His treatment gave me relief and I feel so much better. I highly recommend Dr. Kuo.  He is awesome.







Hands down, David is one of the best doctors I've had the pleasure of knowing!

I first went to see him in early 2015 because of lower back pain. He noticed I had a serious but treatable problem. I was very anxious and concerned but David was willing to take the time to explain why I had the condition as well as layout a course of treatment that fit my lifestyle and schedule, so all of my fears and anxieties were quickly relieved.

After several weeks of treatment we became friends. I really appreciated his willingness to spend extra time and personal attention, even with health issues outside the scope of my treatment. How many doctors will contact you by Facebook or text to make sure you're doing okay, or send you information that may be helpful.

It was because of David's attentiveness to my health that he was able to diagnose a unrelated problem which had been ailing me for a long time. And for this I will be forever grateful because I am able resume a lifestyle which I previously was no longer able to lead.

If you're looking for a doctor with experience and knows what he's talking about, can get the job done, and most importantly, CARES about his patients, David Kuo is the one you should see. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM to anyone I know.







I highly recommend seeing David for chiropractic services in the San Gabriel Valley area. He's very friendly and easy to communicate with. He is very knowledgeable and caring. He educates you on all sorts of exercises and facts about the issue on hand. He's truthful about whether or not a joint/bone problem can be fixed. Great doctor with great interpersonal skills. If I ever have any more joint/bone issues, I would drive the extra distance to see him.

I've been to a few different chiropractors and most will just adjust you and do some stretches then you are done. Dr Kuo takes the time to explain everything he does which I really like. When I first saw him he asked for x-rays to really see what was going on in my neck, when we looked at the x-rays together he explained everything. The added plus is he is very close to where I teach

I came across Dr Kuo via Yelp after being badly rear-ended and the service I have received has been nothing short of excellent! His staff is warm, welcoming, and accommodating. Dr Kuo is genuinely invested in his clients, and his availability is awesome! He is very effective, efficient, and courteous. I would recommend Dr Kuo to my family and friends without a second thought!

Everything about Dr. Kuo's treatment is nothing short of amazing. He is the only medical professional I have ever encountered who doesn't make me feel as though he is rushing through my appointment to get to his next patient. His care is extremely personalized- he takes the time to address all issues and thoroughly answers any questions or concerns I may have at the end of each visit.  I have been seeing him for a little over a month now for what initially was excruciating neck and back pain, and I can honestly say that his treatment has really helped. His facilities are also very clean and well-kept. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!!!

1 check-in
        


Called in to do a quick treatment, the guy answered the phone say sure and they can take walk-in no problem, and then I said I just need a quick one time adjustment and nothing else, then he quickly got impatient, cut me off and said "you need appointment!" and hung up on me. Wish there's more I can add to this but that was exactly what happened, whole conversation was roughly 30 seconds long. He literally said, they can take walk-in no problem, then turned 180 and said I need appointment and hung me up. A+ customer service!

Awesome service, they really care about you and your pains. The secretary and the doctor were super friendly and welcoming. They welcome you with a big smile. Plus, if you arrive early to your appointment, they will take you (if time permits, of course). All in all, I would highly recommend.P.s. Dr. Kuo helped me find directions to a place I wanted to go when I left my phone at home!!!

Overall great experience. I probably would have spent a ton of $$ had I decided to go through my doctor rather than coming here. I am not the best at explaining things but  Dr. Kuo knew exactly what it was and diagnosed me with piriformis syndrome within minutes. He went into a detailed explanation of what it was and why I was experiencing the pain I was experiencing. The sessions were painful but they helped me tremendously. He showed me how to stretch the muscle and has sent videos explaining piriformis syndrome. Thank you!

Doctor David is best doctor I ever seen before. When I got lower back problem last year, I was really anxious and afraid of having treatment. However, my sister introduced David's clinic and David was patient to explain my back problem. He was so professional and you would know every detail about your problem. He also helped and encouraged me to do physical therapy step by step.  Before doing physical therapy, I felt relaxing because David would try to talk and make conversation with you. Right now, My lower back problem is better now after one year treatment.I am really thank you for David's efforts. If you have similar problems like me, just go to David's clinic. He will help you solve it!

I was referred to Dr. Kuo by a co-worker after my car was rear-ended and I was experiencing pain in my neck and shoulders. Dr Kuo was able to diagnose the exact source of my pain and with a few months of treatment, I feel much better. In addition to that, Dr Kuo diagnosed other issues not related to the accident (i.e., DDD and 2 herniated discs in my lower back) that were causing major discomfort and headaches for which I am now getting treatment and notice marked improvement. Aside from the great technical expertise, Dr Kuo is extremely personable, genuine, caring and straightforward. It also helps that he has great taste in office music! The receptionist Angela is also super kind and helpful. Both Angela and Dr Kuo have been extremely accommodating and understanding with my sometimes last minute changes to appointments due to work or parenting responsibilities. I HIGHLY recommend Dr Kuo for your chiropractic needs!

Dr. Kuo is very knowledgeable, patient and helpful. I have neck pain and shoulder pain, and the symptoms have been relieved a lot since I had treatment from Dr. Kuo.

I highly recommend seeing him if you need a chiropractor. Dr. Kuo may have an intimidating face but he's actually friendly and caring. He likes to ask about your life and what's new so it's never one of those awkward silent doctor visits. He has very good interpersonal skills. I see Dr. Kuo to prevent my scoliosis from worsening. He made me more anxious about my condition in the foreseeable future but at least I know I'm doing something about it while I'm still young. Aside from adjusting my spine, he has also instructed me to do some exercises at home to strengthen my back muscles.  I've also had hand treated after a major car accident. I wasn't able to put force on my hand for weeks so I asked him to look at it. He ended up cracking it back into place and it was fine again!! The process of pushing your muscles back into place may be extremely painful but well worth it. He also tends to my aging father and gives him tips beyond the scope of chiropractics to enhance his lifestyle.Also, shout out to the receptionist, Winnie. She's very nice and puts on interesting shows/movies to watch on the big screen t.v. so you won't get bored in the waiting room. I also like how I get text notifications the day before my appointment so I never forget!

I have periformis syndrome and have gone to different chiropractors only to get adjusted and not target the problem. Dr. Kuo took time and worked with me focusing on my problem.  It was not a 5 minute office visit. His treatment gave me relief and I feel so much better. I highly recommend Dr. Kuo.  He is awesome.

Hands down, David is one of the best doctors I've had the pleasure of knowing!I first went to see him in early 2015 because of lower back pain. He noticed I had a serious but treatable problem. I was very anxious and concerned but David was willing to take the time to explain why I had the condition as well as layout a course of treatment that fit my lifestyle and schedule, so all of my fears and anxieties were quickly relieved.After several weeks of treatment we became friends. I really appreciated his willingness to spend extra time and personal attention, even with health issues outside the scope of my treatment. How many doctors will contact you by Facebook or text to make sure you're doing okay, or send you information that may be helpful.It was because of David's attentiveness to my health that he was able to diagnose a unrelated problem which had been ailing me for a long time. And for this I will be forever grateful because I am able resume a lifestyle which I previously was no longer able to lead.If you're looking for a doctor with experience and knows what he's talking about, can get the job done, and most importantly, CARES about his patients, David Kuo is the one you should see. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM to anyone I know.

I highly recommend seeing David for chiropractic services in the San Gabriel Valley area. He's very friendly and easy to communicate with. He is very knowledgeable and caring. He educates you on all sorts of exercises and facts about the issue on hand. He's truthful about whether or not a joint/bone problem can be fixed. Great doctor with great interpersonal skills. If I ever have any more joint/bone issues, I would drive the extra distance to see him.

            Business Owner
        





            Dr. David Kuo graduated from McGill University and Southern California University of Health and Science.   Due to a life altering personal experience following a low back injury with severe, crippling pain, Dr. Kuo became determined to learn as much as possible about this type of injury and how to help people with similar problems. Dr. Kuo is a dedicated doctor determined to provide the highest quality of care to people who are injured or in pain. Helping people in distress is a personal challenge and passion for him. He believes in the human body's natural capacity to heal itself with proper guidance. When he's not treating patients, he enjoys basketball, track and field, and Tae Kwon Do. He is also a classically trained violinist. Dr. Kuo has a strong belief in family and his relationship with God guides him in all aspects of his life.

Such a great experience. I came in with a sharp pain in my lower neck/upper back. Dr. Kuo really takes the time to explain to you why you're feeling pain and what treatments he's going to do. Week after week, he explains to you whether or now he feels that your muscles are less scarred, and you experience the pain is going away, which is amazing!

I love that you can ask Dr. Kuo any question about your condition, and he never makes you feel like your question is dumb.

So glad I stumbled across Dr. Kuo in my search for a chiropractor.







Dr. Kuo gets down to business and literally attacks your issues right away. I initially came in to get treated for my left ankle so that I could prance around Europe and Africa for 25 days. It was a stubborn injury I'd lived with for 3yrs that I didn't dedicate time to getting treated properly. I knew it would be an unpleasant trip spent hobbling around if I didn't get it fixed up beforehand. Well, guess what?! This girl walked all around Europe and Africa with no issues! I was even able to log 10mi in one day according to FitBit (yes, even after factoring in the time difference)! 

I also received treatment for the following persistent issues:
- Numbness in the left arm and 4th and 5th fingers (I feel stuff!)
- Left knee pain (I was able to run a 10K with knee taped!)
- Lower back pain (comes and goes)
- Neck pain (comes and goes)


Dr. Kuo was recommended to me by my brother and I would recommend him to others!! Everyone in the office is super nice, friendly, accommodating, and personable!







I've been to a few different chiropractors and most will just adjust you and do some stretches then you are done. Dr Kuo takes the time to explain everything he does which I really like. When I first saw him he asked for x-rays to really see what was going on in my neck, when we looked at the x-rays together he explained everything. The added plus is he is very close to where I teach







I came across Dr Kuo via Yelp after being badly rear-ended and the service I have received has been nothing short of excellent! 
His staff is warm, welcoming, and accommodating. Dr Kuo is genuinely invested in his clients, and his availability is awesome! He is very effective, efficient, and courteous. 
I would recommend Dr Kuo to my family and friends without a second thought!







Everything about Dr. Kuo's treatment is nothing short of amazing. He is the only medical professional I have ever encountered who doesn't make me feel as though he is rushing through my appointment to get to his next patient. His care is extremely personalized- he takes the time to address all issues and thoroughly answers any questions or concerns I may have at the end of each visit.  I have been seeing him for a little over a month now for what initially was excruciating neck and back pain, and I can honestly say that his treatment has really helped. His facilities are also very clean and well-kept. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!!!







Called in to do a quick treatment, the guy answered the phone say sure and they can take walk-in no problem, and then I said I just need a quick one time adjustment and nothing else, then he quickly got impatient, cut me off and said "you need appointment!" and hung up on me. Wish there's more I can add to this but that was exactly what happened, whole conversation was roughly 30 seconds long. He literally said, they can take walk-in no problem, then turned 180 and said I need appointment and hung me up. A+ customer service!







Awesome service, they really care about you and your pains. The secretary and the doctor were super friendly and welcoming. They welcome you with a big smile. Plus, if you arrive early to your appointment, they will take you (if time permits, of course). All in all, I would highly recommend.

P.s. Dr. Kuo helped me find directions to a place I wanted to go when I left my phone at home!!!







Dr David Kuo cares!!! He takes an excellent care of my lower back pain issues, as well as my wife's sciatica and TFL problems. Dr Kuo is very professional; he always treats us with great patience and 100% efforts. We strongly recommend Dr Kuo's chiropractic treatments!!!







Overall great experience. I probably would have spent a ton of $$ had I decided to go through my doctor rather than coming here. I am not the best at explaining things but  Dr. Kuo knew exactly what it was and diagnosed me with piriformis syndrome within minutes. He went into a detailed explanation of what it was and why I was experiencing the pain I was experiencing. The sessions were painful but they helped me tremendously. He showed me how to stretch the muscle and has sent videos explaining piriformis syndrome. Thank you!







Doctor David is best doctor I ever seen before. When I got lower back problem last year, I was really anxious and afraid of having treatment. However, my sister introduced David's clinic and David was patient to explain my back problem. He was so professional and you would know every detail about your problem. He also helped and encouraged me to do physical therapy step by step.  Before doing physical therapy, I felt relaxing because David would try to talk and make conversation with you. Right now, My lower back problem is better now after one year treatment.

I am really thank you for David's efforts. If you have similar problems like me, just go to David's clinic. He will help you solve it!







My body feels great after the adjustment, amazing service, and friendly. Recommend going here.







I was referred to Dr. Kuo by a co-worker after my car was rear-ended and I was experiencing pain in my neck and shoulders. Dr Kuo was able to diagnose the exact source of my pain and with a few months of treatment, I feel much better. In addition to that, Dr Kuo diagnosed other issues not related to the accident (i.e., DDD and 2 herniated discs in my lower back) that were causing major discomfort and headaches for which I am now getting treatment and notice marked improvement. Aside from the great technical expertise, Dr Kuo is extremely personable, genuine, caring and straightforward. It also helps that he has great taste in office music! The receptionist Angela is also super kind and helpful. Both Angela and Dr Kuo have been extremely accommodating and understanding with my sometimes last minute changes to appointments due to work or parenting responsibilities. I HIGHLY recommend Dr Kuo for your chiropractic needs!







Dr Kuo and his friendly staff provide professional and quality service.  Scheduling and wait room time is very efficient.  The physical office environment is modern and simple.  Dr. Kuo's knowledge, medical skills and bedside manners allow for progressive healing sessions.  After trying more than 6 chiropractors in the last few years, I have finally found an accessible doctor I trust and recommend.  Thank you, Dr Kuo!







Dr. Kuo's office is very friendly and professional. They understand and have big sympathy of patience's suffering, and provide the right treatment according to the issue. Dr. Kuo is very knowledgeable, patient and helpful. I have neck pain and shoulder pain, and the symptoms have been relieved a lot since I had treatment from Dr. Kuo.







I highly recommend seeing him if you need a chiropractor. Dr. Kuo may have an intimidating face but he's actually friendly and caring. He likes to ask about your life and what's new so it's never one of those awkward silent doctor visits. He has very good interpersonal skills. I see Dr. Kuo to prevent my scoliosis from worsening. He made me more anxious about my condition in the foreseeable future but at least I know I'm doing something about it while I'm still young. Aside from adjusting my spine, he has also instructed me to do some exercises at home to strengthen my back muscles.  I've also had hand treated after a major car accident. I wasn't able to put force on my hand for weeks so I asked him to look at it. He ended up cracking it back into place and it was fine again!! The process of pushing your muscles back into place may be extremely painful but well worth it. He also tends to my aging father and gives him tips beyond the scope of chiropractics to enhance his lifestyle.

Also, shout out to the receptionist, Winnie. She's very nice and puts on interesting shows/movies to watch on the big screen t.v. so you won't get bored in the waiting room. I also like how I get text notifications the day before my appointment so I never forget!







I did some research before I goes to Dr Kuo.  He is very patient and very knowledgeable, treats my pain completely, not just treating it locally, but finding out the causes and treats it completely.  The clinic is very clean and comfortable, Dr Kuo is a very friendly guy. Highly recommended.







Dr. Kuo is a nice doctor with awesome skill. He is very patient and careful. I suffer from my low back issue for long time ago. After I met Dr Kuo, my back is getting better and better. No doubt with his skill.







I have periformis syndrome and have gone to different chiropractors only to get adjusted and not target the problem. Dr. Kuo took time and worked with me focusing on my problem.  It was not a 5 minute office visit. His treatment gave me relief and I feel so much better. I highly recommend Dr. Kuo.  He is awesome.







Hands down, David is one of the best doctors I've had the pleasure of knowing!

I first went to see him in early 2015 because of lower back pain. He noticed I had a serious but treatable problem. I was very anxious and concerned but David was willing to take the time to explain why I had the condition as well as layout a course of treatment that fit my lifestyle and schedule, so all of my fears and anxieties were quickly relieved.

After several weeks of treatment we became friends. I really appreciated his willingness to spend extra time and personal attention, even with health issues outside the scope of my treatment. How many doctors will contact you by Facebook or text to make sure you're doing okay, or send you information that may be helpful.

It was because of David's attentiveness to my health that he was able to diagnose a unrelated problem which had been ailing me for a long time. And for this I will be forever grateful because I am able resume a lifestyle which I previously was no longer able to lead.

If you're looking for a doctor with experience and knows what he's talking about, can get the job done, and most importantly, CARES about his patients, David Kuo is the one you should see. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM to anyone I know.







I highly recommend seeing David for chiropractic services in the San Gabriel Valley area. He's very friendly and easy to communicate with. He is very knowledgeable and caring. He educates you on all sorts of exercises and facts about the issue on hand. He's truthful about whether or not a joint/bone problem can be fixed. Great doctor with great interpersonal skills. If I ever have any more joint/bone issues, I would drive the extra distance to see him.

Such a great experience. I came in with a sharp pain in my lower neck/upper back. Dr. Kuo really takes the time to explain to you why you're feeling pain and what treatments he's going to do. Week after week, he explains to you whether or now he feels that your muscles are less scarred, and you experience the pain is going away, which is amazing!I love that you can ask Dr. Kuo any question about your condition, and he never makes you feel like your question is dumb.So glad I stumbled across Dr. Kuo in my search for a chiropractor.

Dr. Kuo gets down to business and literally attacks your issues right away. I initially came in to get treated for my left ankle so that I could prance around Europe and Africa for 25 days. It was a stubborn injury I'd lived with for 3yrs that I didn't dedicate time to getting treated properly. I knew it would be an unpleasant trip spent hobbling around if I didn't get it fixed up beforehand. Well, guess what?! This girl walked all around Europe and Africa with no issues! I was even able to log 10mi in one day according to FitBit (yes, even after factoring in the time difference)! I also received treatment for the following persistent issues:- Numbness in the left arm and 4th and 5th fingers (I feel stuff!)- Left knee pain (I was able to run a 10K with knee taped!)- Lower back pain (comes and goes)- Neck pain (comes and goes)Dr. Kuo was recommended to me by my brother and I would recommend him to others!! Everyone in the office is super nice, friendly, accommodating, and personable!

I've been to a few different chiropractors and most will just adjust you and do some stretches then you are done. Dr Kuo takes the time to explain everything he does which I really like. When I first saw him he asked for x-rays to really see what was going on in my neck, when we looked at the x-rays together he explained everything. The added plus is he is very close to where I teach

I came across Dr Kuo via Yelp after being badly rear-ended and the service I have received has been nothing short of excellent! His staff is warm, welcoming, and accommodating. Dr Kuo is genuinely invested in his clients, and his availability is awesome! He is very effective, efficient, and courteous. I would recommend Dr Kuo to my family and friends without a second thought!

Everything about Dr. Kuo's treatment is nothing short of amazing. He is the only medical professional I have ever encountered who doesn't make me feel as though he is rushing through my appointment to get to his next patient. His care is extremely personalized- he takes the time to address all issues and thoroughly answers any questions or concerns I may have at the end of each visit.  I have been seeing him for a little over a month now for what initially was excruciating neck and back pain, and I can honestly say that his treatment has really helped. His facilities are also very clean and well-kept. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!!!

Called in to do a quick treatment, the guy answered the phone say sure and they can take walk-in no problem, and then I said I just need a quick one time adjustment and nothing else, then he quickly got impatient, cut me off and said "you need appointment!" and hung up on me. Wish there's more I can add to this but that was exactly what happened, whole conversation was roughly 30 seconds long. He literally said, they can take walk-in no problem, then turned 180 and said I need appointment and hung me up. A+ customer service!

Plus, if you arrive early to your appointment, they will take you (if time permits, of course). All in all, I would highly recommend.P.s. Dr. Kuo helped me find directions to a place I wanted to go when I left my phone at home!!!

Overall great experience. I probably would have spent a ton of $$ had I decided to go through my doctor rather than coming here. I am not the best at explaining things but  Dr. Kuo knew exactly what it was and diagnosed me with piriformis syndrome within minutes. He went into a detailed explanation of what it was and why I was experiencing the pain I was experiencing. The sessions were painful but they helped me tremendously. He showed me how to stretch the muscle and has sent videos explaining piriformis syndrome. Thank you!

Doctor David is best doctor I ever seen before. When I got lower back problem last year, I was really anxious and afraid of having treatment. However, my sister introduced David's clinic and David was patient to explain my back problem. He was so professional and you would know every detail about your problem. He also helped and encouraged me to do physical therapy step by step.  Before doing physical therapy, I felt relaxing because David would try to talk and make conversation with you. Right now, My lower back problem is better now after one year treatment.I am really thank you for David's efforts. If you have similar problems like me, just go to David's clinic. He will help you solve it!

I was referred to Dr. Kuo by a co-worker after my car was rear-ended and I was experiencing pain in my neck and shoulders. Dr Kuo was able to diagnose the exact source of my pain and with a few months of treatment, I feel much better. In addition to that, Dr Kuo diagnosed other issues not related to the accident (i.e., DDD and 2 herniated discs in my lower back) that were causing major discomfort and headaches for which I am now getting treatment and notice marked improvement. Aside from the great technical expertise, Dr Kuo is extremely personable, genuine, caring and straightforward. It also helps that he has great taste in office music! The receptionist Angela is also super kind and helpful. Both Angela and Dr Kuo have been extremely accommodating and understanding with my sometimes last minute changes to appointments due to work or parenting responsibilities. I HIGHLY recommend Dr Kuo for your chiropractic needs!

I highly recommend seeing him if you need a chiropractor. Dr. Kuo may have an intimidating face but he's actually friendly and caring. He likes to ask about your life and what's new so it's never one of those awkward silent doctor visits. He has very good interpersonal skills. I see Dr. Kuo to prevent my scoliosis from worsening. He made me more anxious about my condition in the foreseeable future but at least I know I'm doing something about it while I'm still young. Aside from adjusting my spine, he has also instructed me to do some exercises at home to strengthen my back muscles.  I've also had hand treated after a major car accident. I wasn't able to put force on my hand for weeks so I asked him to look at it. He ended up cracking it back into place and it was fine again!! The process of pushing your muscles back into place may be extremely painful but well worth it. He also tends to my aging father and gives him tips beyond the scope of chiropractics to enhance his lifestyle.Also, shout out to the receptionist, Winnie. She's very nice and puts on interesting shows/movies to watch on the big screen t.v. so you won't get bored in the waiting room. I also like how I get text notifications the day before my appointment so I never forget!

I have periformis syndrome and have gone to different chiropractors only to get adjusted and not target the problem. Dr. Kuo took time and worked with me focusing on my problem.  It was not a 5 minute office visit. His treatment gave me relief and I feel so much better. I highly recommend Dr. Kuo.  He is awesome.

Hands down, David is one of the best doctors I've had the pleasure of knowing!I first went to see him in early 2015 because of lower back pain. He noticed I had a serious but treatable problem. I was very anxious and concerned but David was willing to take the time to explain why I had the condition as well as layout a course of treatment that fit my lifestyle and schedule, so all of my fears and anxieties were quickly relieved.After several weeks of treatment we became friends. I really appreciated his willingness to spend extra time and personal attention, even with health issues outside the scope of my treatment. How many doctors will contact you by Facebook or text to make sure you're doing okay, or send you information that may be helpful.It was because of David's attentiveness to my health that he was able to diagnose a unrelated problem which had been ailing me for a long time. And for this I will be forever grateful because I am able resume a lifestyle which I previously was no longer able to lead.If you're looking for a doctor with experience and knows what he's talking about, can get the job done, and most importantly, CARES about his patients, David Kuo is the one you should see. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM to anyone I know.

I highly recommend seeing David for chiropractic services in the San Gabriel Valley area. He's very friendly and easy to communicate with. He is very knowledgeable and caring. He educates you on all sorts of exercises and facts about the issue on hand. He's truthful about whether or not a joint/bone problem can be fixed. Great doctor with great interpersonal skills. If I ever have any more joint/bone issues, I would drive the extra distance to see him.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. David Kuo has the following 6 areas of expertise and  1 specialty.                     General Practice
    A general practitioner is similar to a family practitioner in that they treat patients of all ages with a variety of health concerns. These doctors treat everyday ailments, some acute and chronic diseases, and also provid health checkups, physicals, inoculations and preventative care.


    General practitioners differ from family practitioners because they are not required to complete an additional residency in family medicine after completing their medical school residency. Like family practitioners, general practitioners will also provide referrals to patients who are in need of a specialist.
