Read this important information
Performance represents average annual total returns, assumes the reinvestment of all distributions and reflects applicable sales charges. Total returns reflect a waiver of part of each Fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.

Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.

Additional disclosures
Returns prior to the first offering of a specific share class of a Fund are based on the previous performance of other share classes of that Fund as noted below. This performance is substantially similar to what the specific share class would have produced because all share classes of a Fund invest in the same portfolio of securities. Performance assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. Performance has not been adjusted to reflect differences in applicable sales charges for individual classes, which if reflected may have resulted in higher or lower performance for the specific share class. Performance has been adjusted to reflect different expense levels for individual classes.

Morningstar Ratings disclosure
Morningstar Ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance. The Morningstar RatingTM is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with the Fund's 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) periods.
Morningstar Ratings metrics. Morningstar Ratings are based solely on a proprietary mathematical formula based on measures of risk and performance that it recalculates each month. The ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's or ETF’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) emphasizing downward variations and rewarding consistency. Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.
Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Current fund performance may be higher or lower, which may change a fund’s star rating. Despite high ratings, funds may have experienced negative performance during the period. Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.
Ratings (with load) reflect class-specific sales charges, if any. A class share ratings no longer reflect sales charges. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.

Geneva Capital Management 












Consistent philosophy and process since 1987
Geneva Capital Management is a US growth equity manager specializing in high quality growth strategies including Large Cap, All Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap US growth equities. Geneva was founded more than 30 years ago on the belief that a dedicated and professional investment team committed to a high quality investment strategy would generate superior risk adjusted returns over a market cycle.
The investment process at Geneva begins with fundamental analysis to identify high quality companies with superior management teams, low leverage, and a consistent, sustainable record of growth. New ideas for the portfolio are sourced through management contact, quantitative screens and various other sources. In our opinion, qualitative characteristics are as important as quantitative characteristics. Therefore, we focus on identifying passionate, innovative and experienced management teams with a proven record of success. These companies are leaders in their industry and must also possess a sustainable competitive advantage that will support above average growth going forward. Quantitative screens are used to eliminate companies that do not meet our defined criteria.
In October 2014, Henderson Global Investors acquired Geneva Capital Management, and subsequently merged with Janus Capital Group on May 30, 2017, to form Janus Henderson Investors. As a subsidiary of Janus Henderson Investors, Geneva continues to employ the same rigorous investment philosophy and process that has been in place since 1987.
Aligned goals
Geneva offers clients access to a vast pool of investment experience. With 125 years of accumulated industry background, members of our Investment Team have successfully weathered a wide range of market conditions. We continue to utilize a team approach in everything we do, placing a high value on the contributions of all team members and structuring the team to optimize diversity of experience, perspective and opinions.
As Geneva’s portfolio managers have a significant amount of their own capital invested in their strategies, the managers’ goals are directly aligned with those of clients. We have historically been invested in our own strategies because we believe our high quality focus is the best way to build wealth over time. In other words, these are the kinds of companies we personally want to be invested in: they are leaders in their industries, have long term sustainable competitive advantages and typically offer excellent visibility and predictability.
We believe our success over many years can be attributed to our proven investment philosophy, disciplined approach to portfolio management, attention to client service and our dedicated team approach. We are invested alongside our clients through our investment strategies, closely aligning our goals with those of our clients.
