shares of Common Stock. BRCM, as the investment advisor and general partner of BPOF, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,200,000
shares of Common Stock directly owned by BPOF.

shares of Common Stock.
 
Accordingly, as of the date hereof, BRF as the parent
company of BRC and BRCM may be deemed to beneficially own the aggregate of 1,529,269 shares of Common Stock.
 
The foregoing should not be construed as an admission
by any Reporting Person as to beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock owned by another Reporting Person. Each of the
Reporting Persons disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock that are not directly owned by such Reporting Person,
except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein.
 

(b)Percent of class:
 
The aggregate percentage of Shares reported owned by
each Reporting Person is based upon 27,430,677 shares of Common Stock as reported in the Issuer’s Prospectus Supplement,
filed with the SEC on June 28, 2017, as the number of shares outstanding after the underwriter exercises its option to purchase
additional shares in full.
 
As of the date hereof, BPOF directly owned approximately
4.37% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. By virtue of their relationships described above in Item 4(a), each of BRCM may
be deemed to beneficially own approximately 4.37% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, which are directly owned by BPOF.
