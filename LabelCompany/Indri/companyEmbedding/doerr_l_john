Early life[edit]
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. He obtained a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.[4]
Career[edit]
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel's most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices.[5][6]
He joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1980 and since then, has directed venture capital funding to some of the most successful technology companies in the world including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.[7]
Doerr has backed some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.
Venture funding[edit]
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California's Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono's ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]

Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

Early life[edit]
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. He obtained a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.[4]
Career[edit]
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel's most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices.[5][6]
He joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1980 and since then, has directed venture capital funding to some of the most successful technology companies in the world including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.[7]
Doerr has backed some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.
Venture funding[edit]
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California's Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono's ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]
References[edit]


^ Info about John Doerr's degrees from Rice -- including, notably, the fact that his "Master's" degree from Rice is an M.EE, not an M.S. degree -- was obtained from the Rice alumni "online directory" (accessed June 18, 2017). Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]

^ Info about John Doerr's degrees from Rice -- including, notably, the fact that his "Master's" degree from Rice is an M.EE, not an M.S. degree -- was obtained from the Rice alumni "online directory" (accessed June 18, 2017). Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

Early life[edit]
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. He obtained a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.[4]
Career[edit]
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel's most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices.[5][6]
He joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1980 and since then, has directed venture capital funding to some of the most successful technology companies in the world including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.[7]
Doerr has backed some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.
Venture funding[edit]
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California's Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono's ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]
References[edit]


^ Info about John Doerr's degrees from Rice -- including, notably, the fact that his "Master's" degree from Rice is an M.EE, not an M.S. degree -- was obtained from the Rice alumni "online directory" (accessed June 18, 2017). Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

I am deeply indebted to several people – especially Robert Carr, Bill Campbell, Randy Komisar, and John Doerr – who gave freely of their time to describe these scenes.

Austria, which was originally home to a Celtic people, was conquered by the  Roman Empire in about 15 BC. Following the fall of Rome,  Austria was repeatedly invaded by barbarian tribes, such as the Vandals,  Visigoths, and Huns, who swept in from the east. During the 5th and 6th centuries, the Alemanni, Avars and Slavs settled  Austria. The Avars were defeated in 785 by the Frankish emperor  Charlemagne, who set up the East Mark, which later became known as the �sterreich.  Austria was ruled by the Babenburger dynasty until 1278, when they were succeeded by the Hapsburg dynasty, which ruled  Austria until the 20th century.

    Buy PDF History »The surname Doerr was first found in  Austria, where the name could be considered to have made a major contribution to the  feudal society which became the backbone of early development of Europe. The name became prominent in  local affairs and branched into many houses in  Austria and  Germany which played important roles in the savage tribal and national conflicts, each group supremacy in a changing territorial profile.Doerr Spelling VariationsDoerr Spelling VariationsMany cultural groups lived in the German states in medieval times. Each had its own dialect and traditions, and unique variations of popular names. Low German, which is similar to contemporary Dutch, was spoken in  Westphalia. German names are characterized by additions such as regional suffixes and phrases that tell something about the origin or background of its original bearer. Further contributing to the variation in German names was the fact that there were no spelling rules in medieval times: scribes recorded names according to their sound. The recorded  spelling variations of Doerr include Dorr, Doerr, Dor, Doer, Dorrs, Dors, Dorrer, Doerrer, Deorrie and many more.Doerr Early HistoryDoerr Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Doerr research.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Early life[edit]
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. He obtained a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.[4]
Career[edit]
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel's most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices.[5][6]
He joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1980 and since then, has directed venture capital funding to some of the most successful technology companies in the world including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.[7]
Doerr has backed some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.
Venture funding[edit]
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California's Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono's ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]
References[edit]


^ Info about John Doerr's degrees from Rice -- including, notably, the fact that his "Master's" degree from Rice is an M.EE, not an M.S. degree -- was obtained from the Rice alumni "online directory" (accessed June 18, 2017). Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

Early life[edit]
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. He obtained a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.[4]
Career[edit]
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel's most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices.[5][6]
He joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1980 and since then, has directed venture capital funding to some of the most successful technology companies in the world including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.[7]
Doerr has backed some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.
Venture funding[edit]
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California's Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono's ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]

^ Info about John Doerr's degrees from Rice -- including, notably, the fact that his "Master's" degree from Rice is an M.EE, not an M.S. degree -- was obtained from the Rice alumni "online directory" (accessed June 18, 2017). Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

Early life[edit]
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. He obtained a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.[4]
Career[edit]
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel's most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices.[5][6]
He joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1980 and since then, has directed venture capital funding to some of the most successful technology companies in the world including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.[7]
Doerr has backed some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.
Venture funding[edit]
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California's Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono's ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on Forbes magazine's exclusive "Midas List" and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.[8]
Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change, and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter's remark: "your generation created this problem, you better fix it" as a call to fight global warming.[9]
In 2008 he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone "more important than the personal computer" because "it knows who you are" and "where you are." In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund's value by another $100 million, making iFund the worlds biggest investment pool in cell phone application industry.[10] He currently serves on the boards of Google, Amyris Biotech, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins's $150 million investment in Twitter.[11][12]
In 2013 he invested in DreamBox[13][14] which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company, Remind.
Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[15] Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.[16]
Economic Recovery Advisory Board[edit]
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America's economic downturn.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California with their children.[19]
In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.[20][21]
Awards[edit]
In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business.[22]
In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.[23][24][25]
In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.
Politics[edit]
In April 2013, a lobbying group called FWD.us (aimed at lobbying for immigration reform and improvements to education) was launched, with John Doerr listed as one of the founders. Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for them on several occasions.[26]
References[edit]


^ Info about John Doerr's degrees from Rice -- including, notably, the fact that his "Master's" degree from Rice is an M.EE, not an M.S. degree -- was obtained from the Rice alumni "online directory" (accessed June 18, 2017). Comment: Finding such information using the Rice alumni "online directory" did require a password (at least, on [as of] June 18, 2017); however, since John Doerr (together with his wife) is "also" among the major donors to Rice, [perhaps the largest ever, since William Marsh Rice], -- see, e.g., this press release -- the information may well be publicly available some other way; e.g. to (and/or from) information providers such as Forbes magazine, which has featured John Doerr on its cover at least once in the past.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The next wave of the Web is going to be user-generated content.
John Doerr


Wave,
Content,
Going



















People are looking to have more meaning in their lives. It is a sign the technology community is coming of age.
John Doerr


Age,
Technology,
Community
























It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass, and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here.
John Doerr


Water,
Stupid,
Sorry



















Well, there are more writers of blogs right now than there are readers, so that's clearly a vanity phenomenon.
John Doerr


Vanity,
More,
Now



















We all know about blogs and how big they are.
John Doerr


Know,
Big,
How



















They've found a way to privately, or within a small family group, share expressions, or other images, drawings, and then gain access to some of the world's great expressions and images and make them real, make them tangible.
John Doerr

Great,
World



















There's this large trend - I think the next trend in the Web, sort of Web 2.0 - which is to have users really express, offer, and market their own content, their own persona, their identity.
John Doerr


Identity,
Think,
Content



















It's actually not unlike Google at that stage of development. They had an up-and-running site. It wasn't losing very much money, it wasn't making very much money, but it was growing.
John Doerr


Money,
Losing,
Google



















It is quite clear that compelling content, which is made available on economic terms that respect the intellectual rights of owners, can be a tremendous spur to the growth of broadband networks.
John Doerr


Respect,
Growth,
Content
























Green-tech could be the largest economic opportunity of the 21st Century.
John Doerr


Opportunity,
Environmental



















Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that's better living through bugs.
John Doerr


Living,
Eating,
Better



















Green technologies - going green - is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.
John Doerr


Opportunity,
Green,
Internet
