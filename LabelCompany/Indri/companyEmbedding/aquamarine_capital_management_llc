Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

 OUR MOVEMENT
BEYOND CONFLICT DIAMONDS











 Our Beyond Conflict Free Diamonds 


Our mission is to cultivate a more ethical, transparent, and sustainable jewelry industry. We hold true to our values of awareness and transparency by carefully tracking our diamonds' origins. We go beyond the usual standard to offer diamonds that originate from ethical and environmentally responsible sources.










Our mission is to cultivate a more ethical, transparent, and sustainable jewelry industry. We hold true to our values of awareness and transparency by carefully tracking our diamonds' origins. We go beyond the usual standard to offer diamonds that originate from ethical and environmentally responsible sources.



What Sets Us Apart

Jewelers that offer “conflict free” diamonds are limiting themselves to the Kimberley Process’s definition, which narrowly defines conflict diamonds as diamonds that finance rebel movements against recognized governments. What this definition leaves out is large numbers of diamonds that are tainted by violence, human rights abuses, poverty, and environmental degradation.
Brilliant Earth goes above and beyond the current industry standards to offer diamonds that originate from pure, ethical sources.  We also offer lab created and recycled diamonds, both of which are eco-friendly alternatives.
Our ethically sourced natural diamonds originate from mines that follow strict labor, trade, and environmental standards. Our diamonds are traceable to their origins and demonstrate a robust chain of custody. Learn more about our traceable diamond origins.

 CANADA



Our Canadian diamonds originate from the Diavik and Ekati mines, which meet rigorous environmental standards and are held accountable to independent environmental monitoring agencies.
Both mines have demonstrated a strong commitment to hiring local Aboriginal people, providing a skilled apprenticeship program and improving the average income and unemployment rate.
The Diavik mine was voted as one of Canada’s top 100 employers due to their dedication to community development programs and the health, safety, and welfare of their employees.

 RUSSIA



Russian diamonds from the Yakutia region of northeast Siberia provide thousands of jobs to local residents. Workers earn double the average Russian salary and receive affordable housing, health care, and pensions. Although diamond mines have altered the physical landscape in some places and Russia’s geopolitical role is controversial, the overall effect of diamond mining has been positive for local communities. The diamond industry in Yakutia funds hospitals, cultural centers, and other public works.

 ×
 Namibia



Our Namibian diamonds help provide local jobs with fair wages, safe working conditions, and skilled job training.
Diamonds are mined in line with strict international ecological standards while on-shore mining areas are watched over by the Coastal Monitoring Program.
Revenue from diamonds contributes to Namibia’s economy, providing investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
READ MORE













 ×
 Botswana



Botswana diamonds provide local employees with fair wages and safe working conditions. Injuries to miners are rare and occur at even lower rates than at mines in the United States and Australia. Environmental monitoring promotes sustainability and protects the ecosystem of the Kalahari Desert.
Diamond revenue accounts for a third of Botswana’s economy, promoting national prosperity and high per capita incomes. This enables investments in universal primary education, a national university, infrastructure, and health care.

×
South Africa


South African diamonds come from mines that contribute to local communities and act as responsible stewards of the environment.
Diamonds from South Africa provide quality jobs and generate revenue for investments in local businesses. Employee health is a priority. Mines have taken a leadership role in combatting high rates of HIV and tuberculosis in the country.
South African mines have put in place comprehensive environmental management plans. To reduce their carbon footprint, mines have invested in solar projects and wind farms. 
READ MORE











×
Lab Created


Some of our lab created diamonds are grown in the United States. Lab created diamonds are a naturally eco-friendly choice, since they require no mining. They are grown in highly controlled laboratory environments using technological processes that mimic the conditions under which diamonds naturally develop in the earth's crust. Lab diamonds have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds.
READ MORE











×
Recycled


Recycled diamonds are repurposed from secondary sources, which means they are an eco-friendly choice as they require no mining. This, in effect, decreases the demand for newly mined diamonds. Recycled diamonds are independently verified to demonstrate their high quality.

Our Values



   

Protecting Human Rights
We are committed to offering diamonds that are untouched by human rights abuses, including child labor, forced labor, murder, torture, and rape.



   

Improving Livelihoods
Our natural diamonds are mined in alignment with fair trade principles, providing local jobs, fair wages, and safe and progressive working conditions.



   

Empowering Communities
Ethical origin diamonds promote long term economic development by investing in education and health care.



   

Protecting the Environment
Our diamonds are sourced to international environmental standards to protect local ecosystems and minimize environmental degradation.



   

Traceability
Our diamonds are traceable to their origins and demonstrate a robust chain of custody.

Aquamarine
Aquamarine is best known for its breathtaking range of blue colors and belongs to the same family as emerald (beryl). The name derives from the Latin expression for seawater. Aquamarine is colored by trace amounts of iron that find their way into the crystal structure. A dark blue is the most desired color. Aquamarine possesses a durable hardness (7.5-8 on the Mohs scale), which qualifies it for any kind of jewelry.The favored cuts are emerald (step) and brilliant cut with long or rectangular shapes. Turbid stones get a cabochon cut.Aquamarine is a decorative gem that complements almost any skin or eye color, which makes it an all-time favorite for women the world over. It is a popular gem, universal to wear, readily available and moderately priced, but growing in popularity. Aquamarine is the birthstone for March.
Green blue aquamarine beryl is indeed one of the most classic blue gemstone types  frequently used in gemstone rings. Aquamarine is also very-well suited for all other types of gemstone jewelry too, including gemstone earrings, pins and brooches, as well as in necklaces and fashionable gemstone pendants.
