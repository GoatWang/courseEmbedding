“The best interest of the client is the only interest that matters. - Larry W. Carroll, CFP®”

With this simple approach to financial planning, Larry Carroll established Carroll Financial Associates in 1980. The firm currently manages or supervises over $2.4 billion in advisory and brokerage assets and employs 21 CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® practitioners.
Over the years, Carroll Financial has grown into a large independent financial planning and investment management firm, but that core philosophy has never changed. Our focus is the same today as it was in 1980 - we are committed to our clients’ best interests.
Larry provides investment management and retirement income planning for retirees and pre-retirees throughout the Carolinas. He believes that managing money for retirees is more about controlling risk than about maximizing returns. For most of his clients, the primary goal is making sure that they can receive an income from their assets for the rest of their lives.
 
“I think our clients find comfort in the fact that while they will only retire once, we’ve been through the process many times.”  - Larry W. Carroll, CFP®
 
Larry’s devotion to his clients has earned him national recognition in the financial planning profession. Some of his many accomplishments include:

Forbes’ list of America’s Top 200 Wealth Advisors
Worth magazine’s listing of “The Nation’s Most Exclusive Wealth Managers” twelve times
All of Barron’s annual lists of “The Top Financial Advisors”
Past president of the International Association of Financial Planners (IAFP), predecessor to the Financial Planning Association (FPA)

Quoted in Money, Newsweek, The New York Times, Medical Economics, The Wall Street Journal, BusinessWeek, US News and World Report, American Banker and other financial publications, Larry has also appeared on CNBC Street Signs and the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.
Larry serves on the board of Park Sterling Bank and Capitala Finance Corporation, both publically traded companies, and has previously served on the boards of other community banks and educational institutions.
Larry shares his passion for philanthropy and learning with Vivian, his wife of over 40 years. Together they are actively involved in many local charities and universities, including: YMCA of Greater Charlotte, American Red Cross, Hospice and Palliative Care Charlotte Region, Austin Peay State University, Winthrop University and The University of Tennessee.
In 2011, Larry received the Tower Award from Winthrop University. He was also inducted into the Sigma Beta Delta Business Honor Society from Austin Peay State University and the State of Tennessee Legacy Society for his philanthropic efforts.  In 2016, he received the Alumni Professional Achievement Award from the University of Tennessee.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

               CHM aims to provide a safe and healthy environment for all volunteers. If a volunteer is injured in the course of the volunteer's service, it is important that the volunteer notify his or her supervisor immediately. Volunteers should also complete an incident report and submit the report to the volunteer's supervisor. CHM's general liability coverage, with some limitations and exclusions, protects volunteer workers for covered injury or damage those results from activities or service that volunteers conduct or perform at CHM's direction and within the scope of their duties for CHM. CHM's general liability coverage does not provide coverage to volunteers themselves for liabilities they may have incurred for their actions. CHM's volunteer accident insurance coverage covers some injuries to volunteers while volunteers are performing volunteer service on behalf of CHM. In some instances, volunteers must sign a release absolving CHM of liability when CHM volunteers voluntarily and knowingly subject themselves to certain risks while performing volunteer services on behalf of CHM.

Larry Carroll


Nationality
American


Citizenship
United States


Occupation
Artist


Larry Carroll is a former television news reporter in Los Angeles, and an artist who has worked for The Progressive, The Village Voice, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, The Nation, Reason, Spin, Ray Gun, and other periodicals drawing political illustrations.[1] Carroll's most notable work is designing the artwork for the American thrash metal band Slayer's album covers.
Carroll designed the artwork for Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss and Christ Illusion. Reign in Blood's release was delayed due to the controversial cover art,[1] though it placed in the "top 10 heavy metal album covers of all time" by Blender.[2] Christ Illusion was banned in India for its graphic art depicting Christ mutilated with missing limbs, in a sea of blood with severed heads.[3]
