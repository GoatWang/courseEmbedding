	         In particular, the relief requested in this application (the "




	Application




	") would allow ARCC, the Ivy Hill Funds, the
	CoLTS Funds, FirstLight, KB-07, the Emporia Funds, the PDS Funds, Ares Capital CP Funding LLC, Ares Capital JB Funding LLC and any other investment fund that ARCC (or any
	entity directly or indirectly controlled by ARCC within the meaning of Section 2(a)(9)) may in the future sponsor or provide investment management services to, as well as any other
	vehicles

	5

	that currently exist or may be established in the future that may co-invest therewith or make an investment in lieu thereof for tax, legal or regulatory purposes to
	effect transactions with or on behalf of a Downstream Managed Fund (collectively, the "




	Future Downstream Managed Funds




	" and, together with the Ivy Hill
	Funds, the CoLTS Funds, FirstLight, KB-07, the Emporia Funds, the PDS Funds, Ares Capital CP Funding LLC and Ares Capital JB Funding LLC, the
	"




	Downstream Managed Funds





	6

	," and the Downstream Managed Funds together with ARCC, the "




	ARCC
	Funds




	"), on the one hand, and the Existing Affiliated Funds, and any current or future entities that Ares Management, ACM or an affiliated person (as defined in
	Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act ("




	Affiliate




	")) (other than Ivy Hill or any other investment manager that ARCC may in the future directly or
	indirectly control) of either may in the future sponsor or provide investment management services to, as well as any other vehicles

	7

	that currently exist or may be established in the
	future that may invest on a side-by-side basis therewith or make an investment in lieu thereof for tax, legal or regulatory purposes to effect financing transactions with or on
	behalf of an Affiliated Fund (each a "




	Future Affiliated Fund




	" and together with the Existing Affiliated Funds, the "




	Affiliated
	Funds




	"), on the other hand, to co-invest in the same investment opportunities where such investment would otherwise be prohibited under the Act. As used herein
	"




	Co-Investment Transaction




	" means any transaction in which an ARCC Fund participates together with an Affiliated Fund in reliance on the
	Order, and includes, in the case of any such transaction to which a Downstream Managed Fund managed by Ivy Hill is a party, any sharing of Covered Information

	8

	by Ivy Hill in connection
	therewith. "




	Potential Co-Investment Transaction




	" means any investment opportunity in which an ARCC Fund could not participate together with an
	Affiliated Fund without obtaining and relying on the Order, and includes, in the case of any such investment opportunity to which a Downstream Managed Fund managed by Ivy Hill is a party, any sharing
	of Covered Information by Ivy Hill in connection therewith. The relief requested in this Application would also allow ARCC Funds to participate in Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint
	Exit Transactions (both as defined below) with Affiliated Funds.




	         All
	existing entities that currently intend to rely on the Order have been named as Applicants and any existing or future entities that may rely on the Order in the future will comply
	with its terms and conditions.







	   





	         

	5

	  In
	certain cases a Downstream Managed Fund's constituent documents will provide the flexibility for the formation of a special purpose vehicle to invest side
	by side with a Downstream Managed Fund. These special purpose vehicles are generally formed because they are necessary or desirable from a tax, legal, accounting or regulatory perspective (for
	example, to address tax issues that a non-U.S. investor has in a fund that are not shared by other domestic investors in ARCC), or to facilitate participation in certain types of
	investments (for example, subsidiary corporations may be used to address tax issues that result from investing in a pass-through entity like a partnership or a limited liability company).
	ARCC and the Downstream Managed Funds utilize wholly owned subsidiaries to hold interests in certain of their portfolio companies (the "




	ARCC SPVs




	"). All
	of the ARCC SPVs are wholly owned by ARCC, either directly or indirectly, and, therefore, qualify for the exclusion from the definition of the term investment company pursuant to
	Section 3(c)(7). The ARCC SPVs ordinarily are structured as Delaware corporations and hold certain investment assets that are structured as pass-through tax entities (such as
	partnership interests or limited liability company interests) in order to allow ARCC to continue to qualify as a RIC for tax purposes. The ARCC SPVs are a method of tax planning frequently used by
	companies that have elected to be treated as RICs. Relief for the ARCC SPVs is necessary as they will also be directly or indirectly controlled and managed by ARCC (or an entity directly or indirectly
	controlled by ARCC within the meaning of Section 2(a)(9)) and may co-invest with the Affiliated Funds, which are persons described in Section 57(b)(2) of the Act.




	         

	6

	  All
	Downstream Managed Funds are or will be downstream affiliates of ARCC that are or will be covered by Rule 57b-1.




	         

	7

	  The
	information set forth in footnote 5 above regarding ARCC SPVs also applies for the special purpose vehicles established by Existing Affiliated Funds.
	Relief for these vehicles is necessary as they will be controlled by Ares Management and may co-invest with the ARCC Funds, which are persons described in Section 57(b)(2) of the
	Act.




	         

	8

	  "




	Covered Information




	" means all information directly or indirectly provided by Ivy Hill to ACM or any person
	affiliated with ACM (other than ARCC) except information that: (i) is generally available to the public; (ii) is of the nature that Ivy Hill (including members of its investment
	committee with respect to Covered Information received in their capacities as such) and any persons controlled by Ivy Hill. ("




	Information Providers




	")
	share with unaffiliated market participants at no cost and is not proprietary to the Information Providers; (iii) Information Providers have obtained from unaffiliated third parties, including
	but not limited to general market opinions and analyses, analyst reports and diligence reports, and that such third parties generally make available to others, including market participants in the
	ordinary course, at no cost; or (iv) Information Providers have obtained from, or are providing on behalf of, borrowers or potential borrowers or their advisors, and that such borrowers or
	advisors generally make available to unaffiliated market participants at no cost upon request.

	 Floor, New York, NY 10167. In connection with its initial public offering, ARCC filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File
	No. 333-114656) under the Securities Act of 1933. ARCC completed an initial public offering of its common stock, par value $0.001, on October 8, 2004, and has raised
	additional capital through subsequent equity offerings from time to time.




	        ARCC's
	investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. ARCC invests primarily in U.S. middle market companies, where
	it believes the supply of primary capital is limited and investment opportunities are most attractive. ARCC invests primarily in first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt, which in some
	cases includes an equity component like warrants. To a lesser extent, ARCC makes equity investments. In addition, ARCC has the ability to provide "one stop" financing with the ability to invest
	capital across the balance sheet and hold larger investments than many of its competitors. The ability to underwrite, syndicate, and hold larger investments benefits ARCC's shareholders by:
	(i) increasing originated deal
	flow flexibility, (ii) potentially increasing net income to ARCC and earnings for ARCC through syndication, (iii) broadening market relationships and deal flow, (iv) allowing ARCC
	to optimize its portfolio composition and (v) allowing ARCC to provide capital to middle market companies, which ARCC believes currently have limited access to capital from traditional lending
	sources.




	        ARCC's
	business and affairs are managed under the direction of a board of directors (the "




	Board




	"). The Board currently consists of nine
	members, five of whom are not "interested persons" of ARCC as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Act (the "




	Independent Directors




	"). The Board has
	delegated daily management and investment authority to ACM pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement (the "




	Investment Advisory
	Agreement




	"). Ares Operations LLC ("




	Ares Administration




	") serves as ARCC's administrator pursuant to an administration
	agreement (the "




	Administration Agreement




	").





	B.    IVY HILL AND THE DOWNSTREAM MANAGED FUNDS





	        ARCC's indirect wholly owned portfolio company that manages the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Downstream Managed Funds, is Ivy Hill, a Delaware
	limited partnership. Ivy Hill registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "




	Advisers Act




	") on March 30, 2012.

	  Section 2(a)(48)
	defines a BDC to be any closed-end investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments in securities
	described in Section 55(a)(1) through 55(a)(3) of the Act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities.

	  On
	March 30, 2012, the Commission issued an order exempting ARCC from the provisions of Section 12(d)(3) to permit ARCC to continue to own and
	make additional investments in Ivy Hill. Release No. IC-30024 (Mar. 30, 2012) (order); Release No. IC-29977 (Mar. 9, 2012) (notice).

	        Ares
	Capital CP Funding LLC and Ares Capital JB Funding LLC are consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company that were formed in October 2004 and December 2011,
	respectively.




	        Ivy
	Hill I and Ivy Hill II are unconsolidated middle market credit funds. Ivy Hill I primarily invests in first and second lien bank debt of middle market companies.




	        On
	November 5, 2008, Ivy Hill II was established to invest primarily in first and second lien and subordinated bank debt of middle market companies.




	        In
	March 2010, Ivy Hill acquired Allied Capital Corporation's management rights in respect of, and interests in, Knightsbridge CLO 2008-1 Ltd.
	("




	KB 2008




	"). KB 2008 invested primarily in first lien and second lien bank debt of middle market companies. In December 2011, KB 2008 closed a
	refinancing transaction pursuant to which, among other things, KB 2008 was renamed Ivy Hill Middle Market Credit Fund III, Ltd.




	        In
	December 2009, Ivy Hill acquired Allied Capital Corporation's management rights in respect of, and interests in, the Allied Capital Senior Debt Fund, L.P. (now referred to as
	Ivy Hill Senior Debt Fund, L.P. or "




	Ivy Hill SDF




	"), for approximately $33 million in cash. In connection with such acquisition, Ivy Hill
	also acquired Allied Capital Corporation's management rights in respect of, and interests in, Ivy Hill Senior Debt Funding 2007-1 and Ivy Hill Senior Debt Fund, Ltd., which also
	invest, either directly or indirectly, primarily in first lien loans and, to a lesser extent, second lien loans of middle-market companies.




	        Ivy
	Hill SDF is a Delaware limited partnership and the other Ivy Hill Funds are Cayman Islands exempted companies with limited liability ("




	Cayman
	Companies




	").




	        The
	CoLTS Funds are also Cayman Companies and are managed by Ivy Hill pursuant to sub-management agreements with each CoLTS Fund's respective manager. Each CoLTS Fund invests
	in the debt and debt securities of middle market companies.




	        FirstLight
	is also a Cayman Company managed by Ivy Hill pursuant to a sub-management agreement with FirstLight's collateral manager. FirstLight invests in debt and debt
	securities of primarily middle market companies.




	        In
	March 2010, Ivy Hill acquired Allied Capital Corporation's management rights in respect of, and equity interests in, KB-07. KB-07 is a Cayman Company.




	        On
	April 1, 2010, ARCC completed its previously announced acquisition of Allied Capital Corporation. In connection with the acquisition, A.C. Corp., the manager of the Emporia
	Funds, became a wholly owned subsidiary of ARCC. The Emporia Funds are Cayman Companies. In November 2010, the management rights in respect of the Emporia Funds were assigned to Ivy Hill.




	        In
	the fourth quarter of 2010, the PDS Funds were established to invest in indebtedness of middle market companies. The PDS Funds are both Delaware limited partnerships.




	        The
	Downstream Managed Funds all rely on Section 3(c)(7) for an exclusion from regulation under the Act. As of March 31, 2012, Ivy Hill had total committed capital under
	management of over $3.4 billion, which included approximately $0.3 billion committed by ARCC.





	C.    ARES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC AND ARES ADMINISTRATION LLC





	        ACM, a Delaware limited liability company that is registered under the Advisers Act, serves as the investment adviser to ARCC pursuant to the Investment Advisory
	Agreement. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, ACM manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to, ARCC. Under
	the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, ACM determines the composition of ARCC's portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to ARCC's portfolio and the manner of implementing such

	II.

	RELIEF REQUESTED








	A.    CO-INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS





	        1.     

	Mechanics
	of Co-Investment Transactions





	        The
	Board believes that ARCC's investment adviser, ACM, is able to leverage the current investment platform, resources and existing relationships of Ares Management and its affiliated
	companies (collectively, "




	Ares




	") to provide ARCC with attractive investment opportunities. Due to the size of the Ares platform and the sheer number of
	investment opportunities presented to it, ACM could never be certain that it has been offered the opportunity to review



	every



	Potential
	Co-Investment Transaction merely considered by an Affiliated Fund. However, ACM and each investment manager to a Downstream Managed Fund (ACM and each investment manager, each, an
	"




	Adviser




	") will be notified of all Potential Co-Investment Transactions across the Ares platform that have been formally presented in
	writing to the investment committees of an Affiliated Fund that fit within the Objectives and Strategies

	11

	of the ARCC Fund that the Adviser manages.




	        When
	an Adviser is notified of a Potential Co-Investment Transaction in the manner described above, the Adviser will independently analyze and evaluate the investment
	opportunity as to its appropriateness for the ARCC Fund. In the case of ARCC, after ACM considers ARCC's investment objective and strategies, available funds, market conditions, regulatory
	requirements and other pertinent factors particular to ARCC (including applicable investment restrictions and the amount ARCC can invest in such investment), if it determines that the opportunity is
	appropriate for ARCC and an Affiliated Fund has also confirmed its desire to participate, ACM will forward the opportunity to the Board for consideration.

	12








	   





	        

	11

	  "




	Objectives and Strategies




	" means, solely for the purposes of this Order (i) in the case of ARCC,
	ARCC's investment objectives and strategies, as defined by the Board, including a Required Majority of the Board, from time to time using objective criteria and (ii) in the case of a Downstream
	Managed Fund, such Downstream Managed Fund's objectives and strategies as defined by such Downstream Managed Fund's investment adviser from time to time using objective criteria.




	        

	12

	  For
	purposes of this Application, approval by the Board will be effected by the unanimous approval of a Co-Investment Approval Committee, which
	will consist of a required majority as defined in Section 57(o) (a "




	Required Majority




	") of the directors eligible to vote on the
	Co-Investment Transaction under Section 57(o) (the "




	Eligible Directors




	") (i.e., the Co-Investment Approval
	Committee is a committee comprised solely of ARCC's Independent Directors representing (i) a majority of the Independent Directors of ARCC and (ii) a majority of members of the Board who
	have no financial interest in such Co-Investment Transaction).




	10










	        With
	respect to Downstream Managed Funds, their respective investment managers will independently analyze and evaluate each investment opportunity referred to them by an Affiliated Fund.
	In connection with a Co-Investment Transaction between an Affiliated Fund, on the one hand, and a Downstream Managed Fund, on the other hand, the constituent documents for each of the
	Downstream Managed Funds require some form of independent approval of the transaction. Thus, each Downstream Managed Fund has a transaction committee or an advisory committee with at least one member
	who is not affiliated with any ARCC Fund or Affiliated Fund or who is an individual (otherwise unaffiliated with the Downstream Managed Fund or Ares generally) engaged by the Downstream Managed Fund
	solely for the purpose of providing an independent role (an "




	Independent Party




	") to approve or reject transactions with affiliated entities. All
	Co-Investment Transactions between a Downstream Managed Fund and an Affiliated Fund must be approved by the Downstream Managed Fund's Independent Party. For example, a
	Co-Investment Transaction between Ivy Hill I, on the one hand, and an Affiliated Fund, on the other hand, would require the approval of Ivy Hill I's Independent Party, i.e., the
	transaction committee of Ivy Hill I's board of directors, which includes the independent members of that board. Thus, in such Co-Investment Transaction, if the applicable Adviser
	determines that the opportunity is appropriate for the Downstream Managed Fund and an Affiliated Fund has confirmed its desire to also participate, the investment manager will forward the opportunity
	to the Downstream Managed Fund's Independent Party for consideration.




	        Determinations
	regarding when an ARCC Fund or an Affiliated Fund will invest in a particular Potential Co-Investment Transaction are made solely by the specific fund's
	Adviser (or investment committee thereof), and then submitted for approval by the Board or an Independent Party, as applicable, in accordance with the conditions in this application. While the members
	of the various investment committees for the Affiliated Funds and the ARCC Funds may overlap in part, no investment committee of a fund makes investment decisions for another fund.




	        All
	other subsequent activity (i.e., exits from or additional investments in a portfolio company, consisting of a debt or equity investment or warrants, or the exercise of
	conversion privileges or other similar rights to acquire additional securities of the issuer (any such additional investment, a "




	Follow-On
	Investment




	")) in respect of an investment acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
	Application. In particular, the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, of each ARCC Fund that relies on the Order will either pre-approve that ARCC Fund's use of pro rata dispositions
	and Follow-On Investments as a procedure (in which case such disposition or Follow-On Investment does not need to be submitted to the ARCC Fund's Eligible Directors or
	Independent Party, as applicable) or, if the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, does not so pre-approve the use of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as a
	procedure, then all dispositions and Follow-On Investments, including pro-rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, will be submitted to the ARCC Fund's Eligible
	Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, for approval. The Board or Independent Party, as applicable, of any ARCC Fund may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its
	approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors or
	Independent Party as applicable.




	        2.     

	Reasons
	for Co-Investment Transactions





	        ARCC,
	the Downstream Managed Funds, Ares CSF II, Ares CSF III and Ares Mezzanine Partners, L.P. are currently the only investment vehicles sponsored by Ares
	Management or ACM that focus primarily on investments in illiquid first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt in U.S. private companies. ACM's services to ARCC under the Investment Advisory
	Agreement are not exclusive and, accordingly, it and its affiliates may, consistent with its applicable fiduciary duties, furnish similar services to other entities, including entities with investment
	objectives similar to ARCC's investment objective.




	11










	        Though
	the primary investment focus of the ARCC Funds is currently different from that of the Affiliated Funds (other than Ares CSF II and Ares CSF III, which primarily
	make secondary purchases of senior and mezzanine debt of middle market companies, Ares Mezzanine Partners, L.P., which primarily makes investments in mezzanine debt and equity of middle market
	companies, and ACE, which primarily originates loans to non-U.S. companies), there nonetheless may be investment opportunities appropriate for, and that meet the investment objectives of,
	both an ARCC Fund and one or more of the Affiliated Funds. For example, while the Existing Affiliated Funds (other than Ares CSF II, Ares CSF III, Ares Mezzanine Partners, L.P.
	and ACE) that acquire debt primarily acquire syndicated or liquid debt, they may, on occasion, acquire illiquid debt in private companies. The ability to co-invest with Affiliated Funds
	would give ARCC more opportunities to provide capital to middle market companies, which ARCC believes currently have limited access to capital from traditional lending sources. Depending on prevailing
	market conditions, it would also result in increased income to ARCC, a wider universe of investment opportunities and a greater ability to structure deal terms that are favorable to ARCC. All of these
	benefits would, in turn, enhance value for ARCC's shareholders.




	        Indeed,
	ARCC's inability to co-invest with the Existing Affiliated Funds has in the past and, absent the issuance of the requested Order, will continue to in the future
	result in the loss of beneficial investment opportunities for ARCC and, in turn, adversely affect ARCC's shareholders. For example, the amount of ARCC's available capital, diversification requirements
	imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and other factors may preclude ARCC from providing to a borrower the entire amount of financing being sought by such borrower. While the
	investment opportunity may be one in which it is appropriate for one or more Affiliated Funds to participate (in which case such Affiliated Funds could fill the "gap" in ARCC's financing
	capabilities), absent the
	issuance of the requested Order, such participation would not be an option and ARCC would, as a result, lose the investment opportunity.




	        Current
	credit market conditions have led to a decline in the availability of capital, thereby creating more opportunities for ARCC to make investments consistent with its investment
	objective and allowing ARCC to focus on transactions where its competitive advantages are strongest. The ability to commit larger amounts of financing to portfolio companies in a
	Co-Investment Transaction would give ARCC greater flexibility to make larger financing commitments, which would, among other things, increase income to ARCC. In addition, increasing the
	opportunities available to ARCC with a co-investment structure would generate greater deal flow, broaden the market relationships of ARCC and allow ARCC to be more selective in choosing
	its investments so that ARCC can pursue the most attractive risk-adjusted investments and optimize its portfolio. Enhanced selectivity and more favorable deal terms, pricing and structure
	would also likely lead to closer relationships between portfolio companies and ARCC. All of these benefits would, in turn, enhance value for ARCC's shareholders.




	        In
	addition to deal flow, the Ares investment platform assists ACM in analyzing, structuring and monitoring investments. Ares' senior principals have worked together for over
	12 years and have an average of over 20 years experience investing in senior loans, high yield bonds, mezzanine debt and private equity securities. ARCC has access to the Ares staff of
	more than 225 investment professionals and to more than 250 administrative professionals who provide assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations. The
	ability to co-invest with the Affiliated Funds on the terms and conditions outlined in this Application would give ARCC the opportunity to more effectively leverage these resources and
	greater flexibility to pursue attractive investments that would otherwise have been unavailable to ARCC. This will benefit ARCC's shareholders while ensuring that any such co-investment
	transactions are "consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act" and provide for participation by ARCC not "on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other
	participants."




	        Ares
	Management and its controlled Affiliates that manage the Affiliated Funds are exposed to a large number of investment opportunities that could potentially be appropriate for and
	attractive to




	12










	ARCC.
	Applicants believe that if ARCC were able to co-invest with the Affiliated Funds to the extent contemplated in this Application, ARCC could access potentially accretive investment
	opportunities that would not otherwise be available to it. In such cases, ACM would independently analyze the suitability of such potential investment vis-à-vis
	ARCC's investment objective and the state of its investment portfolio at that time. Based on such analyses (performed separately for each such investment proposal), ACM would determine which
	opportunities are consistent with ARCC's investment objective and present such opportunities for the consideration of the Board in accordance with the terms of this Application.




	        In
	addition, ACM will present to the Board, on a quarterly basis, a record of any investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions consummated by any Affiliated Funds
	during the preceding quarter that fell within ARCC's then-current Objectives and Strategies and were formally presented in writing to the investment committees of such Affiliated Funds
	that were not made available to ARCC, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not made available to ARCC.




	        ARCC
	believes it is appropriate to have the Board set the Objectives and Strategies related to asset class, minimum return, liquidity and size of investment as well as any control or
	management rights available to ARCC in connection with this reporting requirement and in connection with the process of referring Potential Co-Investment Transactions, as discussed above.
	Investment vehicles that are not subject to any leverage restrictions (like most of the Affiliated Funds) can pursue a lower return than what ARCC generally pursues given its leverage restrictions.
	The Affiliated Funds may also pursue investments with more liquidity, of a larger size or with less control over the portfolio company than ARCC generally pursues given its investment objective and
	BDC status. As discussed, co-investment is in the best interests of shareholders of ARCC, and defining specific parameters for these purposes ensures that the Board will be able to focus
	only on those opportunities in which ARCC may actually choose to invest instead of being overwhelmed by information relating to other opportunities that would not (or could not) otherwise be pursued
	by ARCC. Such parameters may change over time as markets and ARCC's available capital change as well as in light of a variety of other factors, and as a result ARCC believes that, for purposes of
	referrals and the reporting requirement, the Board should revisit such parameters from time to time, depending on market conditions, ARCC's available capital and a variety of other factors.




	        The
	same rationale supporting ARCC's participation in Co-Investment Transactions also applies to participation by the Downstream Managed Funds in Co-Investment
	Transactions. Although the Downstream Managed Funds ordinarily will not have boards of directors in the traditional corporate sense or as contemplated under the Act, each Downstream Managed Fund has
	an Independent Party that will perform the same type of analyses and make the same types of determinations regarding a prospective Co-Investment Transaction as the Board would perform
	under the circumstances indicated above.

	B.    JOINT FOLLOW-ON TRANSACTIONS AND JOINT EXIT TRANSACTIONS





	        1.     

	Mechanics.





	As
	a result of the expansion of the business of Ares and ARCC, there may be instances where an ARCC Fund and Affiliated Fund find themselves holding securities in the same portfolio company of the
	same or a different class, but where the respective acquisitions of those securities did not occur at the same time or otherwise implicate the joint transaction proscriptions of
	Section 57(a)(4). In these scenarios, no issue arose under Section 57 when the original investments were made, and it is possible that either or both funds may exit the investment or
	complete a Follow-On Investment, also without implicating Section 57(a), in which case relief of the type being sought in this Application would not be required. If, however, either
	the ARCC Fund or the Affiliated Fund wishes to exit the investment, or make a Follow-On Investment in that portfolio company, and Section 57(a)(4) is implicated (those situations
	where Section 57(a)(4) was not implicated when the initial investments were made, but where Section 57(a)(4) is implicated in connection with the exit from, or additional acquisition of,
	such investment are referred to as "




	Joint Exit Transactions




	" and "




	Joint Follow-On
	Transactions




	," respectively), the procedures set forth in the conditions must be followed to ensure fairness.




	        2.     

	Ensuring
	Fairness in Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions.





	        Upon
	issuance of the requested Order, Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions may arise as described above. In connection with Joint Follow-On
	Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions, the protocols set forth in the conditions are designed to ensure the fairness of those transactions to the participating ARCC Funds.




	        The
	conditions contribute to the fairness of Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions by eliminating the ability of the Affiliated Funds to participate in
	those transactions on a basis that is more advantageous than the participation of the ARCC Funds. Thus, by requiring, among other things, that such transactions are completed at the same time (except
	that the settlement date for an Affiliated Fund in a Joint Follow-On Transaction may occur up to seven days after the settlement date for an ARCC Fund, and vice-versa), for the
	same price and other terms, or are approved by the Board or the Independent Party of an ARCC Fund, as applicable and as required by the conditions, the opportunity for overreaching by the Affiliated
	Funds vis-à-vis the ARCC Funds is eliminated.




	        3.     

	Rationale
	for Joint Exit and Joint Follow-On Transactions





	        As
	described above, an ARCC Fund and an Affiliated Fund may find themselves holding investments in the same portfolio company of the same or a different class, but where the respective
	acquisitions of those investments did not implicate the joint transaction proscriptions of Section 57(a)(4), and therefore the investments were not made through a Co-Investment
	Transaction. As the Co-Investment Transaction model is not implicated in these situations, a question arises as to how to ensure that an exit from or a Follow-On Investment in
	a portfolio company in this situation is made on terms that are fair and equitable and do not harm ARCC's shareholders or a Downstream Fund's interest holders, as applicable.




	        A
	method for exiting and for completing Follow-On Investments in the described situation may be necessary because at times it will be in the best interests of the
	shareholders of ARCC and the interest holders of the Downstream Managed Funds to be able to exit from, and complete Follow-On Investments in, investments when an Affiliated Fund holds a
	different investment in the same issuer and the different investments were acquired under circumstances that did not implicate Section 57(a)(4). If the respective funds are not able to exit
	such investments or complete Follow-On Investments in respect of such investments, then the respective funds may be forced to hold an investment when it is no longer viewed as potentially
	accretive (in the case of exits) or when more attractive investment opportunities are available (in the case of Follow-On Investments).




	14










	        With
	respect to Joint Follow-On Transactions, Applicants believe that the conditions set forth herein will provide appropriate protection to ARCC's shareholders. The fact
	that the Joint
	Follow-On Transaction would be effected at a time when the ARCC Fund and the Affiliated Fund already have respective positions in the portfolio company would seem to be ably addressed by
	the requirement that the Board, or the Independent Party of a Downstream Managed Fund, as applicable, make certain findings regarding the fact that the proposed Joint Follow-On Transaction
	is in the best interests of ARCC's shareholders or a Downstream Managed Fund's interest holders, as applicable.




	        With
	respect to Joint Exit Transactions, Applicants see no basis to impose greater restrictions than those that would be imposed under the traditional co-investment order
	templates. There will be times when it will be in the best interests of ARCC's shareholders, or a Downstream Managed Fund's interest holders, for the ARCC Fund to divest of a position also held by an
	Affiliated Fund. Assuming, as Applicants do here, that the ARCC Fund and the Affiliated Fund came to and have maintained their respective positions in the portfolio company separately
	(i.e., Section 57(a)(4) has not been implicated in their circumstances prior to seeking the disposition in question), the layering of additional conditions to a disposition would serve
	no shareholder protection or policy purpose. Stated differently, the fact that the various conditions typically imposed on the acquisition side of a co-investment program were not
	applicable to the disjointed acquisitions here should not impact or change the analysis. Those conditions have historically been imposed to ensure that investments made under circumstances which
	Congress in Section 57(a)(4) identified as presumptively abusivei.e., where a BDC and an affiliate are acting jointly by investing in the same issuer in some concerted
	waywere the subject of a protocol designed to prevent the abuse through specific limitations and proactive board involvement, as appropriate. Where, as here, no such presumptively abusive
	transaction has occurred as a predicate, imposition of the conditions would seem to gratuitously impose a burden for a problem that does not exist. As a result, Applicants believe that applying
	conditions to the exit or Follow-On Investment, as applicable, itself, but not adding any other additional conditions, appropriately protects the interests of ARCC's shareholders and the
	Downstream Managed Funds' interest holders.





	C.    APPLICABLE LAW





	        1.     

	Sections 57(a)(4)
	and 57(i) of the Act, and Rule 17d-1 thereunder.





	Section 57(a)(4)
	makes it unlawful for any person who is related to a BDC in a manner described in Section 57(b), acting as principal, knowingly to effect any transaction in which the
	BDC is a joint or a joint and several participant with that person in contravention of rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by
	the BDC on a basis less advantageous than that of the other participant. Although the Commission has not adopted any rules expressly under Section 57(a)(4), Section 57(i) provides that
	the rules under Section 17(d) applicable to registered closed-end investment companies (e.g., Rule 17d-1) are, in the interim, deemed to apply to
	transactions subject to Section 57(a). Rule 17d-1, as made applicable to BDCs by Section 57(i), prohibits any person who is related to a BDC in a manner described in
	Section 57(b), as modified by Rule 57b-1, from acting as principal, from
	participating in, or effecting any transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the BDC is a participant, unless an application
	regarding the joint enterprise, arrangement, or profit-sharing plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted by an order entered prior to the submission of the plan or any modification
	thereof, to security holders for approval, or prior to its adoption or modification if not so submitted.




	        In
	passing upon applications under Rule 17d-1, the Commission will consider whether the participation by the BDC in such joint transaction is consistent with the
	provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.




	15










	        2.     

	Section 57(b)
	of the Act and Rule 57b-1 thereunder.





	        Section 57(b),
	as modified by Rule 57b-1, specifies the persons to whom the prohibitions of Section 57(a)(4) apply. These persons include the following:
	(1) any director, officer, employee, or member of an advisory board of a BDC or any person (other than the BDC itself) who is, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C), an affiliated
	person of any such person; or (2) any investment adviser or promoter of, general partner in, principal underwriter for, or person directly or indirectly either controlling, controlled by, or
	under common control with a BDC (except the BDC itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the BDC, would not be directly or indirectly under the control of a
	person who controls the BDC), or any person who is, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C) or (D) an affiliated person of such person.




	        Rule 57b-1
	under the Act exempts certain persons otherwise related to a BDC in a manner described in Section 57(b)(2) of the Act from being subject to the
	prohibitions of Section 57(a). Specifically, this rule states that the provisions of Section 57(a) shall not apply to any person: (a) solely because that person is directly or
	indirectly controlled by a BDC, or (b) solely because that person is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a person described in (a) of the rule
	or is an officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of a person described in (a) of the rule.




	        Section 2(a)(9)
	defines "control" as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an
	official position with such company. The statute also sets forth the interpretation that any person who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than
	25 percent of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed to control such company; any person who does not so own more than
	25 percent of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed not to control such company; and a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person.




	        Sections 2(a)(3)(C)
	and (D) define an "affiliated person" of another person as: "(C) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control
	with, such other person; (D) any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such other person."





	D.    NEED FOR RELIEF





	        Co-Investment Transactions, Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions would be prohibited by Section 57(a)(4) and
	Rule 17d-1 without a prior exemptive order of the Commission to the extent that the Affiliated Funds fall within the category of persons described by Section 57(b), as
	modified by Rule 57b-1 thereunder. The ARCC Funds and each of the Affiliated Funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) by reason of
	common control because (i) Ares Management or controlled Affiliates of Ares Management manage each of the Affiliated Funds, (ii) Ares Management controls ACM, which manages ARCC pursuant
	to the Investment Advisory Agreement and (iii) currently certain of the Downstream Managed Funds are managed by, and pay advisory fees to, Ivy Hill, and now certain of the Downstream Managed
	Funds are, and in the future one or more of these funds may be, serviced and/or managed by ARCC or certain of ARCC's controlled portfolio companies. Thus, each of the Affiliated Funds could be deemed
	to be a person related to the ARCC Funds in a manner described by Section 57(b) and therefore prohibited by Section 57(a)(4) and Rule 17d-1 from participating in
	Co-Investment Transactions, Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions.





	E.    REQUESTED RELIEF





	        Accordingly, Applicants respectfully request an Order of the Commission, subject to the terms set forth in the Application, pursuant to Section 57(i) and
	Rule 17d-l to permit the ARCC Funds to participate in Co-Investment Transactions, Joint Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions with Affiliated
	Funds.




	16























	F.     PRECEDENTS





	         The Commission has granted co-investment relief on numerous occasions in recent years.

	13

	Although allocation formulae,
	approval procedures and presumptions may differ in detail as a result of circumstances and structures being different for each applicant, Applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth
	as conditions for the relief requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited orders. We note, in particular, that the co-investment protocol to be
	followed by the Applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol followed by Medley Capital Corporation and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on March 26, 2012 (the
	"




	Medley Order




	")

	14

	; to the extent the requested relief varies from the Medley Order, the variations reflect the size and specific business
	structure of Ares, the ARCC Funds and the Affiliated Funds, as well as the greater complexity of their organization in general. Indeed, the Medley Platform includes two affiliated advisers of the
	BDC's adviser and four existing funds that are prohibited from completing "joint transactions" with the BDC, whereas in the Ares platform there are over 55 Affiliated Investment Managers and over 85
	Existing Affiliated Funds.

	G.    APPLICANT'S LEGAL ANALYSIS





	        In accordance with Rule 17d-1 (made applicable to BDCs pursuant to Section 57(i)), the Commission may grant the requested relief as to
	any particular joint transaction if it finds that the participation of the ARCC Funds (or any person they control) in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of
	the Act and is not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. Necessarily, an analysis of whether exemptive relief is appropriate in a particular case depends upon
	the specific facts and circumstances of that case.




	        As
	required by Rule 17d-1(b), the terms and conditions proposed in the Application ensure that the terms on which Co-Investment Transactions, Joint
	Follow-On Transactions and Joint Exit Transactions may be made are consistent with the participation of the ARCC Funds being on a basis that it is neither different from nor less
	advantageous than other participants, thus protecting the shareholders or interest holders of any participant from being disadvantaged. For each Co-Investment Transaction, if the aggregate
	amount recommended to be invested by the ARCC Fund in such Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be invested by all Affiliated Funds in the same
	Co-Investment Transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the amount of the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on the amount that each
	such party would have invested if the amount of the investment opportunity was sufficient to satisfy each party's proposed investment.




	        Further,
	the terms and conditions will ensure that all Co-Investment Transactions are reasonable and fair to the ARCC Funds and the Affiliated Funds and do not involve
	overreaching by any person concerned, including ACM. The decision for ARCC to participate in any Co-Investment Transaction will be based on the recommendation of ACM and the approval of a
	Required Majority of the Eligible Directors, or in the case of any Downstream Managed Fund, based on the recommendation of its investment manager and the approval of its Independent Party.





	H.    CONDITIONS





	        Applicants agree that any Order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:





	1.




	When
	an investment adviser or manager, as applicable, of an ARCC Fund (each, an "




	Adviser




	") is notified of a
	Potential Co-Investment Transaction that falls within an ARCC Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Adviser will make an independent determination of the
	appropriateness of the investment for the ARCC Fund in light of the ARCC Fund's then-current circumstances.




























	2.





	 





	(a)





	 





	If the Adviser deems the ARCC Fund's participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the ARCC Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the ARCC
	Fund.







	 





	 





	(b)





	 





	If the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction by the ARCC Fund and the Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the
	investment opportunity, the amount proposed to be invested by each party will be allocated among them pro rata based on the amount that each such party would have invested if the amount of the investment opportunity was sufficient to satisfy each
	party's proposed investment.






	    









	18












	(c)




	After
	making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential
	Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, for their consideration. An
	ARCC Fund will co-invest with an Affiliated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction only if, prior to participating in such Potential Co-Investment
	Transaction a Required Majority or the Independent Party, as applicable, concludes that:






	(i)




	the
	terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to ARCC and its
	shareholders or the Downstream Managed Fund and its interest holders, as applicable, and do not involve overreaching in respect of ARCC or its shareholders or the Downstream Managed Fund or its
	interest holders on the part of any person concerned;






	(ii)




	the
	transaction is consistent with:






	(A)




	the
	interests of ARCC's shareholders or a Downstream Managed Fund's interest holders, as applicable; and






	(B)




	the
	ARCC Fund's investment objective and strategies, (which in the case of ARCC shall be as described in ARCC's registration statements on
	Form N-2 and other filings made with the Commission by ARCC under the Securities Act of 1933, any reports filed by ARCC with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
	and ARCC's reports to shareholders);








	(iii)




	the
	investment by the Affiliated Fund(s) would not disadvantage the ARCC Fund, and participation by the ARCC Fund would not be on a basis different from
	(except that the settlement date for an Affiliated Fund in a Co-Investment Transaction may occur up to seven days after the settlement date for the ARCC Fund, and vice-versa)
	or less advantageous than that of such Affiliated Fund(s);

	provided

	that, if an Affiliated Fund, but not the ARCC Fund, gains the right to nominate a director for
	election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event will
	not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, from reaching the conclusions required by this condition 2(c)(iii), if:






	(A)




	the
	Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;






	(B)




	the
	Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, with respect to the actions of the director or
	the information received by the board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and






	(C)




	any
	fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any Affiliated Fund receives in connection with the right of the
	Affiliated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the
	Affiliated Fund (who may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating ARCC Fund in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and








	(iv)




	the
	proposed investment by the ARCC Fund will not benefit ACM, Ares Management or any Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any of them (other than
	the parties to the








	19













	Co-Investment
	Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by Condition 14, (B) to the extent permitted by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable,
	(C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation
	described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).








	3.




	Each
	ARCC Fund has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount offered to
	the ARCC Fund.






	4.




	Each
	Adviser will present to the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential
	Co-Investment Transactions consummated by any Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the ARCC Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies and were
	formally presented in writing to the investment committees of such Affiliated Funds that were not made available to the ARCC Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not made
	available to the ARCC Fund. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of ARCC and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by
	the Commission and its staff.






	5.




	Except
	for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8, an ARCC Fund will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer
	in which (i) an Affiliated Fund is an existing investor, (ii) any person described in Section 57(b) (other than by reason of the reference in Section 57(b)(2) to
	Section 2(a)(3)(D) insofar as certain Affiliated Funds are structured as partnerships) in relation to an ARCC Fund that the Adviser knows or reasonably should know is an existing investor, or
	(iii) any person described in Section 57(e) in relation to an ARCC Fund that the Adviser knows is an existing investor.






	6.




	The
	ARCC Funds will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be
	purchased, settlement date (except that the settlement date for an Affiliated Fund in a Co-Investment Transaction may occur up to seven days after the settlement date for an ARCC Fund, and
	vice-versa) and registration rights (if any) will be the same for each participating ARCC Fund and Affiliated Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund, but not an ARCC Fund, of the right to
	nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management
	of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.































	7.




	 




	(a)




	 




	If an Affiliated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in an investment that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction or engage in a Joint Exit Transaction (involving the same investment or a
	different investment), the Adviser will:







	 





	 





	 





	 





	(i)





	 





	notify each ARCC Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction or that holds the investment implicated by the Joint Exit Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time;
	and







	 





	 





	 





	 





	(ii)





	 





	formulate a recommendation as to participation by such ARCC Funds in the proposed disposition.







	 





	 





	(b)





	 





	Each such ARCC Fund will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated
	Fund(s).









	20




































	 




	 




	(c)




	 




	Each such ARCC Fund may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority of Independent Party, as applicable, if: (i) the proposed participation of such ARCC Fund(s) and each
	Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, has approved as being in the best interests of such ARCC
	Fund(s) the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this Application); and (iii) the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, of such ARCC Fund(s) is provided on a quarterly basis with
	a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to such ARCC Fund(s)' participation to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, and such
	ARCC Fund(s) will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, determines that it is in such ARCC Fund(s)' best interests.







	 





	 





	(d)





	 





	Each Affiliated Fund and ARCC Fund participating in such disposition will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.







	8.





	 





	(a)





	 





	If an Affiliated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction or to engage in a Joint Follow-On Transaction (involving the same
	investment or a different investment), the Adviser will:







	 





	 





	 





	 





	(i)





	 





	notify each ARCC Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction or that holds the investment implicated by the Joint Follow-On Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time;
	and







	 





	 





	 





	 





	(ii)





	 





	formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by such ARCC Fund(s).







	 





	 





	(b)





	 





	Each such ARCC Fund will have the right to participate in such Follow-On Investments on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms (except to the extent that the settlement dates may differ as
	contemplated in conditions 2 and 6) and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated Fund(s).







	 





	 





	(c)





	 





	Each such ARCC Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of such ARCC Fund(s) and each Affiliated Fund in such
	investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Board or Independent party, as applicable, of such ARCC Fund(s) has approved as being in the best interests of
	the ARCC Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this Application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to such ARCC Fund(s)' participation
	to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, and such ARCC Fund(s) will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, determines that it is in such ARCC
	Fund(s)' best interests.









	21




































	 




	 




	(d)




	 




	If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:







	 





	 





	 





	 





	(i)





	 





	the amount of the opportunity is not based on the ARCC Fund's and the Affiliated Fund(s)' outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and







	 





	 





	 





	 





	(ii)





	 





	the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested by such ARCC Fund(s) in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by each Affiliated Fund in the same transaction,
	exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro rata based on the amount that each such party would have invested if the amount of the investment opportunity was sufficient to
	satisfy each party's proposed investment.







	 





	 





	(e)





	 





	The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this application.










	9.




	The
	Independent Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential
	Co-Investment Transactions that fell within the ARCC Fund's then current Objectives and Strategies and Co-Investment Transactions for the applicable ARCC Fund that were
	consummated by an Affiliated Fund, including investments made by Affiliated Funds that were formally presented to the ARCC Fund's investment committee or similar governing body in writing, but that
	the ARCC Fund declined to participate in, so that the Independent Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, may determine whether all Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fell
	within the ARCC Fund's then current Objectives and Strategies presented to the ARCC Fund's investment committee or similar governing body for consideration in writing but were declined and
	Co-Investment Transactions made during the preceding quarter by an Affiliated Fund, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Directors and all Independent
	Parties will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the ARCC Funds of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.






	10.




	ARCC
	will maintain the records required by Section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved
	by the Required Majority under Section 57(f).






	11.




	No
	Independent Director will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an "affiliated person" (as defined in the Act)
	of any Downstream Managed Fund or any Affiliated Fund.






	12.




	The
	expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any investments acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including,
	without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such investments registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933) will, to the extent not payable by ACM, Ivy Hill or Ares Management
	under their respective investment advisory agreements with the ARCC Funds and the Affiliated Funds, be shared by the co-investors in proportion to the relative amounts of the investments
	held or being acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.






	13.




	Any
	transaction fee (including break-up, structuring or commitment fees but excluding broker's fees contemplated by Section 57(k) of the
	Act, as applicable, and agency fees payable to a party acting as agent (or in a similar role) in respect of an investment) received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be
	distributed to the participating ARCC Fund(s) and Affiliated Fund(s) on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment
	Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having
	the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and





	22











	the
	account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating ARCC Fund(s) and the Affiliated Fund(s) based on the amounts they invest in such
	Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, Ares Management, ACM, Ivy Hill or an Affiliate of the foregoing (other than the ARCC Funds) will receive additional compensation or
	remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) as set forth in this condition 13, (b) in the case of the
	ARCC Funds and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation
	described in condition 3(c)(iii)(C), and (c) investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreements with each Affiliated Fund or ARCC Fund).
