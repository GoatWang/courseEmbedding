About us






Blue Rock AdvisorsTM, LLC is dedicated to being the leading focused manager of managers specializing in the low net exposure, long-short equity style of hedged portfolios.
We provide our clients with access to a diversified mix of the most talented and driven managers in this unique investment style. Blue Rock provides this access through a family of intelligently structured multi-manager funds that seek attractive return targets, controlled volatility and minimal correlation to other asset classes.
Founded in 1989 and 100% employee owned, Blue Rock has the experience and knowledge to provide our clients with a high-quality alternative investment product while employing processes and strategies designed to minimize risk.



Our ProductsOur HistoryOur Products




Blue Rock manages a variety of low net exposure, long-short equity multi-manager funds designed to meet our institutional clients’ unique needs. We advise a range of funds, from our flagship fund to our alpha overlay and liquid alpha funds.
Our managed portfolios are diversified across a wide range of stock selection methodologies implemented by Blue Rock’s underlying managers. We are also believers that size is counterproductive to performance, preferring to invest with smaller, more nimble managers. Our style-focused analytics and detailed due diligence and monitoring procedures assist a wide range of institutional fiduciaries to participate with greater confidence.
We seek the following investment objectives while managing our funds and portfolios:
• To achieve consistent positive returns across market cycles
• To lessen market risk
• To mitigate factor risks
We believe that a low net exposure, long-short equity approach can complement a wide range of institutional portfolios that are seeking to mitigate market direction risk and further diversify with low-correlated investments.














Our History




Founded in 1989 by Robert W. Fullerton, Blue Rock is dedicated exclusively to managing low net exposure, long-short equity multi-manager funds.
Blue Rock’s flagship fund was launched in 1989 with a single manager. The firm immediately began to research other managers offering low net, long-short portfolios and decided to focus entirely on this strategy.
In July 1991, Blue Rock’s flagship fund was converted from a single manager fund to a multi-manager fund. Mark Steen, Principal, joined the firm that same year.
Today, Blue Rock tracks and maintains research on more than 500+ low net, long-short equity managers in our proprietary database. Blue Rock has a 26-year track record investing exclusively with low net, long-short equity managers.

Our Strategy






We provide our clients with access to a diversified mix of the most talented and driven managers in this unique investment style. Blue Rock provides this access through a family of intelligently structured multi-manager funds that seek attractive return targets, controlled volatility and minimal correlation to other asset classes.



Low Net, Long-Short Equity InvestingThe Look of Low Net, Long-Short Equity InvestmentsLow Net, Long-Short Equity Investing




Low Net, Long-Short Equity Investing
Low net, long-short equity strategies are designed to reduce market direction risk and limit downside risk.
Buy long equities expected to outperform the market.
Sell short equities expected to underperform the market.
Investing in a well-diversified variety of stock selection methodologies in a highly-disciplined, risk-controlled framework assists in achieving investment objectives.
Low net, long-short investment seeks to provide low correlation with stocks, bonds and other alternatives strategies.
Investments are, with few exceptions, in publicly-traded, liquid equities.














The Look of Low Net, Long-Short Equity Investments




The Look of a Low Net, Long-Short Equity Investment
Blue Rock’s low net, long-short equity strategy provides exposure to a variety of stock selection methodologies in a highly-disciplined, risk-controlled framework.
Using low net exposure, nearly market neutral, as a “risk framework” enables a portfolio manager to structure a low volatility portfolio, one that is designed in an effort to mitigate market-related risks and derive value-added/alpha from ‘stock picking’.
Employing “long-short” as the ‘stock picking’ strategy provides an opportunity to balance the inefficiencies present in long-only strategies and thereby perform well in most market conditions.
The merging of a market-neutral risk discipline with a well-balanced long-short stock selection methodology provides clients with the unique opportunity to seek consistent attractive returns in a strategy designed to minimize volatility.

Background Information:


Blue Rock Advisors LLC »
Blue Rock provides discretionary investment advisory services to private investment funds by selecting third party investment managers to offer a “fund-of-funds” or \"\"multi-manager\"\" investment strategy. The firm focuses exclusively on low net exposure long-short equity investments. Currently, the firm tracks and maintains opinions on their entire investable universe of low net exposure long-short equity portfolio managers (approximately 450). Blue Rock does not perform analysis of individual securities. Rather, they perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses in evaluating third party portfolio managers and their investment strategies and commingled investment vehicles. Through the private investment partnerships, investors in the funds have access to a diversified mix of portfolio managers. The funds seek to lessen market risk and achieve consistent positive returns across market cycles.

                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

About us






Blue Rock AdvisorsTM, LLC is dedicated to being the leading focused manager of managers specializing in the low net exposure, long-short equity style of hedged portfolios.
We provide our clients with access to a diversified mix of the most talented and driven managers in this unique investment style. Blue Rock provides this access through a family of intelligently structured multi-manager funds that seek attractive return targets, controlled volatility and minimal correlation to other asset classes.
Founded in 1989 and 100% employee owned, Blue Rock has the experience and knowledge to provide our clients with a high-quality alternative investment product while employing processes and strategies designed to minimize risk.



Our ProductsOur HistoryOur Products




Blue Rock manages a variety of low net exposure, long-short equity multi-manager funds designed to meet our institutional clients’ unique needs. We advise a range of funds, from our flagship fund to our alpha overlay and liquid alpha funds.
Our managed portfolios are diversified across a wide range of stock selection methodologies implemented by Blue Rock’s underlying managers. We are also believers that size is counterproductive to performance, preferring to invest with smaller, more nimble managers. Our style-focused analytics and detailed due diligence and monitoring procedures assist a wide range of institutional fiduciaries to participate with greater confidence.
We seek the following investment objectives while managing our funds and portfolios:
• To achieve consistent positive returns across market cycles
• To lessen market risk
• To mitigate factor risks
We believe that a low net exposure, long-short equity approach can complement a wide range of institutional portfolios that are seeking to mitigate market direction risk and further diversify with low-correlated investments.














Our History




Founded in 1989 by Robert W. Fullerton, Blue Rock is dedicated exclusively to managing low net exposure, long-short equity multi-manager funds.
Blue Rock’s flagship fund was launched in 1989 with a single manager. The firm immediately began to research other managers offering low net, long-short portfolios and decided to focus entirely on this strategy.
In July 1991, Blue Rock’s flagship fund was converted from a single manager fund to a multi-manager fund. Mark Steen, Principal, joined the firm that same year.
Today, Blue Rock tracks and maintains research on more than 500+ low net, long-short equity managers in our proprietary database. Blue Rock has a 26-year track record investing exclusively with low net, long-short equity managers.

Our Strategy






We provide our clients with access to a diversified mix of the most talented and driven managers in this unique investment style. Blue Rock provides this access through a family of intelligently structured multi-manager funds that seek attractive return targets, controlled volatility and minimal correlation to other asset classes.



Low Net, Long-Short Equity InvestingThe Look of Low Net, Long-Short Equity InvestmentsLow Net, Long-Short Equity Investing




Low Net, Long-Short Equity Investing
Low net, long-short equity strategies are designed to reduce market direction risk and limit downside risk.
Buy long equities expected to outperform the market.
Sell short equities expected to underperform the market.
Investing in a well-diversified variety of stock selection methodologies in a highly-disciplined, risk-controlled framework assists in achieving investment objectives.
Low net, long-short investment seeks to provide low correlation with stocks, bonds and other alternatives strategies.
Investments are, with few exceptions, in publicly-traded, liquid equities.














The Look of Low Net, Long-Short Equity Investments




The Look of a Low Net, Long-Short Equity Investment
Blue Rock’s low net, long-short equity strategy provides exposure to a variety of stock selection methodologies in a highly-disciplined, risk-controlled framework.
Using low net exposure, nearly market neutral, as a “risk framework” enables a portfolio manager to structure a low volatility portfolio, one that is designed in an effort to mitigate market-related risks and derive value-added/alpha from ‘stock picking’.
Employing “long-short” as the ‘stock picking’ strategy provides an opportunity to balance the inefficiencies present in long-only strategies and thereby perform well in most market conditions.
The merging of a market-neutral risk discipline with a well-balanced long-short stock selection methodology provides clients with the unique opportunity to seek consistent attractive returns in a strategy designed to minimize volatility.
