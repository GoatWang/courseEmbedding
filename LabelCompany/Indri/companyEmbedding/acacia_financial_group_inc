ACACIA Financial Group - About Us



































 





                        Acacia Financial Group, Inc. (or AFG) is an independent, women owned full-service financial advisory firm providing comprehensive financial advisory services to state, county, and local governments in New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.  
AFG was launched in May of 2006 by certain prior members of Public Financial Management, Inc. and Municipal Advisory Partners, Inc. with the conviction that governmental entities would benefit from the services of a financial advisor that was not only expert in the issuance of debt, but was also cognizant of the policy concerns unique to the public sector.  Our roster of clients served and the complexity of the financings undertaken on their behalf speak to the success of our efforts. AFG places a premium on senior level service, a commodity prized by our client base and a primary reason new clients elect to use the firm. 
The professionals of Acacia Financial Group, Inc. continually strive to provide thoughtful advice and analysis to the complex task of designing and implementing public finance strategies.  It is important to note that the quality of work and level of service provided to an account is a direct function of the individuals assigned to work on that account.  AFG’s shareholders each have in excess of 10 years of direct municipal bond financing experience, gained through hands-on experience as advisors, underwriters and securities analysts.  During the course of their careers, AFG’s professionals have advised issuers on project financing, debt management, rating strategies, derivative products and investment strategies.
Proven Track Record
                      The firm’s team of professionals has a proven track record of success managing engagements for governmental entities ranging from small local governments to the largest bi-state authorities. AFG’s professionals have served as financial advisor on over $53 billion of taxable and tax-exempt financings since 2001. This combined experience would have ranked the firm number one in the State of New Jersey in both the number of transactions completed and total par value issued and in the top 10 nationally.
Independence
                      AFG is a corporation whose shareholders include some of the most recognizable and respected names in the industry.  The firm is wholly owned by the shareholders and is not a subsidiary of any other company.  As the firm does not engage in the underwriting or distribution of bonds, we can assure our clients of the highest level of objectivity in the advice rendered; advice which is free of the potential conflicts of interest that can arise from a motivation to participate in current or future underwritings.  
Commitment to Public Finance
                      Acacia Financial Group, Inc. was founded with the expressed goal of providing financial advisory services to governmental entities.  As other corporations change their level of commitment to various business lines depending on stock prices or mergers, AFG’s sole line of business is the provision of financial advisory services.
AFG’s professionals have invested their municipal finance expertise in creating a firm that capitalizes on their success in providing quality financial advisory services. AFG’s professionals have always remained focused on its mandate to provide financial advisory services to governmental entities and have worked hard to establish a firm which will continue to serve our clients well into the future.
Commitment to Quality Management
                      AFG’s definition of quality financial advisory services extends beyond knowledge of the public finance industry.  It encompasses commitment to the client's mission, creativity in developing financial solutions and a demonstrated determination to solve problems and overcome obstacles on a client's behalf.  Other qualities, too, are important to a financial advisor's ability to be an effective financial counselor to a client over the long term.  Broadly, these include sensitivity to the environment in which the issuer is operating and a well-developed, instinctive ability to structure financings within larger public policy objectives.

Dollars & Cents Focus With Heart & Soul Devotion


Acacia is an independent Financial Advisor exclusively dedicated to the needs of government entities.
Acacia specializes in effectively raising money to fund significant community projects—like construction of schools and hospitals, roadway and utility improvements, waste solutions, and innovative green initiatives. So, in a sense, we touch every individual, family, and business.
We’re a proven resource for expert design and implementation of effective strategies. And we believe that our approach—complementing a dollars-and-cents focus with a heart-and-soul devotion—is on the leading edge of a transformation in the broader financial sector.
Call it bedside manner or simply “service,” but it’s something most companies in our line of work seem to overlook. So we’ve built Acacia on the dual principles of financial expertise and client care—both tailored to the public sector—because we know it can be the difference between competence and excellence. 

We’re hands-on and earnest, but we’re also tough and tenacious when we have to be. And we may not be the biggest, but don’t let our size fool you—the strength of our credentials is virtually unmatched, and our well-rounded team and full suite of services make us a good fit for any type of government organization or initiative.
Our clients recognize how much they get with us—how we take care of them, help safeguard their interests, and manage their finances in the most effective and caring manner possible. They appreciate the way we enable them to serve their constituencies and enrich their communities. And that’s why many of them have followed us to Acacia, extending relationships that go back a decade or more. Again, it’s a matter of trust. 




Our Story
Acacia Financial Group is the product of a collaboration among a handful of youthful yet proven finance executives. Each respected and successful in their own right, they decided to form the company after working together at one of the field’s more notable firms. Beyond the significant skills and success they all shared, there was a common vision for a new breed of public financial guidance—an ideal that offered the technical abilities the bigger players boasted, but with a decidedly human element.
That inspiring vision for the future led to a brainstorming session among friends that produced the seeds of what has blossomed into Acacia Financial Group.
The firm’s founding members bring great perspective to the business and its clients. They’ve followed different paths on their way to meeting at a fruitful crossroads. The senior team includes entrepreneurs who have built and sold multiple businesses, investment bankers who earned their stripes on Wall Street, and individuals who have participated in various levels of government and public policy. While varied in their backgrounds, their view of the field as well as Acacia’s place within it could not be more unified.
Today, as Acacia continues its rapid growth—in terms of both transactions managed as well as its national expansion—the promise that our founders embraced years ago when first entertaining the idea of starting a new company is as singular and solid as the tree for which we’re named.

Independent Financial Guidance for Government Initiatives




Services


Quite simply, we exist to help vital public initiatives succeed


Acacia assists its clients with the financing of significant community projects such as the construction of schools and hospitals, roadway and utility improvements, waste solutions, and innovative green initiatives; the projects that every individual, family, and business depend on.  Regardless of the type, size, or complexity of an initiative, its successful completion ultimately depends on the skills and motivation of the people involved in the process. 

Given this public visibility and far-reaching impact, these projects demand a blend of financial know-how, strategic thinking, creativity, and interpersonal skills to get all parties to work together.
The Financial Advisor is an integral component to this process. In addition their quantitative responsibilities, they often play the role of the quarterback, responsible for managing timelines, personalities, legal regulations, market conditions, and, of course, policy objectives. 


Debt
Our professionals have provided financial advisory services in connection with over $73 billion in taxable and tax-exempt securities over the past five years for a variety of government entities including state and state-level authorities and agencies, county and county-level authorities, municipalities and municipal authorities, school districts, fire districts, and regional authorities. Acacia has consistently ranked among the top financial advisors on a national basis. Through the third quarter of 2015, Acacia was ranked 4th among financial advisors in the nation.   In 2014, Acacia was ranked 6th among top financial advisors in the nation, advising on 137 transactions totaling over $14 billion in par amount. The transactions completed include competitive and negotiated transactions, private placements, general obligation and revenue backed bonds, fixed and variable rate securities, note issuances, and several others.
The Acacia team is uniquely qualified to assist their clients in developing and executing any finance plan to minimize interest cost and maximize flexibility, while achieving financial objectives.  Acacia takes an active role in assisting its clients in the structuring and the execution of bond transactions.  Our professionals assist their clients in considering alternative financing opportunities and in evaluating their benefits, risks, the credit implications.
Acacia is experienced in the execution of both competitive and negotiated sale transactions.  For competitive transactions, Acacia will run all bond sizings and provide advice on the appropriate bid parameters based on then prevailing market conditions.  For a negotiated sale, Acacia will advise the client on the benefits of offering bonds to retail, tailor couponing to specific investor interests and the flexibility on the sale date to respond to changing market conditions.  Our professionals will provide sensitivity analysis on various structuring options such as call provisions, couponing variations and final maturity, balancing yield with call flexibility.  Additionally, Acacia will prepare detailed cash-flows and verify all final numbers prepared by the underwriter.  
Acacia’s debt assistance also includes the preparation and review of financing documents, the coordination of presentations to rating agencies and the investor community, and comprehensive debt portfolio management with a focus for large scale policy objectives.  

Consulting
Our professionals have been able to apply our extensive quantitative expertise to strategic consulting engagements such as multi-year plans, management assessments, early retirement feasibility studies, energy conversation analysis, regionalization studies, acquisition studies, public-private partnership studies, economic impact studies and capital/budget planning and development.
Our professionals’ experience and ability to analyze operations and services, along with their associated fiscal impacts, is clear. Projects are delivered with fees and on a timetable consistent with those agreed upon with the client.  Consulting services are often uniquely designed to address the specific challenges facing any given client. 

Derivatives
With the use of derivative products among municipal bond issuers, the major auditing firms, government regulators, rating agencies, bond insurers and institutional investors have come to expect periodic valuations, reports and policy review from a qualified, independent derivative specialist. Acacia’s professionals understand the importance of prompt, accessible and accurate information concerning each client’s outstanding swap portfolio, which enables them to address all policy, rating agency, regulatory, accounting and legislative concerns. We are equally aware of our clients’ need to receive professional consultation on market opportunities and risks on a continuing and periodic basis.
We work closely with clients in evaluating alternative financing structures. The analysis for swap agreements and other derivative products will generally include the performance of financing structures over various projected interest rate scenarios. Our professionals have served as advisors for a variety of derivative products such as forward purchase and sale agreements, re-purchase agreements, swaps, swaptions and forward/warrant agreements.
As swap advisors, Acacia has the ability to price BMA and LIBOR-based spot and forward starting swaps, basis swaps, total return swaps, CAPS and swaptions, including European, Bermudan and American options. Acacia employs a broad range analysis fed by real-time market data from a number of industry sources including Bloomberg. Our system capabilities and in-house market expertise include the ability to model any derivative product used in the municipal markets. We employ proprietary software which calculates the derivative valuations. In addition, we have several other proprietary models and our own in-house models and notification tools which enable us to better value and monitor swap transactions.
