This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

About Cantabio Pharmaceuticals
Overview
Cantabio Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a preclinical stage biotechnology company focusing on commercializing novel therapies and the intellectual property generated from our research and development activities for Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other related neurodegenerative diseases. Our strategy integrates a detailed therapeutic focus, target family biophysics, and drug discovery technology and expertise into an innovative drug discovery approach, which is currently identifying and developing small molecule pharmacological chaperones for clinical trials. In addition, the company is developing therapeutic proteins that can pass through the blood-brain barrier to supplement existing levels of proteins which display loss of function during disease conditions.
Company History
The company was founded in Palo Alto, California in 2009 as Gardedam Therapeutics in order to pursue novel drug discovery research to develop pharmacological chaperones targeting a number of proteins linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The companies’ R&D was strengthened with an initial partnership with Dr. C. Rochet at Purdue University and Novalix and Gardedam was awarded two separate grants in collaboration with Dr. Rochet in 2010 and 2013 by the Michael J. Fox Foundation in support of its DJ-1 therapeutic project. Cantabio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was established through the merger of Gardedam Therapeutics with Cantabio Pharmaceuticals in November of 2015.
Operations
Cantabio Pharmaceuticals conducts in house R&D on critical elements of its drug discovery pipeline, while forming strategic alliances around novel technologies and outsourcing generic research activities to established contract research organizations. Cantabio has operations in Palo Alto (USA), Cambridge (UK) and Budapest (Hungary) where the company carries out in-house R&D in wet laboratory facilities. This balance of out-sourced and in-house R&D capabilities has enabled Cantabio to maintain high levels of operational efficiency and highly effective use of funds, while ensuring development and operation of key technologies in-house.

Therapeutic Targets















	Scientific Approach
 




Therapeutic Targets
DJ-1 Protein
Loss of and reduced function of the DJ-1 protein has been linked to the onset of a variety of diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and type II diabetes, while DJ-1 overexpression is a marker of a variety of cancers. The DJ-1 protein is considered to be one of the primary therapeutic targets for Parkinson’s disease, as it is genetically linked to the onset of familial Parkinson’s disease and loss of its functions is associated with triggering sporadic Parkinson’s disease. DJ-1 is proposed to have multiple functions, including REDOX-sensitive antioxidant and chaperon activities. For example, it inhibits the aggregation of a-synuclein, a process linked to the onset of Parkinson’s Disease. The down-regulation of endogenous DJ-1 sensitizes neurons to cell death induced by oxidative insults, whereas elevated levels of wild-type, but not mutant, DJ-1 protect neurons from oxidative stress and other protein misfolding related insults. DJ-1 loss-of-function flies are also hypersensitive to oxidative stress and DJ-1 knockout mice show nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficits and are hypersensitive to the toxic effects of oxidative stress. Under oxidizing conditions, DJ-1 can undergo superfluous oxidation of several Cys and Met residues, which may lead to DJ-1 inactivity as a result of structural destabilization and aggregation of the protein. Over-oxidized DJ-1 has been observed in patients with the sporadic form of PD.
Superfluous oxidation of DJ-1 during disease conditions leads to DJ-1 inactivity as a result of structural destabilization and aggregation of the protein.
Tau protein
Aggregation of the Tau protein is linked to the onset and progression of Tauopathies, which represent a subset of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which represents around 90% of incidences, and frontotemporal dementias (FTD). In these diseases Tau protein accumulates into protein deposits known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the patient’s brain. There is an established link between familial mutations in the Tau gene on chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and early-onset forms of FTD with Parkinsonism, and Tau is one of the currently most recognized targets for the potential treatment of AD. Under normal conditions Tau is known to stabilize microtubules within cells. In AD, however, Tau shows a reduction in its affinity towards microtubules, and this lack of binding to microtubules is thought to be one of the main reasons why Tau aggregates abnormally in this disease. Cantabio’s Tau program aims to stabilize the Tau protein and to preserve its natural function in disease affected cells.
Aβ Peptide
The aggregation and amyloid formation of the Aβ peptide is linked to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with amyloid plaques being a key pathological hallmark of AD. The 40-residue Aβ peptide is the most abundant Aβ in human normal and AD brains, followed by the 42-residue peptide. These Aβ peptides are intrinsically disordered and thus lack a stable 3D structure. Aβ peptides are produced after proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein at cholesterol-rich regions of neuronal membranes and secreted into the extracellular space. While their function is not well understood, it is now widely accepted that oligomeric species of Aβ peptides generated through their aggregation process, rather than amyloid fibrils, are the main source of Aβ related toxicity. Thus, it is the presence of these oligomers that leads to neuronal loss and pathogenicity in AD.

Cantabio Pharmaceuticals Announces the Development of Small Molecule Chaperones of the Abeta Peptide for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease in Collaboration with NovAliX




















April 12, 2016 12:00 ET

 | Source: Cantabio Pharmaceuticals Inc.






PALO ALTO, Calif., April  12, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cantabio Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OTCQB:CTBO) announced today a new preclinical therapeutic program for Alzheimer’s Disease which it is pursuing through its drug discovery partnership with NovAliX. This program is aimed at the development of small molecule chaperones that stabilize the Abeta peptide, the aggregation of which is considered to be a key element in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. This new program, which is the result of collaborative work between Cantabio and NovAliX, is based on the discovery of novel small molecules that interact with the Abeta peptide, which were identified using NovAliX’s high throughput chemical microarray based surface plasmon resonance (SPR-WORM) screen, a unique high throughput biophysics based binding assay platform.  Cantabio aims to develop a novel therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which impacts an estimated 5.4 million Americans, including 200,000 individuals below the age of 65. Alzheimer’s is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, with 700,000 seniors expected to die in 2016 with the disease. The annual number of new cases of Alzheimer's is projected to double by 2050, with a public cost of direct care currently at $236 billion. There is currently no disease modifying treatment available for this growing problem. Dr. Gergely Toth, Cantabio's CEO, said, "We are delighted to announce this exciting program, which fits in well with Cantabio’s existing portfolio of candidates and further demonstrates our innovative pharmacological chaperone based drug discovery approach in the field of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and related diseases. Our collaboration with NovAliX has been highly productive and has helped us to develop novel therapeutic candidates using their unique high throughput SPR-WORM screen. NovAliX has always been very supportive of our approach and vision; we look forward to continuing to work with them as our industrial partner in drug discovery and to continue to develop candidate therapies in this exciting and highly promising area.  Our work gives us the potential to address important disease targets and to tackle intrinsically disordered proteins such as the Abeta peptide.  The aggregation and amyloid formation of the Abeta peptide has been a major focus of Alzheimer’s disease targeted therapies, to date typically focussed on immunotherapy approaches.  We believe that our Abeta small molecule pharmacological chaperone program is a strong alternative to these efforts and a novel therapeutic approach, which has the potential to be a more cost effective solution for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease." NovAliX’s CEO Dr Denis Zeyer said, “We are happy to be working with the Cantabio team to develop exciting new technologies and to showcase the very high potential of the SPR-WORM screen to identify valuable chemical starting points for the targeting of protein – protein interactions. Cantabio’s approach to drug discovery has, we believe, high potential to produce novel, first in class therapies in these disease areas, which have a very high unmet need for disease treating drugs." About Cantabio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Cantabio is focused on bringing novel, first in class drug candidates into clinical trials and beyond through the discovery and development of innovative pharmacological chaperone and protein delivery based therapeutics, focusing on protein systems implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and oxidative stress.

Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
