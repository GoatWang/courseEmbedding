Intelligent Asset Strategies


				Asset Performance Management (APM) from GE Digital makes your operations safer and more reliable while helping to ensure optimal performance at a lower sustainable cost.

APM enables intelligent asset strategies that balance three traditionally competing priorities—reducing cost, improving availability and reliability, and managing risk—to help optimize your overall asset and operational  performance.      			

LEARN MORE 






APM Answers Your Critical Questions




 


 

● How critical is this asset?
● What is the history of this asset, and what is its current health?
● In what ways could this asset fail, how could I mitigate risk of failure, and what would it cost?
● What would be the consequences of this asset’s failure on my business?
● What action should be taken now, and what should be our overall strategy to optimize business objectives?

Personalized Support



The right ultrasound services to optimize your performance
You need to provide excellent patient experience and outcomes while effectively managing costs. GE Healthcare helps you achieve your goal with ultrasound service solutions designed to monitor and maintain your systems, ensure quality and compliance, and train and inspire your clinical and biomedical staff.


EXPERT SERVICE TEAM
Collaborating with you, we build the kind of business relationships you can trust to help make your job easier and your organization more successful. When you work with GE Healthcare, you work with real people who care about your business. You have access to one of the largest support teams and some of the most knowledgeable engineers in the industry.


ADVANCED SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY 

On-site and remote teams plus premium service technology – seamlessly integrated and always available 
Expert remote clinical support helps save time, delivering fast answers, fast fixes and fast resolution to your issues and questions 
Secure broadband connection and integrated technologies allow you to solve many issues remotely: 

     – Review your complete service history 
     – Diagnose equipment issues 
     – Order parts for priority delivery 
     – Get many problems repaired remotely



Strategic Flexibility


The right service agreements to support your priorities and goals
Whether you’re a small clinic or a large health system, whether you have no in-house technical support or your own clinical engineering department, we understand that you need a comprehensive range of services to meet your operational and financial goals.
Working together, we’ll tailor a service program that evolves with you and that is designed to help keep your operation productive and profitable and ensure your patients receive the care they need.


A SERVICE AGREEMENT THAT WORKS FOR YOU 
Comprehensive asset management and a full maintenance solution: With a full-service contract, you can be confident that your ultrasound equipment is maintained to the highest standards, you have accidental probe coverage, software updates, and your uptime is consistently high. 
In-house services: If full-service isn’t what you need, you can take advantage of easy access to GE’s rigorous preventative and maintenance services and cost effective parts solutions as needed. We’ll support your in-house team with the appropriate solutions for your ultrasound department, from testing and maintenance to training. 



Beyond System Maintenance

The right options for continuous success
Maintaining your ultrasound equipment is only part of the excellent support you can expect from GE Healthcare. We provide a full range of services to maximize your investment, manage the data you accrue, assure best practices and keep your equipment in compliance.



PROBE SERVICES 
GE Healthcare’s probe management services let you manage your probe fleet efficiently and extend the useful life of your equipment: 

Prevent probe failures with probe care education and storage solutions 
Adopt high-level disinfection solutions  
Diagnose probe performance and safety with testing and diagnosis services 
Reliable repair and replacement services



ACCREDITATION SUPPORT 
Ultrasound accreditation demonstrates to patients, insurance companies and your community that you voluntarily adhere to best practices, high equipment standards and quality assurance guidelines. 

Documentation support for Equipment Quality Checks (EQC) and Image Quality Checks (IQC) 
On-site periodic evaluations by GE field engineers based on your accreditation requirements 

These services may be included in your GE service contract. If not, or you are using non-GE equipment, you can still participate. 
A quality assurance program with GE Healthcare allows your clinicians to focus on their regular tasks without worrying about system performance and image quality checks.


TRAINING AND EDUCATION 
With new innovations in technology and frequent software updates, your clinicians need high quality training to keep on top of their game. GE provides them with the knowledge they need to use equipment features at their fullest and optimize your ultrasound investment, at initial training and throughout the lifecycle of your system. 
We offer on-going education through a flexible training model designed for your private practice, in-house and clinical staff to help you support and retain key talent and help increase operational efficiency. 
A wide range of ultrasound and leadership courses through our TiP-EdSM Online continuing education program contribute to your clinical staff’s continuing education requirement. These courses can also be scheduled at a GE location or your facility. Your investment in staff education will help you meet your clinical, productivity and financial goals.
