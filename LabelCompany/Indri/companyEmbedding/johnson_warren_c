Our History  


        In 1885, long before anyone talks about carbon footprints or climate change, Warren Johnson launches a company to explore new ways to harness and conserve precious energy resources. In doing so, he also launches a tradition of customer-focused innovation—a tradition that has inspired thousands of employees for more than 130 years and that continues to drive the success of Johnson Controls. Even before he founds the firm now known as Johnson Controls, Warren Johnson is the quintessential inventor. His pneumatic tower clocks, electric storage batteries, wireless telegraph business and steam-powered luxury cars and postal service trucks anticipate—and shape—the future.



History Timeline









​​​1883
Warren Johnson patents the “electric tele-thermoscope,” a building temperature-control device, and travels from his Whitewater, Wis., home to Milwaukee in search of manufacturing financing. 

​​1885 
Warren Johnson partners with Milwaukee businessman and financier William Plankinton to form the Johnson Electric Service Company. Johnson serves as vice president and treasurer, and Plankinton as president. Installations at the Milwaukee Public Library and city hall help the business grow quickly. 

​​​1885 - 1910 Spirit of Invention
In the age of Edison, Bell, Daimler, Pasteur, Tesla and Ericsson, anything seems possible. It’s an era of firsts: electric lights, internal combustion engines, X-rays and hydroelectric power plants.
Against this backdrop, Warren Johnson toils for three years to invent a device to regulate room temperature. In 1883, he receives his first patent for what will be known as the electric room thermostat—an invention that launches an industry and changes how people live. Within two years, his quickly growing Johnson Electric Service Company brings evenly regulated temperatures to buildings around the world. 

​​1895 
Warren Johnson and associates patent steam valves, steam traps, pressure reduction valves, water heaters, hydraulic air compressors and electric meters in developing the first automatic zone temperature control system. A century later, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers calls it  “the grandfather of all control systems.” 

1896 ​​
A McClure’s magazine ad promises “domestic harmony and budget savings” with the Johnson Electric Service Company Furnace Draft Regulator. 

1901 
​​William Plankinton retires and Warren Johnson becomes president. Johnson’s drive for innovation leads to patents for an “auto-carriage” steam generator and a forerunner of power steering. Over the next 11 years, Johnson Electric Service Company makes 1,000 steam-powered cars, fire trucks, limousines and ambulances. 

1902 ​
With installations worldwide—including the U.S. Capitol, the New York Stock Exchange, a Warsaw factory and a palace in Tokyo—Johnson Electric Service Company changes its name to Johnson Service Company and moves to the downtown Milwaukee site that is now headquarters for Johnson Controls Building Efficiency. 

​1907 
Johnson Service Company introduces a line of gasoline cars featuring luxurious leather and wood interiors. 

1908
​The first skyscraper, Singer Sewing Machine’s New York City headquarters, has “every approved modern device for comfort, convenience and safety,” including 1,200 Johnson Service Company room thermostats. Future Johnson Controls company York International’s refrigeration system delivers “a continuous supply of cold drinking water.” 

1910 - 1935 Comfort Catches On
Construction booms. The elevator sends buildings to new heights—and multi-zone temperature controls make them comfortable places to work.
Harry Ellis becomes president when Warren Johnson passes away in 1911. Ellis sells the automotive and pneumatic clock businesses. Like Johnson, though, he emphasizes efficient manufacturing and dedicated customer service, insisting that only company technicians install Johnson Service Company building control systems.
World War I takes a bite out of civilian construction, but the company’s innovative products become money-saving necessities during the Great Depression. 

1911
​Globe Electric Company, a future Johnson Controls business, begins making electrical equipment for streetcars and street lights, and soon adds automotive battery production. 

1912
​A 15-cent U.S. postage stamp acknowledges the country’s transition to the horseless carriage, depicting a postal delivery truck made by Johnson Service Company. 

1913
​Future Johnson Controls business Hoover Steel Ball Company opens to serve the precision bearing and automotive industries. Years later, it expands into automotive seating. 

1914
​Civilian construction slows during World War I, and Johnson Service Company becomes ineligible for military procurement when the U.S. government categorizes its products as luxuries. The company continues to thrive, though, by retrofitting old buildings with temperature controls. 

1920
​As a new decade dawns, a war-weary public seeks out entertainment. Motion pictures are all the rage, and Johnson Service Company gets into the act with a product that helps make movie houses a haven of comfort: controls for air conditioning. 

​1922
The Johnson Service Company’s pneumatic system for temperature and humidity control promises fuel savings of up to 35 percent. 

1925
​Johnson Service Company buys the patent for a dual thermostat developed by the chief custodian of the New York City schools (and a Johnson Service Company customer). The device lowers temperatures automatically by sensing increasing air pressure when occupants leave a room and reduces fuel consumption—a boon during the Great Depression. 

​1929
Many companies cut costs when the stock market crashes, but Johnson Service Company’s sales remain strong for years due to a backlog of orders—and a rising demand for the dual thermostat, which automatically cuts fuel consumption when spaces are unoccupied. 

1934
​A worsening economy forces Johnson Service Company to lay off workers, reduce salaries and move sales offices to salesmen’s homes. With construction stagnant, the company focuses on retrofitting older buildings with the Duo-Stat, which saves fuel by adjusting indoor temperature as outdoor conditions change. 

​1935 - 1960 Thriving on Innovation
As the Depression grinds on, government employment programs generate construction projects for private and public buildings that need temperature regulation systems. When war breaks out again, the U.S. government classifies Johnson Service Company’s products as essential.
The war’s end unleashes demand for new buildings with modern features like air conditioning. Johnson Service Company responds by developing a pneumatic control center for controlling temperature from one location. Emphasis shifts from individual room controls to “zone control systems.” 

1938
​Joseph Cutler, who started with Johnson Service Company as a sales engineer in 1912, becomes president. Over the next 22 years, he reorganizes the sales force and adds 79 branch offices, and sales grow from $3 million in 1939 to $67.3 million in 1960. 

1940
​Johnson Service Company goes public, listing its securities over the counter. 

​1941
The U.S. government classifies building controls as essential to the war effort because they improve worker efficiency in defense plants and save fuel needed in combat zones. Johnson Service Company equips U.S. military training facilities and defense plants with temperature and humidity control systems. 

​1945
With the war’s end, new construction increases, as does demand for skilled workers. Johnson Service Company launches its first formal technical training program in New York. The Johnson Technical Institute offers the equivalent of two free years of college to employees who complete night classes or correspondence courses. 

​1949
The new United Nations building in New York City epitomizes a fresh generation of construction. Fully air-conditioned, it requires 3,600 Johnson Service Company thermostats and ancillary controls. 

​1955
Eli Lilly & Company rushes researcher Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine into mass production at its Indianapolis, Indiana, plant. Johnson Service Company installs critical temperature-regulating apparatus in rooms where the virus is grown. 

1956
​Business booms for Johnson Service Company as control systems grow more complex. The numbers of employees, branches and installations hit all-time highs, thanks to demand for pneumatic control centers that let one person monitor an entire building’s room and water temperatures and ventilation from one location. 

1960 - 1985 Expanding Worldwide
Johnson Service Company’s sales surpass US$1 billion after merging with Penn Controls. The renamed Johnson Controls expands its technological capabilities through acquisitions, starting with Globe-Union, the largest U.S. manufacturer of automotive batteries. By adding seating and plastics machinery firm Hoover Universal and seating supplier Ferro Manufacturing, Johnson Controls can design, engineer and assemble complete automotive seating systems. 

​1961
Richard Murphy becomes president. He holds that position for six years, but his overall service to the company is longer than any other employee—an amazing 63 years. 

1964
​Having already begun serving international markets through subsidiaries in England, France, Australia, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland, Johnson Service Company builds its first European manufacturing plant in Lomagna, Italy. Worldwide sales exceed US$100 million. 

​1965
Now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Johnson Service Company provides climate controls to prevent rain clouds forming in the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Cape Canaveral, Florida, vehicle assembly building. Future Johnson Controls company York International installs 10,500 tons of water chillers for air conditioning. 

​1967
Fred Brengel becomes the company’s sixth president. During his 21-year tenure, building control products are computerized, acquisitions move the company into automotive batteries and seating, and sales climb from US$140 million to $3.1 billion. 

​1968
Johnson Service Company enters the Fortune 500 after acquiring refrigeration and gas heating controls maker Penn Controls. Product line additions include refrigeration controls for supermarkets, humidity controls for agricultural drying equipment, and controls for commercial laundromats. 

1972
​Johnson Service Company introduces the JC/80, the first mini-computer for controlling building systems. It cuts fuel consumption 30 percent—and encourages building owners to automate as oil prices skyrocket. The company also adds computerized fire control and security systems for commercial buildings. 

​1974
The company changes its name to Johnson Controls, Inc. 

​1978
Johnson Controls becomes the leader in U.S. automotive battery production when it acquires Globe-Union. Founded in 1911 as Globe Electric, the company had invented the thin-wall, high-strength polypropylene battery case, a universally recognized breakthrough in battery design. 

​1985
Diversification at Johnson Controls continues with the acquisition of Hoover Universal (the source of its automotive seating and plastics machinery businesses), and automotive seating supplier Ferro Manufacturing. The acquisitions mean Johnson Controls can design, engineer and assemble complete automotive seating systems. 

​1985 - 2012 Global Leadership
Personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet change the world, while customer focus, globalization and outsourcing shape the business landscape. Johnson Controls achieves exceptional growth by remaining true to its core values of environmental stewardship, diversity and community support.
Entering the 21st century, the company adds business operations and customers worldwide. Its 130,000 employees provide products and services for more than 200 million vehicles, 12 million homes and one million commercial buildings—and lead the way into the future. 

1987
The first Johnson Controls just-in-time automotive facilities in Indiana, Illinois and Ontario deliver sequenced seats to factories within hours of receiving orders. The battery unit adds Honda, Mazda and Toyota as customers and is the first aftermarket parts maker to win Ford’s “Q1 Preferred Quality Award.” 

​1988
Jim Keyes becomes president. During his 14-year tenure, Johnson Controls becomes a major automotive supplier, the battery division rebuilds after losing Sears as a customer, the controls  division transitions from analog to digital, and overall sales increase six-fold. 

​1989
Johnson Controls enters facilities management by acquiring Pan Am World Services, renaming it Global Workplace Solutions, and initiates annual forums that attract speakers such as U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to discuss energy issues and climate change. 

​1990
The breakthrough Metasys® Building Automation System links a building’s environmental control, energy management, lighting, fire management and security systems. Johnson Controls enters the European automotive market by purchasing an interest in German component maker E.A.H. Naue GmbH & Co. KG. 

​1992
Johnson Controls achieves US$5.2 billion in sales. 

​1994
When Sears ends its relationship with Johnson Controls, company leaders respond by implementing best business practices that identify key metrics to drive performance and reduce costs companywide. All the lost business is replaced even before Sears returns as a customer two years later. 

​1996
Johnson Controls makes seats for more than eight million new automobiles, is listed in Industry Week Magazine’s “100 Best Managed Companies in The World,” acquires Prince Automotive and greatly expands its automotive interior systems business. Sales approach US$10 billion. 

1997
​Having been in plastics since acquiring Hoover Universal, Johnson Controls is the largest U.S. soft drink bottle supplier and recycler and the world leader in plastic manufacturing and recycling technology—but sells its container and plastics machinery divisions to focus on core products. Making seats for Beijing Jeep opens new markets in China. 

​1998
Johnson Controls ranks first among South America’s automotive seating suppliers, installs its 10,000th Metasys® Building Automation System and acquires the Becker Group, a European automotive interior supplier, and Cardkey integrated security solutions. 

1999
​The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star Buildings program names Johnson Controls “Ally of the Year.” The company also receives a General Motors “Supplier of the Year” award and the “Mandela International Award for Good Diversity Practices.” 

​2000
Johnson Controls acquires Japanese automobile seat supplier Ikeda Bussan and introduces the Auto Vision in-vehicle video system. The company’s Brengel Technology Center in Milwaukee is one of the first buildings in the world certified under Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design® (LEED). 

2001
​Terrorists crash a jetliner into the U.S. Pentagon on September 11, killing 64 passengers and 125 people inside in the resulting firestorm. The Pentagon facilities manager says a Johnson Controls building operations control center installed two months earlier let him close dampers to contain fire and smoke, potentially limiting further casualties. 

​2002
Johnson Controls acquires its Varta automotive battery division based in Germany. Sales exceed US$20 billion. John Barth is named the company's eighth CEO.

Johnson Controls keeps Circus Train running cool, July 13, 1986

On July 13, 1986, the Great Circus Parade was held in downtown Milwaukee. Before the parade could be staged, however, the wagons, equipment, and animals had to be transported to Milwaukee from their permanent home at the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis., via the Circus World Museum Train. 
The train was made up of a collection of 31 vintage railroad cars used in the past by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus to transport their circus across the country. Five of the train's cars were Pullman passenger cars each with a "Pullman Air Conditioning System." To make sure the passengers were comfortable on their 120-mile trip to Milwaukee, technicians from Johnson Controls' Madison branch were enlisted to check and service the system. 
The train's trip to Milwaukee for the parade was an event in itself as onlookers lined the tracks all along the route. The parade was first held in Milwaukee in 1963 and has been held there 30 times since – the last time being in 2009. The Circus World Museum, a National Historic Landmark site, opened to the public in 1959 on land where the Ringling Brothers founded their circus in 1884. Spread out over 30 buildings on 64 acres, the museum has one of the largest collections of circus artifacts in the world, including over 210 original wagons and vehicles used in the parade.

Johnson Controls International Plc is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Cork, Ireland[2] that produces automotive parts such as batteries and electronics and HVAC equipment for buildings. It employs 170,000 people in more than 1,300 locations across six continents. As of 2016[update] it was listed 242nd in the Fortune Global 500[3]; in 2017 it became ineligible for the Fortune 500, as it was headquartered outside the U.S.[4]
The company was formed via the merger of U.S. company Johnson Controls with Tyco International, announced on January 25, 2016. The merger led to the avoidance of U.S. taxes of its foreign market operations and a financial windfall for the CEO.[5][6]

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]
Global WorkPlace Solutions[edit]
The Global WorkPlace Solutions business unit provides outsourced facilities management services globally.[29] It also manages corporate real estate on behalf of its customers including acquiring and disposing of property, administering leases, and managing building related projects such as equipment replacements.[30] On September 23, 2015, CBRE, Inc. purchased the Global Workplace Solutions business unit, retaining the name "Global Workplace Solutions".[31]
Power Solutions[edit]
The Power Solutions business unit designs and manufactures automotive batteries for passenger cars, heavy and light duty trucks, utility vehicles, motorcycles, golf carts and boats.[19][32][33][34][35] It supplies more than one third of the world’s lead-acid batteries[36] to automakers and aftermarket retailers including Wal-Mart, Sears and BMW.[37][38][39] Lead acid battery brands produced under this business unit include OPTIMA, Heliar, LTH, and VARTA automotive batteries.[19] This part of the company also manufactures Lithium-ion cells and complete battery systems to power hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Ford Fusion[40] and Daimler’s S-Class 400.[41] Additionally, it manufactures Absorbent Glass Matt (AGM) and Enhanced Flooded Batteries (EFB) batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles such as the Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion.[19][36][42][43][44][45][46][47] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 60 locations worldwide.[19]
Automotive Experience[edit]
The Automotive Experience business unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers.[19][36] It is one of the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world.[48] The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.[51]
Joint ventures[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions (JCS) was a joint venture between Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft Groupe S.A..[52] It was officially launched in January 2006.[53]
Varta established a JCS development centre at its German HQ, following the setting-up of Varta-SAFT joint venture.[53]
Johnson Controls is exhibiting a plug-in hybrid concept called the re3. Johnson Controls produced cells for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in France under the joint venture with Saft. Battery assemblies were developed and produced in Hannover(Germany) and Milwaukee(USA)[54]
Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally.[55][56] In May 2011, the American company requested the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery.[55][56] The two companies agreed to the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.[57][58][59]

Johnson Controls International Plc is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Cork, Ireland[2] that produces automotive parts such as batteries and electronics and HVAC equipment for buildings. It employs 170,000 people in more than 1,300 locations across six continents. As of 2016[update] it was listed 242nd in the Fortune Global 500[3]; in 2017 it became ineligible for the Fortune 500, as it was headquartered outside the U.S.[4]
The company was formed via the merger of U.S. company Johnson Controls with Tyco International, announced on January 25, 2016. The merger led to the avoidance of U.S. taxes of its foreign market operations and a financial windfall for the CEO.[5][6]

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]
Global WorkPlace Solutions[edit]
The Global WorkPlace Solutions business unit provides outsourced facilities management services globally.[29] It also manages corporate real estate on behalf of its customers including acquiring and disposing of property, administering leases, and managing building related projects such as equipment replacements.[30] On September 23, 2015, CBRE, Inc. purchased the Global Workplace Solutions business unit, retaining the name "Global Workplace Solutions".[31]
Power Solutions[edit]
The Power Solutions business unit designs and manufactures automotive batteries for passenger cars, heavy and light duty trucks, utility vehicles, motorcycles, golf carts and boats.[19][32][33][34][35] It supplies more than one third of the world’s lead-acid batteries[36] to automakers and aftermarket retailers including Wal-Mart, Sears and BMW.[37][38][39] Lead acid battery brands produced under this business unit include OPTIMA, Heliar, LTH, and VARTA automotive batteries.[19] This part of the company also manufactures Lithium-ion cells and complete battery systems to power hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Ford Fusion[40] and Daimler’s S-Class 400.[41] Additionally, it manufactures Absorbent Glass Matt (AGM) and Enhanced Flooded Batteries (EFB) batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles such as the Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion.[19][36][42][43][44][45][46][47] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 60 locations worldwide.[19]
Automotive Experience[edit]
The Automotive Experience business unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers.[19][36] It is one of the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world.[48] The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.[51]
Joint ventures[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions (JCS) was a joint venture between Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft Groupe S.A..[52] It was officially launched in January 2006.[53]
Varta established a JCS development centre at its German HQ, following the setting-up of Varta-SAFT joint venture.[53]
Johnson Controls is exhibiting a plug-in hybrid concept called the re3. Johnson Controls produced cells for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in France under the joint venture with Saft. Battery assemblies were developed and produced in Hannover(Germany) and Milwaukee(USA)[54]
Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally.[55][56] In May 2011, the American company requested the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery.[55][56] The two companies agreed to the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.[57][58][59]
Other[edit]

Brookfield Johnson Controls is a joint venture with Brookfield Properties to provide commercial property management services in Canada. Established in 1992, it was known as Brookfield LePage Johnson Controls or BLJC until May 2015.

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]
Global WorkPlace Solutions[edit]
The Global WorkPlace Solutions business unit provides outsourced facilities management services globally.[29] It also manages corporate real estate on behalf of its customers including acquiring and disposing of property, administering leases, and managing building related projects such as equipment replacements.[30] On September 23, 2015, CBRE, Inc. purchased the Global Workplace Solutions business unit, retaining the name "Global Workplace Solutions".[31]
Power Solutions[edit]
The Power Solutions business unit designs and manufactures automotive batteries for passenger cars, heavy and light duty trucks, utility vehicles, motorcycles, golf carts and boats.[19][32][33][34][35] It supplies more than one third of the world’s lead-acid batteries[36] to automakers and aftermarket retailers including Wal-Mart, Sears and BMW.[37][38][39] Lead acid battery brands produced under this business unit include OPTIMA, Heliar, LTH, and VARTA automotive batteries.[19] This part of the company also manufactures Lithium-ion cells and complete battery systems to power hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Ford Fusion[40] and Daimler’s S-Class 400.[41] Additionally, it manufactures Absorbent Glass Matt (AGM) and Enhanced Flooded Batteries (EFB) batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles such as the Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion.[19][36][42][43][44][45][46][47] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 60 locations worldwide.[19]
Automotive Experience[edit]
The Automotive Experience business unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers.[19][36] It is one of the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world.[48] The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.[51]
Joint ventures[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions (JCS) was a joint venture between Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft Groupe S.A..[52] It was officially launched in January 2006.[53]
Varta established a JCS development centre at its German HQ, following the setting-up of Varta-SAFT joint venture.[53]
Johnson Controls is exhibiting a plug-in hybrid concept called the re3. Johnson Controls produced cells for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in France under the joint venture with Saft. Battery assemblies were developed and produced in Hannover(Germany) and Milwaukee(USA)[54]
Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally.[55][56] In May 2011, the American company requested the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery.[55][56] The two companies agreed to the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.[57][58][59]
Other[edit]

Brookfield Johnson Controls is a joint venture with Brookfield Properties to provide commercial property management services in Canada. Established in 1992, it was known as Brookfield LePage Johnson Controls or BLJC until May 2015. In 2013, Johnson Controls and Brookfield Asset Management formed a similar joint venture Australia and New Zealand.[60]

In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
