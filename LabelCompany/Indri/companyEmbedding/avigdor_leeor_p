Michael G. Mullen
Senior Advisor


Admiral Mike Mullen is a senior advisor of Providence and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States government’s principal military advisor.  Considered perhaps one of the most influential chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in history, Admiral Mullen takes a fresh approach to the most important issues of the 21st century—including America's global positioning and how business trends and the economic health of the U.S. directly impact our national security.
Admiral Mullen was widely recognized as an “honest broker” in his key leadership roles as the top military advisor to two presidents—Barack Obama and George W. Bush— as well as to the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council. He continues to maintain strong relationships with leaders around the globe. He led the military during a critical period of transition, overseeing the end of the combat mission in Iraq and the development of a new military strategy for Afghanistan. He advocated for the rapid development and fielding of innovative technologies, championed emerging and enduring international partnerships, and advanced new methods for combating terrorism—all of which directly culminated in the elimination of Osama bin Laden. As the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs to have attended Harvard Business School’s executive program, Admiral Mullen sought the advice of economists, entrepreneurs, non-profit practitioners and even embraced social media both to inform himself and strengthen ties between the U.S. military and the nation. In an unprecedented in-depth feature article, Fast Company, called Admiral Mullen “not just a new model for military officers—and a new kind of business titan—but also a case study in 21st-century leadership.” Prior to becoming chairman, Admiral Mullen served as the 28th Chief of Naval Operations.  Prior to that, he served in leadership positions at the Naval Academy, in the Navy's Bureau of Personnel, in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and on the Navy Staff. He was the 32nd Vice Chief of Naval Operations.
Today he shares with audiences his deep experience in leading change in complex organizations, executive development and succession planning, diversity implementation, crisis management, strategic planning, budget policy, congressional relations, risk management, technical innovation and cyber security.
Admiral Mullen is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School, received a Master of Science in Operations Research from the Naval Postgraduate School and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968.

Komen Greater NYC Race for the CureThank you for visiting my personal webpage. Please support my participation in the Komen Greater NYC Race for the Cure and donate today!On Sunday, September 18, 2011 the Greater New York City Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure will be holding its 21st annual 5K run/walk — the Komen Greater NYC Race for the Cure — its premier fundraiser.On that day well over 21,000 New Yorkers, including more than 1,600 breast cancer survivors, will come together to run breast cancer out of town.Why is this important? One in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. In 2010, it was estimated that 207,000 women and nearly 2,000 men were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. An estimated 40,000 women and 400 men died from the disease.Last year, the Komen Greater NYC Race for the Cure raised over $5.4 million, which allowed us to fund a record-breaking $4.8 million in grants to local breast health education, screening and treatment programs and national research to find the cures. All donations are tax deductible.With your help, this year's Race will be even more successful, and Komen Greater NYC will be able to award more grants in 2012.I need your support! Please give as generously as you can see every dollar counts and no donation is too small. Together, we can create a world without breast cancer.
