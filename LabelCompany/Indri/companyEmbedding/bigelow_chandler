Special Memories
Mission Statement
Tea Time with Cindi






	“We’ve been making tea for three generations, and we get better every year.”David Bigelow

	Ruth Campbell Bigelow

 Ruth Campbell Bigelow had been a designer by trade. In 1945, inspired by an early Colonial recipe and dissatisfied with the commodity tea that was commonplace in the 1940s, Ruth focused her creative energies on formulating a better cup of tea in the kitchen of her New York City brownstone. After weeks of trial and error, blending black tea with orange rind and sweet spices, she emerged with the first cup of specialty tea in the country. Ruth shared her tea with friends and received many comments—in fact, “constant comments.” Her new brew got its name, and the Bigelow Tea Company was born.
	 

	David E. Bigelow, Sr.  

 David E. Bigelow, also known as David Sr. started his career in publishing.  He later moved into the brokerage business later in life where he sold various foods which would help in his partnership with Ruth when they started the Bigelow Tea business.
	After Bigelow Tea was formed, David oversaw all the finances, ensuring that he and Ruth watched their pennies so that the fledgling business could survive.  He outlived his wife, Ruth Campbell by a few years and carried the same strong work ethic as Ruth. David Sr. came to the office every day and worked side by side with his son, David Jr. until right before his passing in 1970 at the age of 91.

	Eunice and David Bigelow, Co-Chairmen

  While the company can attribute its beginnings to David Bigelow’s mother and the advent of Constant Comment in 1945, it was David and Eunice who pioneered the explosion in variety teas that Americans enjoy today.  David, with the unwavering support of his wife Eunice, lead the company with integrity, passion, intelligence, kindness and a spirit of determination to its current prominence as the country’s #1 specialty tea company.

	Their idea to launch specialty tea to mass market through grocery channels in the 1970s changed the company’s direction in profound ways and paved the way for the future of tea in the U.S. Another notable milestone in their luminous careers was the development of the foil pouch that has become the accepted industry standard for protecting tea’s freshness and flavor from ambient influences. 

	Today, as co-chairmen of the family-run company, they continue to personally taste and approve the blends for the 120 different teas the company now produces. And much to their credit, they made a considerable investment in the preservation of the Charleston Tea Plantation in South Carolina, saving it from the developer’s wrecking ball and restoring it to its former grandeur as America’s only working tea farms. The farm’s visitor center documents the tea growing, harvesting and withering processes, giving over 60,000 people who visit annually a new-found appreciation for this remarkable beverage.

	Cindi Bigelow

 Before assuming her role as the third generation president and CEO of family-owned Bigelow Tea in 2005, Cindi Bigelow spent 20 years in virtually all areas of the company that her grandmother founded. Cindi is instrumental in expanding Bigelow Tea into new channels while building awareness and brand engagement across social media—all to ensure Bigelow Tea is accessible everywhere, 24/7.

	As passionate as she is about producing the finest cup of tea, Cindi is equally concerned about community and sustainability issues. She initiated the Annual Bigelow Tea Community Challenge that has donated over $1 million to local charities and participates in volunteer projects that include Habitat for Humanity’s Adopt-a-Home program. Under her leadership, the company was one of the first in Connecticut to install solar panels to offset energy usage, and she has implemented other innovations that have earned Bigelow Tea the distinction of being a Zero Waste to Landfill company.

	Cindi holds a bachelor’s degree from Boston College, MBA from Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management and Honorary Doctorates from Fairfield University and the University of New Haven.  She frequently makes appearances speaking to students and industry leaders, sharing insights on business ethics and career development and has received numerous awards for her years of community service. Favorite pastimes include being with her children, skiing, tennis, yoga and drinking lots of tea.
	 

	Lori Bigelow

 Lori Bigelow grew up in a family that specializes in developing tea. She earned her degree at Keene State College before joining the family business, Bigelow Tea, where she learned the nuances of making specialty teas including a sense of blending, sipping, tasting and tweaking which ultimately led to the development of some of Bigelow’s favorite and best loved teas. The seasonal favorite Ginger Snappish®, Vanilla Chai and the Novus line are just a few of many of the blends she created.  Before retiring, was on the board of the U.S. Tea Association and a former member of the Canadian Tea Association. She was instrumental in the Bigelow Tea’s purchase and restoration of the Charleston Tea Plantation.  The South Carolina Plantation grows and produces American Classic Tea and is open for tours and weddings.

	Green Tea

FRESH, SMOOTH AND, WELL, GREEN






Green Tea comes from Camellia sinensis leaves that are immediately steamed or pan-fired rather than being exposed to air so that no oxidation occurs.   This special handling makes for a more delicate brew that is typically lower in caffeine than black and Oolong teas.  Although amounts vary, green teas are highest in polyphenols known as EGCG, which is why so many make it part of their healthy lifestyle.

      Packed Perfectly Fine
  

      by Bryon  from Midland, TX on 10/29/2016 3:40:38 PM
  




      I guess I'm not enough of a tea snob to be affected by the 4 to a pouch packaging.  First bag tastes fine, last bag tastes fine.  I have large hands, very large hands, and I have no problem pulling a single bag out of the pouch and putting two folds in the pouch to re-seal it until I use a subsequent bag.  Not sure what all the commotion is about.  I know at my neighborhood grocery store the option to purchase the 4 pack or the individual pack is available.  If you don't like the 4 pack, just buy the single.  Great product.  Appreciate you.

      "We use a special foil pouch to protect your tea from any air, moisture and surrounding aromas. So open and enjoy the unparalleled flavor, freshness, and aroma of Bigelow Tea everywhere you go!"

REALLY?!?!?!?! Fresh for the first tea bag, but what about the other three that you have to cram back into the the little "shared" foil pouch???? Goodbye flavor, freshness and aroma!!!!!! I used to throw 1-2 bags in my purse to have on hand and now I can't because I'm afraid the pouch will open up and I will loose the extra bag and have them rip open. Goodbye protection!!!! I won't be buying again until this has changed!!!! HORRIBLE IDEA!!!!
  


      Awful Repackaging - 4 Bags Per Foil Pouch
  

      by J from Phoenix on 2/23/2016 2:29:14 PM
  




      I can only assume repackaging the tea to four tea bags per individually sealed foil pouch vs. each tea bag in it's own individually sealed pouch was a cost saving measure.  But I won't repurchase unless the packaging returns to each tea bag in it's own, individual pouch.  I see numerous complaints about this and many saying it has impacted flavor.  Flavor aside, I don't drink four cups of tea a day, and there is no way to reseal the pouch after you open it.  So the idea they are sealed for freshness is ruined if you don't use the tea bags immediately.  This was a really bad idea.  
  


      Horrible Pouches
  

      by Doug from Ocala on 12/23/2015 6:07:57 PM
  




      The pouches with 4 bags sucks.  I'm being kind.  Pull out one and another trails it.  Can't get it back.  Doesn't seal.  Stupid Product Manager conned one on the Marketing and Product VP.

  


      Don't really like the change
  

      by Tersa from Ft Worth on 7/13/2015 7:08:11 PM
  




      Not sure if it is the bag or the tea.  Flavor is noticeably weaker.  Wish you would change it back.

      Not happy with new bags
  

      by Shane from Chandler on 4/3/2015 11:54:39 AM
  




      4 tea bags to the pack in the 40 box.  New white, gauze-like tea bags are terrible.  They don't steep very well.
