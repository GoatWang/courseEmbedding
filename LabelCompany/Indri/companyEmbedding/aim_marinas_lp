Service Tips

Do you know which guage is the most important to have in your boat's dash?If you said water pressure 
        guage then you are correct. A water pressure guage gives you almost instant feedback that your motor is cooling and has 
        proper water flow through the powerhead.

DALLAS, Jan. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Safe Harbor Marinas, a company formed in 2015 and backed by American Infrastructure MLP Funds (AIM), will make its formal debut as the largest owner and operator of marinas in the United States this week at the International Marina and Boatyard Conference. The company recently completed acquisitions from four separate marina owners and operators and has plans to aggressively grow through future acquisitions.
Safe Harbor Marinas' management team is comprised of industry veterans with an average of 30 years of marina experience. The company is committed to operational excellence and to delivering the highest level of customer service to its boating community and marina members.  Safe Harbor currently owns/manages 31 marinas across 12 states totaling over 20,000 wet and dry slips, and is currently processing additional acquisitions in its pipeline. The company is looking to selectively acquire coastal and inland marinas, either through the acquisition of whole portfolios or select individual properties. The company expects to deploy over $500 million of capital in acquisitions through its equity and debt commitments. In certain situations, the company will consider bringing in marina owners as equity partners.
"We have created a brand and strategy that will benefit marina owners, operators and the boating community in both the short term and the long term," said Marshall Funk, CEO of Safe Harbor Marinas. "As a result of our scale, all of our properties will benefit from additional revenue and cost saving opportunities."
"With the launch of the newly formed Safe Harbor Marinas, we have created the nation's largest owner and operator of marinas," said Ryan Barnes, managing director for AIM. "We are focused on the numerous opportunities in this sector and have a strategy to create a lasting partnership in the marina industry."
The International Marina and Boatyard Conference will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Jan. 27-29. Safe Harbor Marinas will be located in booths 838/840. 
About Safe Harbor MarinasSafe Harbor Marinas is the largest owner and operator of marinas in the United States. Based in Dallas, the company is dedicated to providing the highest standards of excellence in customer service across its portfolio of inland and coastal properties.

Details



Deltaville Marina is a full service marina situated just minutes from the Chesapeake Bay. Located on Virginia's beautiful Jackson Creek, our serene resort-like setting offers boaters all the modern day amenities. We are open year round and provide slip holders and transient visitors a quiet family-oriented environment. Jackson Creek, positioned between the Rappahannock and Piankatank Rivers, offers two branches both with deep water and quiet, protected anchorages. The shore is lined with beautiful residential homes and osprey nests. We are approximately one mile to the quaint and historic town of Deltaville. This lovely Chesapeake Bay marina is just a hop, skip and a jump to the Deltaville Maritime Museum which offers a unique look at the area once considered the boat-building capital of the Bay!
