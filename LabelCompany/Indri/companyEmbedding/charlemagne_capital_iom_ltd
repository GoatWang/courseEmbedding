Our investment team lies at the heart of our business.
We have a highly qualified investment team of more than 20, all focusing on emerging and frontier markets with an average of over 20 years’ experience.
The investment team is based in London, sitting together in a single office when not out on the road undertaking company visits. This breeds a collegiate atmosphere that supports the sharing of best practice, encourages a ready flow of investment ideas, facilitates peer review, and helps to ensure all portfolios meet the same high standards.
Individual team members have extensive experience and knowledge of emerging markets, with most having spent their entire careers in the asset class. The team also benefits from its diversity, with members drawn from across the globe and speaking more than 12 languages.
