Tweet








10/31/2006 10:34:10 AM



    DENVER, Oct. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- ARCA Discovery, Inc., a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing genetically-targeted therapies for heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases, today announced the appointment of Thomas A. Keuer, as Executive Vice President of Pharmaceutical Operations. Mr. Keuer has over twenty five years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries at Insmed Inc., Baxter International, Somatogen, and Monsanto.  Most recently, he served as Senior Vice President, Insmed Therapeutic Proteins with responsibility for all aspects of the Therapeutic Protein Manufacturing Program and Boulder site.  Prior to that, he held the position of Vice President of Engineering for the Biosciences Division of Baxter International. Mr. Keuer received his Masters of Science in Biochemical Engineering from Rice University as a Monsanto-sponsored delegate.
    In making the announcement, ARCA's President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Michael R. Bristow said, "We are very pleased to have Tom Keuer join the ARCA team.  He brings to the Company the operational expertise, experienced leadership and knowledge in Chemistry, Manufacturing & Controls that we need to meet the regulatory challenges of drug development, and prepare for commercialization of our lead product, bucindolol."
    "I believe that ARCA's approach for development of targeted, optimized therapies for cardiovascular disease will represent a major advancement in personalized medicine.  I look forward to working with the ARCA team to commercialize bucindolol and provide this important therapy to the patients who need it," said Mr. Keuer.
    About ARCA Discovery, Inc.
    ARCA Discovery, Inc. is a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing genetically-targeted therapies for heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases.  The Company's first product is bucindolol, a third generation beta-blocker-vasodilator for advanced heart failure and other indications, that promises to be the first genetically-targeted cardiovascular drug.  Bucindolol has extensive Phase III data and a unique Phase III DNA sub-study.  Using this sub-study, ARCA's founding scientists have confirmed two genetic polymorphisms that interact with bucindolol's unique pharmacology to modify patient response.  ARCA is preparing an NDA for bucindolol and intends to seek FDA approval of bucindolol during 2007.
