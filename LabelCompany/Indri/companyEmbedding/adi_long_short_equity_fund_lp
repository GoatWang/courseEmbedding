 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

  Products & Performance  Long/Short Hedge Fund










Long/Short Hedge Fund



The Tech Bust. The Global Financial Crisis. The Crescat Long/Short Hedge Fund strongly outperformed during two of the worst bear markets in history. Investors in the Long/Short Fund value the fund’s strong risk-adjusted returns, achieved with a focus on long and short equities.

Crescat Capital LLC manages hedge funds and separate accounts through its wholly owned subsidiary, Crescat Portfolio Management LLC, an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Registration as an investment adviser does not imply a certain level of skill or training.
Crescat Portfolio Management claims compliance with Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). Prospective clients can obtain a compliant presentation and the firm’s list of composite descriptions by contacting Crescat by phone at (303) 271-9997, or by visiting our website at www.crescat.net/resources/due-diligence/. Returns are presented net of management fees and performance fees. The currency used to express performance is U.S. dollars.
Strategy and Composite Description
The Crescat Long/Short Hedge Fund Composite includes all accounts that are managed according to the firm’s long/short equity hedge fund strategy over which the manager has full discretion. This hedge fund strategy strives to grow and protect client capital through an actively-managed, prudently-diversified, long-biased, long/short equity portfolio comprised of liquid large- and mid-cap global equities. The manager follows a multi-disciplinary, value-based investment process with risk controls. The strategy blends top-down, macroeconomic analysis with bottom-up, fundamental valuation. The investment team’s macroeconomic analysis includes the valuation of currencies, commodities, industries, and markets in order to develop global macroeconomic investment themes that are expressed in the strategy through long and short equity positions. The manager may trade and invest in individual equities as well as exchange-traded funds and related options. The strategy employs a moderate amount of leverage within constraints based on the investment team’s assessment of market risks and opportunities. The strategy’s bottom-up approach to equity valuation starts with a proprietary, fundamental, quantitative model that was originally built in 1997 by the firm’s Chief Investment Officer, Kevin C. Smith, CFA. The model applies an innovative and robust discounted-free-cash-flow methodology to produce daily valuations of the top 2,000 largest and most-liquid global equities that trade on a U.S. exchange. The fundamental quant model has been consistently refined and applied to managing this strategy since its inception. The investment team performs additional qualitative analysis to validate buy and sell signals generated by the model and to integrate model-driven ideas with the firm’s macro themes. The goal of the strategy is to generate high risk-adjusted returns as measured by top-decile Alpha, Sortino Ratio, Omega Ratio, and Gain-Loss Ratio that are in the top 10% of all global hedge fund managers over the long term whose strategy is predominantly long/short equity.
Benchmark Descriptions
The S&P 500 Index is perhaps the most commonly followed stock market index. It is considered representative of the US stock market at large. It is a market-cap-weighted index of the 500 largest and most liquid companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. While the companies are U.S. based, most of them have broad global operations. Therefore, the index is representative of the broad global economy. It is a suitable benchmark for the Crescat Long/Short Hedge Fund Composite which has also traded extensively in large, highly-liquid global equities through U.S.-listed securities.
The HFRX Equity Hedge Index represents an investable index of hedge funds that trade both long and short in global equity securities. Managers of funds in the index employ a wide variety of investment processes. They may be broadly diversified or narrowly focused on specific sectors and can range broadly in terms of levels of net exposure, leverage employed, holding period, concentrations of market capitalizations and valuation ranges of typical portfolios. It is a suitable benchmark for Crescat Long/Short Fund because it has also been predominantly composed of long and short global equities since inception.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
