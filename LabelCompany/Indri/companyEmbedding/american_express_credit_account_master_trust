                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The Receivables existing in the Initial Accounts at the close of

III on the Closing Date. Receivables arising after the Closing Date

respect to any Account during the term of this Agreement unless and

the conveyance of Centurion’s right, title and interest in
and to the Purchased Assets shall constitute an absolute sale,
conveying good title free and clear of any liens, claims,
encumbrances or rights of others, from Centurion to RFC III. It is
the intention of the parties hereto that the arrangements with
respect to the Purchased Assets shall constitute a purchase and
sale of such Purchased Assets and not a loan, including for
accounting purposes. In the event, however, that it were to be
determined that the transactions evidenced hereby constitute a loan
and not a purchase and sale, it is the intention of the parties
hereto that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement
under applicable law, and that Centurion shall be deemed to have
granted, and Centurion does hereby grant, to RFC III a first
priority perfected security interest in all of Centurion’s
right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
in, to and under the Purchased Assets to secure the obligations of
Centurion hereunder.

(e) To the extent that Centurion
retains any interest in the Purchased Assets, Centurion hereby
grants to the Trustee a security interest in all of
Centurion’s right, title and interest, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, in, to and under the Purchased Assets, to
secure the performance of all of the obligations of Centurion
hereunder and under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. With
respect to such security interest and such collateral, the Trustee
shall have all of the rights that it has under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement. The Trustee shall also have all of the rights
of a secured creditor under the UCC.

(f) Centurion hereby acknowledges
and agrees to perform its obligations under Section 2.01 of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

(g) Each Account will continue to be
owned by Centurion and is not a Purchased Asset.

(h) By executing this Agreement,
each of Centurion and RFC III acknowledges and agrees that
(i) on and after the date of this Agreement, all references to
the Original Agreement in any other instruments or documents shall
be deemed to constitute references to this Agreement, and
(ii) all outstanding representations, warranties and covenants
made by it in the Original Agreement and any of its existing
obligations under the Original Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect under this Agreement, as amended and
restated.

Extended Warranty♦
Why is it that as soon as a manufacturer's warranty runs out, something always seems to happen? When you use your American Express® Card for eligible purchases, you can get up to one extra year added to the original manufacturer's warranty. Applies to warranties of 5 years or less. Please read important exclusions and restrictions.
Purchase Protection♦
When something you buy breaks or is stolen, Purchase Protection♦ can have you covered. Use your Card for eligible purchases, and your purchases can be protected from accidental damage or theft for up to 90 days from the moment you buy them. Please read important exclusions and restrictions.
Return Protection‡
If you try to return an eligible item within 90 days from the date of purchase and the merchant won't take it back, American Express may refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling), up to &dollar;300 per item, up to a maximum of &dollar;1,000 per calendar year per Card account, if you purchased it entirely with your eligible American Express® Card. Please read important exclusions and restrictions.‡
Dispute Resolution‡
If there is a fraudulent or incorrect charge on your statement, American Express will work with you to help resolve the issue.‡
