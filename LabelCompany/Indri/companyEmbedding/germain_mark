            I loved the pictures and the story!  I bought it for my eight  year old granddaughter but I enjoy it too!  I wish this book had been available when my children were young.  It's not too wordy and teaches the value of money management in a brief colorful presentation that will hold a child's attention.

            Three Cups: By Tony Townsley and Mark St. Germain Illustrated by April Willy


Excellent teaching tool with a great story for all age children


The expression on the Childs face encourages you to really feel the moment he receives his gift from his perspective. This story is about the gift of three cups given to the author by his parents. One cup is for giving, one is for saving and one for spending. This is a great teaching tool for a Christian parent who wants to instill the value in a child to give and save money. I was disappointed that in the kindle addition you could not see the illustrations while reading the pages as they were on separate pages. What was thought to be the worst gift ever at first site turned out to be a gift that lasted a life time and could be passed on for generations to come. I would recommend this book to anyone who has children. The book is great for my girls ages 10 and 12 as well as my boys 5 and 7. I read it to my 1 and 2 year olds also though they are not quite old enough to understand. It is never too young to start learning about money. another negative about this book was that it did not have bible verses nor did it talk about tithing in reference to giving. You could incorporate that into a lesson using this book but it was not in it and I felt it should have been. I give it a 4 star rating only because of the lack of biblical reference.

            I got the e-book version of Three Cups to review directly from the publisher at Booksneeze.com. I did like the illustrations even on the e-book version, however, I was a little bit disappointed by the simplicity of the book. I'm not sure if it's because I already am aware of the idea of breaking your finances up into three cups, or if I wanted a little more "story" along with the instructions. I have actually tried the concept in the past with my children and had little luck. Every single one of them ended up "playing" with the cups -- dumping the money out and stacking it up...and I found it very hard to pay the children with the three cup method. For example, you cannot give a child a $5 bill, or a $1 bill... you have to give him a sum that is able to be broken up according to your spending habits. So maybe my experiences colored my view of the book in a negative light. It is beautifully illustrated but overly simplistic. I'd like to see somewhere in the back some information on how to make this work in the real world.

            Teaching children to use their money wisely is very important. Three Cups provides a simple way to explain saving, sharing and spending to children. A five year old boy receives three cups from his parents on his birthday. His parents explain that they will give him an allowance and each week they will help him put of the money in each of the three cups. After a while, he has collected enough money to start a savings account in the bank, buy the baseball glove he wants (plus a gift for his sister), and help out some people in need.


The story format is very simple, and is actually very similar to the way my parents taught me when I was little. A good choice for parents to share with their children.


Tommy Nelson provided this book for review through the BookSneeze review program.

            How exciting! I really enjoyed this book - Three Cups, by Tony Townsley with Mark St. Germain. It is a super short read, only 32 pages - but it was great! We are going to read it to our kids tonight and it has inspired me to want to try this tradition and teaching tool with them.


Three cups is a wonderful story about a family's tradition to teach their young five year old son about a grand adventure! Using three cups, the reader follows this young boy as he divides his weekly allowance between the three cups - Saving, Spending and Giving. Throughout the story the parents encourage their son and instill a sense of value, for work, money and giving. With a little more discussion, this could have been an A+ book. The only thing I would have liked to have seen is what the Lord has to say about money, giving, spending and saving. Overall though, it is a sound way to encourage our youth to be responsible and teach the value of money management - patterns that can - if followed through with - will last a lifetime. Don't hesitate in getting this cute book for your kids!


God Bless!
