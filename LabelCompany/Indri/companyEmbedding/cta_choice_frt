This guide will teach you how to create a CTA in HubSpot that is attractive, compelling, and effective. For more on why you should be using CTAs across your website, blog, and email content, and the best practices for using CTAs, check out our Call-to-Action Best Practices article.




















LOG IN TO YOUR
HUBSPOT CTA TOOL













    Instructions
  
Follow these steps to learn how to create an effective CTA.











    1. Content > Calls-to-Action
  
From your Dashboard, go to Content and then select the Calls-to-Action tool.












    2. Select Create a CTA
  
Select the Create a CTA button on the right side of the page.












    3. Name your CTA
  
In the first box of the Information tab, give your CTA a name. This is not the text that will appear on the actual CTA; it is just an internal name that you use to organize your CTAs.












    4. Select a campaign
  
From the dropdown menu, choose a campaign with which you would like to associate your CTA. To create a new campaign, click the Add new... button.












    5. Enter the link for the CTA
  
Now decide if you want your CTA to link to a web address or to one of your website pages. Make your selection in the Link to dropdown menu. If you choose to link to a web address, then simply put the address in the Link URL box below.











If you choose to link your CTA to one of your HubSpot-hosted website pages, click on the Your pages option. Select a page in the Redirect to Page drop-down menu. From here, you can easily choose a page by scrolling through or searching within the drop-down menu. Once you select a page, the address will automatically fill the Link URL box.











You also have the option to have the link URL of your CTA open in a separate window after the CTA is clicked on. To do so, check the box next to Open in new window. This feature is usually used when your CTA links to a page that is not on the same domain.






If you want to link your CTA to a file, you can enter the file URL in the Destination URL box. You can retrieve the URL of a file in File Manager. Read this article to learn how to get the file URL.











    6. Select the button type
  
Go to the Design tab at the top of the Create CTA window. Select the type of button that you prefer. If you want to design your button using the options that HubSpot gives you in the tool, select Custom Button. If you want to use a custom image for your CTA, select Image Button. This example will show you how to create a custom button CTA in the HubSpot CTA design tool. If you want to learn how to create a CTA using a custom image, read this guide.












    7. Select the button style
  
Using the dropdown menu, choose a style for your button.












    8. Select a background color
  
Choose a background color for your button. You can either type in an HTML color code or you can use the gradient to find a color. Once you have chosen a color, click the Done button.












    9. Select a button size
  
The button size is automatically set. If you wish to set the size, uncheck the Size Automatically box and adjust the width and height boxes with dimensions of your choice.











Adjust width and height
If you want to choose a custom width and height, enter the dimensions you desire.












    10. Customize CSS on your button
  
If you would like to create custom CSS for your button, click the Customize CSS button.











Create custom CSS
A new CSS tab will open in which you can easily create a CSS class and write custom CSS. All of your changes will be updated live in the CTA preview. The auto generated CSS based on your selected CTA style will render in the left column.
If you would like to return to the default HubSpot design, click on the Reset to default button. Your original design will be saved.











You can either add properties directly to the Custom CSS field, or write full CSS selectors, as depicted below. This allows you to customize hover effects and other CTA states. For complete control over the styling of your CTA, you'll want to choose the Plain Link button style and use CSS to style the entire button.












    11. Write your CTA button's text
  
In the text edit box in the Design tab, write the copy of your CTA. Use the Edit and Style menus to choose the font and to style the text.
Keep the CTA best practices in mind as you write your text.
Here are a few more tips to get you started:

To make the text multi-line, hit the enter key on your keyboard
The CTA text is automatically used as the alt text for your button (only with default button styles)
If you want to add symbols to your text, you can use HTML













    12. Create your CTA
  
When you are  ready to finish creating your CTA, click on the Create CTA button to complete your striking, wonderful CTA.












    13. Review your new CTA
  
Now you can see your CTA in your CTA dashboard. You can change the name of the CTA by clicking the name of the CTA or pencil icon.











This is also where you can edit, clone, create a test variation, or remove your CTA entirely. These options are available under the gear icon. To review the features of the CTA dashboard, read this article.
