Is it Time to Tackle Inbound Freight?


Posted by Alan Dunkerley in General Logistics, Logistics Technology, Routing, Mobile & Telematics, Transportation Management on Jan 10, 2017 
Advanced TMS Capabilities Open Up New OpportunitiesIn speaking with customers over the last few months, we have seen a significant increase in transportation teams taking more control of their inbound freight. Historically, most of the return on investment (ROI) for transportation management systems (TMS) was focused on outbound transportation by optimizing across less than truckload (LTL)/truckload (TL) and cutting freight costs while creating increased visibility and customer service. Now, with the advent of cloud-based transportation management systems that support a wider range of modes (e.g. parcel, fleet, air and ocean) and better supplier connectivity, the opportunity to expand the use of TMS to reduce the cost of inbound shipments is greater than ever.

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

Global Logistics Network[edit]
Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]
In 2012, Waterstone Human Capital named Descartes to its list of Canada’s 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures in the “Mid-Market” category.[70][71]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

Global Logistics Network[edit]
Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]
In 2012, Waterstone Human Capital named Descartes to its list of Canada’s 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures in the “Mid-Market” category.[70][71]

Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

Global Logistics Network[edit]
Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]
In 2012, Waterstone Human Capital named Descartes to its list of Canada’s 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures in the “Mid-Market” category.[70][71]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

Global Logistics Network[edit]
Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]
In 2012, Waterstone Human Capital named Descartes to its list of Canada’s 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures in the “Mid-Market” category.[70][71]

            Company Profile
          
                Descartes (TSX: DSG) (NASDAQ: DSGX) uses technology and networks to simplify complex business processes. We are primarily focused on logistics and supply chain management business processes. Our solutions are predominantly cloud-based and are focused on improving the productivity, performance and security of logistics-intensive businesses. Customers use our modular, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions to route, schedule, track and measure delivery resources; plan, allocate and execute shipments; rate, audit and pay transportation invoices; access and leverage global trade and restricted party data; file customs and security documents for imports and exports; research and perform trade tariff and duty calculations and complete numerous other logistics processes by participating in a large, collaborative multi-modal logistics community. Our pricing model provides our customers with flexibility in purchasing our solutions either on a subscription, transactional or perpetual license basis. Our primary focus is on serving transportation providers (air, ocean and truck modes), logistics service providers (including third-party logistics providers, freight forwarders and customs brokers) and distribution-intensive companies for which delivery is either a key or a defining part of their own product or service offering, or for which our solutions provide an opportunity to reduce costs and improve service levels by optimizing the use of their assets.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]
Acquisitions going back to 2006 are listed below.

Global Logistics Network[edit]
Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]
In 2012, Waterstone Human Capital named Descartes to its list of Canada’s 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures in the “Mid-Market” category.[70][71]

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (commonly referred to as Descartes) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses.
Descartes is perhaps best known for its abrupt and unexpected turnaround in the mid-2000s after coming close to bankruptcy in the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse. It is also known as one of the earliest logistics technology companies to adopt an on-demand business model and sell its software as a service (SaaS) via the Internet. The company operates the Global Logistics Network, an extensive electronic messaging system used by freight companies, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, customs brokers, government agencies, and other interested parties to exchange logistics and customs information.
Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Descartes is a publicly traded company with shares listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ: DSGX) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: DSG). It has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

History[edit]
Descartes was founded in 1981.[2]
In 1998, the company made an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange,[3] where its common shares trade under the stock symbol DSG.[4] Descartes was first listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1999,[3] with common shares trading under the symbol DSGX.[5] Descartes’ share price peaked during the dot-com bubble and then fell precipitously in the subsequent crash.[3][6]
In 2001, Descartes switched its business model from selling full-featured enterprise software licenses to providing on-demand software on a subscription basis, becoming one of the first SaaS providers in the logistics sector.[7][8][9] After years of losses, Descartes came close to bankruptcy in 2004,[6][7] prompting it to aggressively restructure.[10][11] The company cut 35% of its workforce[12] and initiated a sweeping transformation of its corporate culture.[6][13][14]
The company returned to profitability in 2005,[15] pulling off what one analyst later described as “one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian corporate history.”[14] Descartes was recognized for this achievement at the 2006 International Business Awards gala, held in New York City.[16]
In December, 2013, Descartes was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index, an index of the stock (equity) prices of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[17]
By January, 2015, Descartes had posted 41 straight profitable quarters[18] and was supplying logistics software and services to more than 10,000 logistics-centric businesses,[19] such as ground transportation companies, airlines, ocean carriers, freight forwarders, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Its customers included American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Maersk Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Con-way, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL International, The Home Depot, Sears Brands, Hallmark Cards, Hasbro, Volvo, Ferrellgas, Del Monte, and The Coca-Cola Company.[19]
In 2016, Gartner ranked Descartes 6th in its list of the Top 20 Supply Chain Management Software Suppliers, based on revenue of $146 million.[26]
Acquisitions[edit]
Acquisitions have played a key role in Descartes’ growth.[27][8][19][28][29] By acquiring niche technology companies, Descartes has expanded its line of logistics software and services, enlarged its customer base, and extended its business geographically.[7][19][30][31][32]

Global Logistics Network[edit]
Descartes’ cloud-based logistics messaging system, the Global Logistics Network (GLN), connects more than 13,000 customers in over 160 countries,[24][29] making it one of the world’s largest logistics networks.[19] Each year, the GLN carries more than 4.5 billion messages and manages more than 30 million shipping routes.[64]
Companies use the network to oversee shipping orders, file customs paperwork, comply with security regulations, share information across international supply chains, and automate logistics processes.[7][19][25][65][66] In 2015, Descartes signed a deal with German business software giant SAP SE that allows users of SAP’s transportation management software to access the GLN.[65]
Conference[edit]
Descartes holds an annual logistics technology conference for its users and partners. The eleventh Descartes “Evolution” conference was held in 2016.[67]
Awards[edit]
Descartes won the Stevie Award for Best Business Turnaround at the International Business Awards in 2006.[16][68] Canadian Business Magazine also awarded Descartes an honorary Stevie for being the most notable Canadian entry.[69]
In 2012, Waterstone Human Capital named Descartes to its list of Canada’s 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures in the “Mid-Market” category.[70][71]
