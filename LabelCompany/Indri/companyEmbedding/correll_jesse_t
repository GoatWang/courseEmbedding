This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

However, the most important tools in the kitchen are the cookware and bakeware that chefs and cooks use to create their culinary masterpieces. Look to Walmart for the right pieces in your home kitchen so that you can make an array of complete meals, late-night snacks and delicious baked goods for your family and friends, all at Every Day Low Prices. Cookware More than any other non-utensil you use in the kitchen, nothing gets more use than your pots and pans. Although there are sets that contain 8, 10, 12 or more pieces (including lids), there are usually two or three go-to pieces that you use for nearly every meal. These include a small or medium pot, large saut  pan or skillet and a Dutch oven. With just those three pieces, you can cook nearly everything you might consider preparing in the kitchen. If you have room, additional pieces of cookware make for nice additions, which is why the sets of cookware that you can buy make so much sense. If you have the room, a good set of cookware should contain two different-sized saucepans (with lids), two or three different-sized skillets, a deep saucier pan for deep frying and a Dutch oven or stock pot. Lids for these pans may be interchangeable as many of them are the same diameter as each other. The material that makes up the cookware is just as important as how many pieces you have.  Stainless steel is very versatile and reliable as it can take high heat, easily going from the stove to the oven, and cleans up somewhat easily, although it requires cooking with some form of fat, such as oil or butter, to prevent food from sticking. Nonstick pans are ideal for those who are concerned about cleanup, but some of these pans are not suitable for oven use, and you must only use wooden or silicone utensils with them to prevent damaging the nonstick coating. Tri-ply pans that have a copper core encased between two layers of stainless steel, known as clad, are ideal cookware as these heat food more evenly. Other options available include aluminum, ceramic, copper and hard-anodized. Other cookware items you may want to have on hand include cast-iron pans or carbon steel pans. These pans, after being seasoned, have a natural nonstick ability to them. Additional items to consider include:  Grill pan   ideal for those who cook meats like steak indoors and want to have grill marks on their food Double boiler   makes it possible to create delicate sauces like Hollandaise sauce or temper items like chocolate without burning them Large stock pot   makes it easy to boil long pasta or seafood like whole lobster Wok   useful for cooking over flame at high temperatures, such as when stir-frying vegetables and meat Pressure cooker   makes large cuts of meat in a shorter time as it uses steam and cooks under pressure, resulting in tender foods Roasting pan   ideal for use in the oven to make large roast or fowl like a turkey Bakeware Although they are often used for baking breads and sweets, bakeware items are used quite often for general cooking purposes as well. One of the most important items to have are sheet pans. Sheet pans are great for making baked goods like cookies, but they also work well when roasting vegetables and broiling cuts of meat. They're also very handy when you need to hold food items in a warm oven while you finish the rest of the meal. Working hand in hand with sheet pans are silicone mats, which provide nonstick ability to pans that would have to be heavily oiled otherwise. Cookie sheets are like sheet pans except that have no raised edges, allowing bakers to remove baked items more easily. There are many pans that can be part of the home bakeware arsenal. These include cake pans, which can be round, square or rectangular; springform pans, which are ideal for delicate baked goods like cheesecake; pie pans; loaf pans (for making bread or meat dishes like meatloaf); and a tube or Bundt pan. Many of these pans are metal, but there are also glass and silicone pans that serve the same purposes. Casserole dishes, especially one that is 13 inches by 9 inches, are ideal for making many things in the oven, such as casseroles, cakes and macaroni and cheese. Other bakeware items to consider, depending on what you like to make at home, include:  Pizza stone and pizza pans   for making homemade pizza Souffl  dishes and ramekins   for making egg-based dishes and custards Tart pan   for making pastries and quiches Muffin pans   for cupcakes and muffinsShow moreElectrode, Comp-167313239, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
