Gold Reserve Inc. Updates Shareholders On ICSID Award






Business Wire




Nov 6, 2014 3:48 PM EST













 


















































  The Company may seek recognition and enforcement of the Award in other jurisdictions as well.   Activities at ICSID  As is permitted by Article 56 of the arbitration rules of ICSID's Additional Facility, both parties have filed requests for the arbitral tribunal to correct what each party has identified as "clerical, arithmetical or similar errors" in the Award. Article 56 of ICSID Additional Facility arbitration rules does not permit reconsideration by the tribunal of any aspect of its award and does not permit correction to an error of judgment. Rather, it permits the tribunal to correct inadvertent arithmetic or typographical errors. While the Company has identified what it considers to be an inadvertent arithmetic error that warrants an increase in the Award, Venezuela has identified what it contends are significant inadvertent arithmetic errors that it argues supports a reduction of the Award. The arbitral tribunal will consider the parties' requests and advise whether it concludes that any correction is warranted. The tribunal has requested the parties to simultaneously submit a reply to the other party's request for corrections of the Award by November 13, 2014.  The Company remains firmly committed to the enforcement and collection of the Award including accrued interest in full and will vigorously pursue all available remedies accordingly. The Award accrues interest at the rate of Libor plus 2% per annum during the pendency of the proceedings described above.  Information regarding the Company can be found in its regulatory filings and by going to the following websites: www.goldreserveinc.com, www.sec.gov and www.sedar.com.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This release contains "forward-looking statements" or "forward-looking information" as such terms are defined under applicable U.S. and Canadian securities laws (collectively referred to herein as "forward-looking statements") with respect to the ICSID Award related to the expropriation of the Company's Brisas Project by the Venezuela government. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management at this time, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies such as, among other things, the Company's ability to collect such Award.  We caution that such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other risks that may cause the actual outcomes, financial results, performance, or achievements of Gold Reserve to be materially different from our estimated outcomes, future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the timing of and amount of collection of the Award, if at all.  This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of Gold Reserve's forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Gold Reserve or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this notice. Gold Reserve disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements or the foregoing list of assumptions or factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, subject to its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. or Canadian securities laws.  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

SPOKANE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gold Reserve Inc. (TSX.V: GRZ) (OTC: GDRZF) (“Gold Reserve” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide an update on the activities in Venezuela on the Brisas Cristinas Project which is owned 55% by Venezuela and 45% by a subsidiary of Gold Reserve (through their mixed company Empresa Mixta Ecosocialista Siembra Minera, S.A. (“Siembra Minera S.A.”).
Gold Reserve and Venezuela have initiated activities to update the Feasibility Study and the Environmental Impact Statement previously prepared to include the expanded project with updated capital and operating costs. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) is also being prepared to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standards and is expected to be completed in a few months. In addition, Siembra Minera S.A. is in the process of obtaining the permits required to commence an early works program and a small miner program along with a fast track saprolite production plan ahead of the larger project. Contractors will be mobilizing to the site shortly to support these activities and begin early works. To support these activities Siembra Minera S.A. is pursuing various financing alternatives.
In addition, the Company is providing an update to the previously announced third amendment of the Settlement Agreement with Venezuela (the “Settlement Agreement”). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Venezuela has agreed to pay Gold Reserve a total of approximately US $1,037 million, comprised of approximately US $797 million to satisfy the arbitral ICSID Award granted in favor of the Company and US $240 million for the Company’s technical mining data related to the Brisas property.
Gold Reserve has received an initial installment of US $40 million under the Settlement Agreement and is scheduled to receive 20 monthly payments of US $29.5 million and three monthly payments of US $40.8 million on or before the 10th day of each month starting on July 10, 2017, totalling approximately US $712 million. The final payment of US $285 million is scheduled to be paid on or before June 10, 2019. In addition, Venezuela will place Venezuelan financial instruments with a face value of US $350 million in trust as collateral for the future payments.
Gold Reserve will refrain from enforcing the Award as long as Venezuela is current in its obligations to the Company. In addition, Venezuela has agreed to permanently withdraw all legal proceedings seeking annulment.
