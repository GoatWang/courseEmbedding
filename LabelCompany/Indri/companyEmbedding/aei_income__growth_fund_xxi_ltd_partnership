Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Growth & Income Fund among 
1222,
1222,
1081
and 
798
Large Blend
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be.

State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement
  .



Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Information is calculated by Morningstar.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.

The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017









The Fund
The Fund invests in common stocks, income instruments, preferred stocks and hybrid securities around the globe that the portfolio managers believe may provide attractive levels of income. For its investments in common stocks, the managers may also seek t o invest in securities they believe have the potential to grow income and/or provide capital appreciation over time.



The Approach
Fund managers employ a bottom-up, research driven process to identify what they believe are attractive global securities up and down the capital structure. Management endeavors to invest in income producing instruments, coupled with investments in common  stocks that may have the potential for growth of income and capital appreciation over time. Overall asset allocation decisions are made collectively by the portfolio managers.



The Features
The global, multi-asset class approach may provide diversification benefits as management seeks to uncover opportunities across an array of income producing securities and common stock. A flexible mandate with broad discretion (within the specified inves tment ranges) to allocate across investment instruments may help navigate the challenges that face traditional sources of income.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Changes in the dividend policies of companies could make it difficult to provide a predictable level of income. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volati lity than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Dividend capture strategies may result in higher portfolio turnover, increased trading costs and potential for capital loss or gains.  When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose m oney investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Changes in the dividend policies of companies could make it difficult to provide a predictable level of income. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volati lity than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Dividend capture strategies may result in higher portfolio turnover, increased trading costs and potential for capital loss or gains.  When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose m oney investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



1. MSCI World Index is an unmanaged index of equity securities in the developed markets. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not pos sible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.

4. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 2/28/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
8. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
9. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	JUNE 30, 2016


	(unaudited)






	(1)

	  The condensed statements included herein have been prepared by the registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these condensed statements consist only of normal recurring adjustments.  Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the registrant believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in the registrant's latest annual report on Form 10‑K.





	(2)  Organization –





	AEI Income & Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership ("Partnership") was formed to acquire and lease commercial properties to operating tenants.  The Partnership's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. ("AFM"), the Managing General Partner.  Robert P. Johnson, the President and sole director of AFM, serves as the Individual General Partner.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson is the majority shareholder.  AEI Fund Management, Inc. ("AEI"), an affiliate of AFM, performs the administrative and operating functions for the Partnership.





	The terms of the Partnership offering called for a subscription price of $1,000 per Limited Partnership Unit, payable on acceptance of the offer.  The Partnership commenced operations on April 14, 1995 when minimum subscriptions of 1,500 Limited Partnership Units ($1,500,000) were accepted.  On January 31, 1997, the offering terminated when the maximum subscription limit of 24,000 Limited Partnership Units was reached.  Under the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Limited Partners and General Partners contributed funds of $24,000,000 and $1,000, respectively.





	During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which the General Partners determine to distribute will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners; provided, however, that such distributions to the General Partners will be subordinated to the Limited Partners first receiving an annual, noncumulative distribution of Net Cash Flow equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution, as defined, and, provided further, that in no event will the General Partners receive less than 1% of such Net Cash Flow per annum.  Distributions to Limited Partners will be made pro rata by Units.

	AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND XXI LIMITED PARTNERSHIP


	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Continued)





	(2)  Organization – (Continued)





	Any Net Proceeds of Sale, as defined, from the sale or financing of properties which the General Partners determine to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves, be paid in the following manner: (i) first, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners until the Limited Partners receive an amount equal to: (a) their Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed from Net Cash Flow;  (ii) any remaining balance will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Distributions to the Limited Partners will be made pro rata by Units.





	For tax purposes, profits from operations, other than profits attributable to the sale, exchange, financing, refinancing or other disposition of property, will be allocated first in the same ratio in which, and to the extent, Net Cash Flow is distributed to the Partners for such year.  Any additional profits will be allocated in the same ratio as the last dollar of Net Cash Flow is distributed.  Net losses from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.





	For tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing, or other disposition of property will be allocated in accordance with the Partnership Agreement as follows: (i) first, to those partners with deficit balances in their capital accounts in an amount equal to the sum of such deficit balances; (ii) second, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners until the aggregate balance in the Limited Partners' capital accounts equals the sum of the Limited Partners' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus an amount equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously allocated; (iii) third, the balance of any remaining gain will then be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Losses will be allocated 98% to the Limited Partners and 2% to the General Partners.





	The General Partners are not required to currently fund a deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Partnership or withdrawal by a General Partner, the General Partners will contribute to the Partnership an amount equal to the lesser of the deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1% of total Limited Partners' and General Partners' capital contributions.





	In January 2014, the Managing General Partner mailed a Consent Statement (Proxy) seeking the consent of the Limited Partners to continue the Partnership for an additional 60 months or to initiate the final disposition, liquidation and distribution of all of the Partnership's properties and assets.  On February 14, 2014, the proposal to continue the Partnership was approved with a majority of Units voted in favor of the continuation proposal.  As a result, the Managing General Partner will continue the operations of the Partnership for an additional 60 months at which time it will again ask the Limited Partners to vote on the same two proposals.

The Partnership incurred $56,733 of acquisition expenses related to the purchase that were expensed.  The property is leased to Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 10 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $122,169.





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the value of in-place lease intangibles amortized to expense was $33,592 and $24,010 and the increase to rental income for below-market leases was $8,199 and $5,496, respectively.  For lease intangibles not held for sale as of June 30, 2016, the weighted average remaining life is 120 months for in-place lease intangibles and 89 months for below-market leases.  The estimated amortization expense is $76,764 and the estimated increase to rental income is $19,100 for each of the next five succeeding years.





	(4)  Payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc. –





	AEI Fund Management, Inc. performs the administrative and operating functions for the Partnership.  The payable to AEI Fund Management represents the balance due for those services.  This balance is non-interest bearing and unsecured and is to be paid in the normal course of business.





	(5)  Partners' Capital –





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership declared distributions of $525,356 and $552,316, respectively.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $520,103 and $546,793 and the General Partners received distributions of $5,253 and $5,523 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $26.04 and $25.71 per Limited Partnership Unit outstanding using 19,973 and 21,270 weighted average Units in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The distributions represented $10.52 and $10.60 per Unit of Net Income and $15.52 and $15.11 per Unit of contributed capital in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	As part of the distributions discussed above, the Partnership distributed net sale proceeds (from property sales completed in 2014) of $103,520 in 2015.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $102,485 and the General Partners received distributions of $1,035.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $4.81 per Unit.

The Partnership acquired these Units using net sale proceeds.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of $2,355 and $9,117 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	(6)  Fair Value Measurements –





	As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.









	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL


	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.





	This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters.  These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations, including the following:










	—


	Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate;










	—


	the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the Partners;










	—


	resolution by the General Partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted;










	—


	the success of the General Partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics;










	—


	the effect of tenant defaults; and










	—


	the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Partnership operate.










	Page 10 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	Application of Critical Accounting Policies





	The Partnership's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.  Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Partnership's assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  It is possible that the carrying amount of the Partnership's assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate.





	Management of the Partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing partner of the Partnership.





	Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties





	Upon acquisition of real properties, the Partnership records them in the financial statements at cost.  The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases.  The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property.  Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management's assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset.





	The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods.  The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities.  Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.  Below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.







	Page 11 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease.  Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease.  These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease.  These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.





	The determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables.  If management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.





	Carrying Value of Properties





	Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  The Partnership tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties the Partnership will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value.  For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value.  Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties.





	Allocation of Expenses





	AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs.  They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds they manage.  The Partnership reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement.

	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	Results of Operations





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized rental income of $642,701 and $589,796, respectively.  In 2016, rental income increased due to additional rent received from one property acquisition in 2016.  Based on the scheduled rent for the properties as of July 31, 2016, the Partnership expects to recognize rental income of approximately $1,306,000 in 2016.





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration expenses from affiliated parties of $86,357 and $113,480, respectively.  These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communication with the Limited Partners.  During the same periods, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of $32,184 and $27,818, respectively.  These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs.





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership incurred property acquisition expenses of $56,733 related to the purchase of the Dollar Tree store in Cincinnati, Ohio.





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized interest income of $1,812 and $5,794, respectively.





	Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations.  Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value.  However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions.





	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership's cash balances decreased $2,057,736 as a result of cash used to purchase property and distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Partnership's cash balances decreased $1,011,088 as a result of distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.







	Page 13 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $474,273 in 2015 to $515,898 in 2016 as a result of an increase in total rental and interest income in 2016, a decrease in Partnership administration and property management expenses in 2016, and net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses.  During 2016, cash from operations was reduced by $56,733 of acquisition expenses related to the purchase of real estate.  Pursuant to accounting guidance, these expenses were reflected as operating cash outflows.  However, pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, acquisition expenses were funded with proceeds from property sales.





	The major components of the Partnership's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership expended $1,809,915 to invest in real properties as the Partnership reinvested cash generated from property sales completed in 2014.





	On February 3, 2016, the Partnership purchased a Dollar Tree store in Cincinnati, Ohio for $1,809,915.  The property is leased to Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 10 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $122,169.





	The Partnership's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Partners and cash used to repurchase Units.  The Partnership declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter.  The Partnership attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter.  The Partnership may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations.





	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership declared distributions of $525,356 and $552,316, respectively, which were distributed 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $520,103 and $546,793 and the General Partners received distributions of $5,253 and $5,523 for the periods, respectively.





	As part of the distributions discussed above, the Partnership distributed net sale proceeds (from property sales completed in 2014) of $103,520 in 2015.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $102,485 and the General Partners received distributions of $1,035.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $4.81 per Unit.





	The Partnership may repurchase Units from Limited Partners who have tendered their Units to the Partnership.  Such Units may be acquired at a discount.  The Partnership will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 5% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Partnership.







	Page 14 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	On April 1, 2016, the Partnership repurchased a total of 264.01 Units for $233,076 from 12 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.  On April 1, 2015, the Partnership repurchased a total of 1,118.25 Units for $902,509 from 27 Limited Partners. The Partnership acquired these Units using net sale proceeds.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of $2,355 and $9,117 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Partnership obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

	ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.





	(a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

	(b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.





	During the most recent period covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS               
SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 

(Unaudited)               

(1)  The  condensed  statements included herein have been  prepared             
by  the Partnership, without audit, pursuant to the rules  and        
regulations  of  the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  and        
reflect   all  adjustments  which  are,  in  the  opinion   of        
management,  necessary to a fair statement of the  results  of        
operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent  with        
the  annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these        
condensed   statements  consist  only  of   normal   recurring        
adjustments.   Certain information, accounting  policies,  and        
footnote    disclosures   normally   included   in   financial        
statements  prepared  in  accordance with  generally  accepted        
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted  pursuant        
to  such  rules  and  regulations,  although  the  Partnership        
believes  that  the  disclosures  are  adequate  to  make  the        
information  presented not misleading.  It is  suggested  that        
these  condensed financial statements be read  in  conjunction        
with  the  financial statements and the summary of significant        
accounting  policies  and  notes  thereto  included   in   the        
Partnership's latest annual report on Form 10-KSB.                    

(2)  Organization -                                                             

AEI   Income   &   Growth   Fund  XXI  Limited   Partnership          
(Partnership)  was  formed to acquire and  lease  commercial          
properties   to   operating  tenants.    The   Partnership's          
operations  are  managed by AEI Fund  Management  XXI,  Inc.          
(AFM), the Managing General Partner.  Robert P. Johnson, the          
President and sole director of AFM, serves as the Individual          
General  Partner.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary  of  AEI          
Capital  Corporation of which Mr. Johnson  is  the  majority          
shareholder.  AEI Fund Management, Inc. (AEI), an  affiliate          
of  AFM, performs the administrative and operating functions          
for the Partnership.                                                  

The   terms   of  the  Partnership  offering  call   for   a          
subscription  price of $1,000 per Limited Partnership  Unit,          
payable   on  acceptance  of  the  offer.   The  Partnership          
commenced   operations  on  April  14,  1995  when   minimum          
subscriptions    of   1,500   Limited   Partnership    Units          
($1,500,000)  were  accepted.   On  January  31,  1997,  the          
offering  terminated when the maximum subscription limit  of          
24,000  Limited  Partnership Units was reached.   Under  the          
terms  of  the  Limited Partnership Agreement,  the  Limited          
Partners   and   General  Partners  contributed   funds   of          
$24,000,000 and $1,000, respectively.                                 

During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which  the          
General Partners determine to distribute will be distributed          
90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners;          
provided,  however, that such distributions to  the  General          
Partners will be subordinated to the Limited Partners  first          
receiving an annual, noncumulative distribution of Net  Cash          
Flow equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution, as          
defined,  and, provided further, that in no event  will  the          
General Partners receive less than 1% of such Net Cash  Flow          
per  annum.  Distributions to Limited Partners will be  made          
pro rata by Units.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS               
(Continued)               

(2)  Organization - (Continued)                                                 

Any  Net  Proceeds  of Sale, as defined, from  the  sale  or          
financing of properties which the General Partners determine          
to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,          
be  paid  in  the following manner: (i) first,  99%  to  the          
Limited  Partners and 1% to the General Partners  until  the          
Limited  Partners  receive an amount  equal  to:  (a)  their          
Adjusted  Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount  equal  to          
10%  of  their  Adjusted  Capital  Contribution  per  annum,          
cumulative  but not compounded, to the extent not previously          
distributed from Net Cash Flow;  (ii) any remaining  balance          
will  be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10%  to          
the General Partners.  Distributions to the Limited Partners          
will be made pro rata by Units.                                       

For   tax  purposes,  profits  from operations,  other  than          
profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,          
refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be          
allocated  first  in the same ratio in  which,  and  to  the          
extent,  Net  Cash Flow is distributed to the  Partners  for          
such year.  Any additional profits will be allocated in  the          
same  ratio  as  the  last  dollar  of  Net  Cash  Flow   is          
distributed.   Net losses from operations will be  allocated          
99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.           

For  tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,          
or  other  disposition  of property  will  be  allocated  in          
accordance  with the Partnership Agreement as  follows:  (i)          
first,  to  those  partners with deficit balances  in  their          
capital  accounts  in an amount equal to  the  sum  of  such          
deficit  balances; (ii) second, 99% to the Limited  Partners          
and  1%  to the General Partners until the aggregate balance          
in  the Limited Partners' capital accounts equals the sum of          
the Limited Partners' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus an          
amount  equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions          
per  annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not          
previously  allocated;  (iii)  third,  the  balance  of  any          
remaining  gain  will then be allocated 90% to  the  Limited          
Partners  and 10% to the General Partners.  Losses  will  be          
allocated 98% to the Limited Partners and 2% to the  General          
Partners.                                                             

The  General Partners are not required to currently  fund  a          
deficit   capital   balance.   Upon   liquidation   of   the          
Partnership or withdrawal by a General Partner, the  General          
Partners will contribute to the Partnership an amount  equal          
to  the  lesser  of  the deficit balances in  their  capital          
accounts  or  1%  of  total Limited  Partners'  and  General          
Partners' capital contributions.

(3)  Investments in Real Estate -                                               

On  January 1, 2004, the Partnership owned 36.4787%  of  the          
Winn-Dixie store in Panama City, Florida.  During the  first          
quarter  of  2004,  the  Partnership sold  16.0762%  of  the          
property, in three separate transactions, to unrelated third          
parties.   The  Partnership received net  sale  proceeds  of          
$874,236,  which  resulted in a net gain of  $137,068.   The          
cost  and  related accumulated depreciation of the interests          
sold was $745,138 and $7,970, respectively.                           

In February 2005, Winn-Dixie Montgomery, Inc., the lessee of          
the Winn-Dixie store in Panama City, Florida, and its parent          
company,  Winn-Dixie, Inc., filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy          
reorganization.   Rents  are  current  and  the  Partnership          
expects to continue to receive all scheduled rents in future          
months  unless the Lease is rejected by Winn-Dixie.  If  the          
Lease  is  affirmed, Winn-Dixie must comply with  all  Lease          
terms.   If  the  Lease  is rejected,  Winn-Dixie  would  be          
required  to  return  possession  of  the  property  to  the          
Partnership  and  the Partnership would be  responsible  for          
real   estate   taxes  and  other  costs   associated   with          
maintaining the property.  The Partnership has evaluated the          
lease  and  property  value and decided  that  there  is  no          
impairment  loss at this time.  At September 30,  2005,  the          
book value of this property was $883,713.

Inc. under a Lease Agreement with a primary term of 20 years          
and  annual  rental  payments of  $153,228.   The  remaining

On  September  20,  2004, the Partnership  purchased  a  40%

in  the  property  was purchased by AEI Accredited  Investor

On  January  14,  2005,  the  Partnership  purchased  a  40%          
interest  in a Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan          
for $1,464,783.  The property is leased to Sterling Jewelers          
Inc.  under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary  term          
of  15  years  and annual rental payments of $102,520.   The

Income   &  Growth  Fund  25  LLC,  an  affiliate   of   the

On  March 18, 2005, the Partnership purchased a 20% interest

During  the  first  nine  months  of  2005  and  2004,   the          
Partnership  distributed $467,043 and $225,776 of  net  sale          
proceeds  to  the Limited and General Partners  as  part  of          
their quarterly distributions, which represented a return of          
capital  of  $20.26 and $9.76 per Limited Partnership  Unit,          
respectively.  The Partnership anticipates the remaining net          
sale  proceeds  will  either  be  reinvested  in  additional          
property or distributed to the Partners in the future.                

The financial results for these properties are reflected  as          
Discontinued   Operations  in  the  accompanying   financial

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

The Management's Discussion and Analysis contains various       
"forward  looking  statements"  within  the  meaning  of  federal               
securities  laws  which  represent management's  expectations  or               
beliefs  concerning future events, including statements regarding               
anticipated  application of cash, expected  returns  from  rental               
income,  growth  in revenue, taxation levels, the sufficiency  of               
cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other               
matters.  These, and other forward looking statements made by the               
Partnership,  must be evaluated in the context  of  a  number  of               
factors that may affect the Partnership's financial condition and               
results of operations, including the following:                                 

Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value                
of  the  properties the Partnership owns and  the  cash                 
from rental income such properties generate;                            

the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,                
deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the                 
affects of these consequences for the Partners;                         

resolution  by  the General Partners of  conflicts  with                
which they may be confronted;                                           

the   success  of  the  General  Partners  of   locating                
properties with favorable risk return characteristics;                  

the effect of tenant defaults; and                                      

the  condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of              
properties owned by the Partnership operate.                            

The Application of Critical Accounting Policies                                 

The preparation of the Partnership's financial statements       
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may               
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and               
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and               
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing               
basis,  including  those related to the carrying  value  of  real               
estate  and  the  allocation  by AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.  of               
expenses  to  the  Partnership as opposed  to  other  funds  they               
manage.                                                                         

The Partnership purchases properties and records them  in       
the  financial  statements  at the lower  of  cost  or  estimated               
realizable   value.   The  Partnership  initially   records   the               
properties  at cost (including capitalized acquisition expenses).               
The Partnership is required to periodically evaluate the carrying               
value  of properties to determine whether their realizable  value               
has  declined.   For  properties the Partnership  will  hold  and               
operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by               
comparing the property's probability-weighted cash flows  to  its               
current carrying value.  For properties held for sale, management               
determines  whether  impairment has  occurred  by  comparing  the               
property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its  current               
carrying  value.   If  the carrying value  is  greater  than  the               
realizable  value, an impairment loss is recorded to  reduce  the               
carrying value of the property to its realizable value.  A change               
in  these assumptions or analysis could cause material changes in               
the carrying value of the properties.                                           

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)                       

AEI Fund Management Inc. allocates expenses to each of the        
funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the number of  hours               
devoted  by  their employees to each fund's affairs.   They  also               
allocate  expenses at the end of each month that are not directly               
related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors               
in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds               
they  manage.  The Partnership reimburses these expenses  subject               
to detailed limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement.                 

Management   of  the  Partnership  has   discussed   the      
development  and selection of the above accounting estimates  and               
the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them               
with the managing partner of the Partnership.                                   

Results of Operations                                                           

For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the        
Partnership  recognized rental income from continuing  operations               
of $1,253,095 and $981,450, respectively.  In 2005, rental income               
increased  due  to  additional rent received from  four  property               
acquisitions  in  2004  and  2005  and  rent  increases  on   two               
properties.                                                                     

For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the        
Partnership  incurred  Partnership administration  expenses  from               
affiliated parties of $189,640 and $162,083, respectively.  These               
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the               
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting               
requirements and correspondence to the Limited Partners.   During               
the   same   periods,   the  Partnership   incurred   Partnership               
administration  and property management expenses  from  unrelated               
parties  of  $32,394 and $27,110, respectively.   These  expenses               
represent  direct payments to third parties for legal and  filing               
fees,  direct  administrative costs, outside audit costs,  taxes,               
insurance and other property costs.                                             

For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the        
Partnership  recognized interest income of $33,652  and  $36,011,               
respectively.                                                                   

For  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2004,  the       
Partnership   recognized  gain  on  sale  of  real  estate   from               
continuing operations of $137,068 from the sale of the Winn-Dixie               
store.   Since the Partnership retains an ownership  interest  in               
the  property,  the operating results and gain  on  sale  of  the               
property were not classified as discontinued operations.                        

On January 1, 2004, the Partnership owned 36.4787% of the       
Winn-Dixie  store  in  Panama City, Florida.   During  the  first               
quarter  of 2004, the Partnership sold 16.0762% of the  property,               
in  three separate transactions, to unrelated third parties.  The               
Partnership  received  net  sale  proceeds  of  $874,236,   which               
resulted  in  a  net  gain of $137,068.   The  cost  and  related               
accumulated  depreciation of the interests sold was $745,138  and               
$7,970, respectively.                                                           

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)                       

In February 2005, Winn-Dixie Montgomery, Inc., the lessee       
of  the  Winn-Dixie store in Panama City, Florida, and its parent               
company,  Winn-Dixie,  Inc.,  filed  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy               
reorganization.  Rents are current and the Partnership expects to               
continue  to receive all scheduled rents in future months  unless               
the  Lease  is rejected by Winn-Dixie.  If the Lease is affirmed,               
Winn-Dixie  must comply with all Lease terms.  If  the  Lease  is               
rejected,  Winn-Dixie would be required to return  possession  of               
the  property  to  the Partnership and the Partnership  would  be               
responsible for real estate taxes and other costs associated with               
maintaining  the  property.  The Partnership  has  evaluated  the               
lease  and property value and decided that there is no impairment               
loss at this time.  At September 30, 2005, the book value of this               
property was $883,713.                                                          

In  accordance  with  Statement of  Financial  Accounting       
Standards  No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal  of               
Long-Lived  Assets,  upon  complete disposal  of  a  property  or               
classification of a property as Real Estate Held  for  Sale,  the               
Partnership  includes  the operating  results  and  sale  of  the               
property   in   discontinued  operations.    In   addition,   the               
Partnership reclassifies the prior periods operating results  and               
any  partial  sales  of the property to discontinued  operations.               
For  the  nine  months ended September 30, 2004, the  Partnership               
recognized  income  from  discontinued  operations  of  $266,721,               
representing rental income less property management expenses  and               
depreciation of $138,085 and gain on disposal of real  estate  of               
$128,636.                                                                       

On  January 13, 2004, the Partnership sold its  remaining       
3.7372%  interest in the Garden Ridge retail store in  Pineville,               
North  Carolina  to  an unrelated third party.   The  Partnership               
received net sale proceeds of $392,836, which resulted in  a  net               
gain  of  $128,636.   At  December 31,  2003,  the  property  was               
classified  as  Real Estate Held for Sale with a  book  value  of               
$264,200.                                                                       

In June 2004, the Partnership entered into an agreement to        
sell the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Farmington, New Mexico  to               
an  unrelated third party.  On October 6, 2004, the  sale  closed               
with  the  Partnership receiving net sale proceeds of $2,893,779,               
which  resulted in a net gain of $786,594.  At the time of  sale,               
the  cost and related accumulated depreciation was $2,183,344 and               
$76,159, respectively.                                                          

In  2004, the Partnership realized significant gains from       
the  sale  of property.  While the real estate market is expected               
to  remain  attractive for sellers of property, there can  be  no               
assurance the Partnership will be able to achieve a similar level               
of   sales  activity  or  sales  profitability  in  2005  due  to               
unforeseen  changes in the real estate market.   In addition,  it               
is likely the Partnership will curtail its selling activity as it               
is  becoming more difficult to find attractive property in  which               
to reinvest the proceeds from property sales.                                   

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)                       

Inflation  has  had  a  minimal  effect  on  income  from       
operations.   Leases  may contain rent increases,  based  on  the               
increase  in  the  Consumer Price Index over a specified  period,               
which  will result in an increase in rental income over the  term               
of  the  leases.   In addition, leases may contain  rent  clauses               
which  entitle  the  Partnership to receive  additional  rent  in               
future  years  if gross receipts for the property exceed  certain               
specified  amounts.  Increases in sales volumes of  the  tenants,               
due to inflation and real sales growth, may result in an increase               
in rental income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may               
cause the real estate to appreciate in value.  However, inflation               
and  changing prices may have an adverse impact on the  operating               
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their               
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow               
available for distributions.                                                    

Liquidity and Capital Resources                                                 

During  the  nine months ended September  30,  2005,  the       
Partnership's cash balances decreased $4,050,451 as a  result  of               
cash  used  to purchase property and distributions  paid  to  the               
Partners  in  excess of cash generated from operating activities.               
During   the   nine  months  ended  September   30,   2004,   the               
Partnership's cash balances decreased $3,482,289 as a  result  of               
cash  used  to purchase property and distributions  paid  to  the               
Partners  in  excess of cash generated from operating activities,               
which  were partially offset by cash generated from the  sale  of               
property.                                                                       

Net  cash provided by operating activities increased from       
$862,143 in 2004 to $1,130,169 in 2005 as a result of an increase               
in  total  rental  and  interest income in 2005  and  net  timing               
differences  in the collection of payments from the  lessees  and               
the  payment  of  expenses, which were  partially  offset  by  an               
increase  in  Partnership administration and property  management               
expenses in 2005.                                                               

The  major components of the Partnership's cash flow from       
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds               
from  the  sale  of  real estate.  During the nine  months  ended               
September 30, 2004, the Partnership generated cash flow from  the               
sale  of real estate of $1,267,072.  During the nine months ended               
September  30, 2005 and 2004, the Partnership expended $3,347,879               
and  $3,839,008,  respectively,  to  invest  in  real  properties               
(inclusive of acquisition expenses) as the Partnership reinvested               
cash generated from property sales.                                             

On  February  9,  2004, the Partnership purchased  a  50%       
interest  in  a  Jared  Jewelry store in  Hanover,  Maryland  for               
$1,989,135.   The  property is leased to Sterling  Jewelers  Inc.               
under  a  Lease  Agreement with a primary term of  20  years  and               
annual  rental payments of $153,228.  The remaining  interest  in

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)                       

On  January  14,  2005, the Partnership purchased  a  40%       
interest  in a Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan  for               
$1,464,783.   The  property is leased to Sterling  Jewelers  Inc.               
under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 15 years               
and  annual rental payments of $102,520.  The remaining  interest               
in the property was purchased by AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC,               
an affiliate of the Partnership.                                                

On  March  18,  2005,  the Partnership  purchased  a  20%       
interest  in a CarMax auto superstore in Lithia Springs,  Georgia               
for   $1,883,096.   The  property  is  leased  to   CarMax   Auto               
Superstores,  Inc.  under  a  Lease Agreement  with  a  remaining               
primary  term  of  13.4  years  and  annual  rental  payments  of               
$136,080.  The remaining interests in the property were purchased               
by  AEI Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC, AEI Income & Growth Fund  25               
LLC   and   AEI   Private  Net  Lease  Millennium  Fund   Limited               
Partnership, affiliates of the Partnership.                                     

The  Partnership's primary use of cash flow,  other  than       
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption               
payments  to  Partners.   The Partnership  declares  its  regular               
quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter  and  pays               
the  distribution in the first ten days after  the  end  of  each               
quarter.    The  Partnership  attempts  to  maintain   a   stable               
distribution  rate from quarter to quarter.  Redemption  payments               
are  paid  to  redeeming Partners in the fourth quarter  of  each               
year.                                                                           

For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the        
Partnership  declared distributions of $1,530,303 and $1,227,278,               
respectively, which were distributed 99% to the Limited  Partners               
and  1%  to the General Partners.  The Limited Partners  received               
distributions  of  $1,515,000  and  $1,215,006  and  the  General               
Partners  received distributions of $15,303 and $12,272  for  the               
periods,   respectively.   In  September  2005,  the  Partnership               
declared a special distribution of $303,030 of net sale proceeds,               
which  resulted  in higher distributions during  the  first  nine               
months  of 2005, when compared to the first nine months of  2004.               
In December 2004, the Partnership declared a special distribution               
of  $606,061  of net sale proceeds, which resulted  in  a  higher               
distribution payable at December 31, 2004.                                      

During  the  first  nine months of  2005  and  2004,  the       
Partnership  distributed  $467,043  and  $225,776  of  net   sale               
proceeds  to  the Limited and General Partners as part  of  their               
quarterly distributions, which represented a return of capital of               
$20.26 and $9.76 per Limited Partnership Unit, respectively.  The               
Partnership  anticipates the remaining  net  sale  proceeds  will               
either be reinvested in additional property or distributed to the               
Partners in the future.                                                         

The  Partnership may acquire Units from Limited  Partners       
who have tendered their Units to the Partnership.  Such Units may               
be acquired at a discount.  The Partnership will not be obligated               
to purchase in any year any number of Units that, when aggregated               
with  all  other transfers of Units that have occurred since  the               
beginning   of  the  same  calendar  year  (excluding   Permitted               
Transfers as defined in the Partnership Agreement), would  exceed               
5%  of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such               
year.  In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase               
Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner,               
such  purchase  would  impair the capital  or  operation  of  the               
Partnership.                                                                    

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)                       

On October 1, 2005, four Limited Partners redeemed a total        
of  17  Partnership  Units  for $9,222  in  accordance  with  the               
Partnership Agreement.  On October 1, 2004, five Limited Partners               
redeemed  a  total of 88.04 Partnership Units for  $53,859.   The               
Partnership  acquired  these  Units  using  Net  Cash  Flow  from               
operations.   In  prior  years, a total of  49  Limited  Partners               
redeemed   1,092.51   Partnership  Units   for   $885,943.    The               
redemptions  increase the remaining Limited  Partners'  ownership               
interest  in  the  Partnership.  As a result of these  redemption               
payments  and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the  General               
Partners received distributions of $93 and $544 in 2005 and 2004,               
respectively.                                                                   

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together        
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to               
fund   continuing   distributions  and  meet  other   Partnership               
obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.                           

ITEM 3. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures              

Under  the  supervision  and with  the  participation  of       
management, including its President and Chief Financial  Officer,               
the  Managing  General Partner of the Partnership  evaluated  the               
effectiveness  of  the  design and operation  of  its  disclosure               
controls  and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-14(c) under  the               
Exchange  Act).   Based upon that evaluation, the  President  and               
Chief Financial Officer of the Managing General Partner concluded               
that,  as  of  the end of the period covered by this report,  the               
disclosure  controls  and  procedures  of  the  Partnership   are               
adequately  designed to ensure that information  required  to  be               
disclosed  by  us  in  the reports we file or  submit  under  the               
Exchange  Act  is recorded, processed, summarized  and  reported,               
within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms.                

(b)  Changes in internal controls                                 

There   were   no  significant  changes  made   in   the      
Partnership's  internal controls during the  most  recent  period               
covered  by  this  report that have materially affected,  or  are               
reasonably   likely  to  materially  affect,  the   Partnership's               
internal control over financial reporting.                                      

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION               

ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There are no material pending legal proceedings to  which       
the Partnership is a party or of which the Partnership's property               
is subject.                                                                     

ITEM  2.UNREGISTERED  SALES  OF  EQUITY  SECURITIES  AND  USE  OF               
PROCEEDS 

(a)  During  the  period  covered  by  this  report,  the       
Partnership  did  not  sell any equity securities  that  are  not               
registered under the Securities Act of 1933.                                    

(b) Not applicable.                                               

(c) Pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Partnership Agreement,       
each  Limited  Partner  has the right to  present  Units  to  the               
Partnership  for  purchase by submitting notice to  the  Managing               
General  Partner  during September of each  year.   The  purchase               
price  of  the  Units  is  based on a formula  specified  in  the               
Partnership  Agreement.  Units tendered to  the  Partnership  are               
redeemed  on  October 1st of each year subject to  the  following               
limitations.  The Partnership will not be obligated  to  purchase               
in  any  year any number of Units that, when aggregated with  all               
other  transfers of Units that have occurred since the  beginning               
of  the  same  calendar  year (excluding Permitted  Transfers  as               
defined  in the Partnership Agreement), would exceed  5%  of  the               
total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year.   In               
no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if,               
in  the  sole  discretion of the Managing General  Partner,  such               
purchase   would   impair  the  capital  or  operation   of   the               
Partnership.   During  the period covered  by  this  report,  the               
Partnership did not purchase any Units.

	(unaudited)






	(1)

	  The condensed statements included herein have been prepared by the registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these condensed statements consist only of normal recurring adjustments.  Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the registrant believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in the registrant's latest annual report on Form 10‑K.





	(2)  Organization –





	AEI Income & Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership ("Partnership") was formed to acquire and lease commercial properties to operating tenants.  The Partnership's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. ("AFM"), the Managing General Partner.  Robert P. Johnson, the President and sole director of AFM, serves as the Individual General Partner.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson is the majority shareholder.  AEI Fund Management, Inc. ("AEI"), an affiliate of AFM, performs the administrative and operating functions for the Partnership.





	The terms of the Partnership offering called for a subscription price of $1,000 per Limited Partnership Unit, payable on acceptance of the offer.  The Partnership commenced operations on April 14, 1995 when minimum subscriptions of 1,500 Limited Partnership Units ($1,500,000) were accepted.  On January 31, 1997, the offering terminated when the maximum subscription limit of 24,000 Limited Partnership Units was reached.  Under the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Limited Partners and General Partners contributed funds of $24,000,000 and $1,000, respectively.





	During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which the General Partners determine to distribute will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners; provided, however, that such distributions to the General Partners will be subordinated to the Limited Partners first receiving an annual, noncumulative distribution of Net Cash Flow equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution, as defined, and, provided further, that in no event will the General Partners receive less than 1% of such Net Cash Flow per annum.  Distributions to Limited Partners will be made pro rata by Units.

	(2)  Organization – (Continued)





	Any Net Proceeds of Sale, as defined, from the sale or financing of properties which the General Partners determine to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves, be paid in the following manner: (i) first, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners until the Limited Partners receive an amount equal to: (a) their Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed from Net Cash Flow;  (ii) any remaining balance will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Distributions to the Limited Partners will be made pro rata by Units.





	For tax purposes, profits from operations, other than profits attributable to the sale, exchange, financing, refinancing or other disposition of property, will be allocated first in the same ratio in which, and to the extent, Net Cash Flow is distributed to the Partners for such year.  Any additional profits will be allocated in the same ratio as the last dollar of Net Cash Flow is distributed.  Net losses from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.





	For tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing, or other disposition of property will be allocated in accordance with the Partnership Agreement as follows: (i) first, to those partners with deficit balances in their capital accounts in an amount equal to the sum of such deficit balances; (ii) second, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners until the aggregate balance in the Limited Partners' capital accounts equals the sum of the Limited Partners' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus an amount equal to 10% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously allocated; (iii) third, the balance of any remaining gain will then be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.  Losses will be allocated 98% to the Limited Partners and 2% to the General Partners.





	The General Partners are not required to currently fund a deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Partnership or withdrawal by a General Partner, the General Partners will contribute to the Partnership an amount equal to the lesser of the deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1% of total Limited Partners' and General Partners' capital contributions.





	In January 2014, the Managing General Partner mailed a Consent Statement (Proxy) seeking the consent of the Limited Partners to continue the Partnership for an additional 60 months or to initiate the final disposition, liquidation and distribution of all of the Partnership's properties and assets.  On February 14, 2014, the proposal to continue the Partnership was approved with a majority of Units voted in favor of the continuation proposal.  As a result, the Managing General Partner will continue the operations of the Partnership for an additional 60 months at which time it will again ask the Limited Partners to vote on the same two proposals.

	(3)  Real Estate Investments –





	On February 3, 2016, the Partnership purchased a Dollar Tree store in Cincinnati, Ohio for $1,809,915.  The Partnership allocated $285,049 of the purchase price to Acquired Intangible Lease Assets, representing in-place lease intangibles, and allocated $80,404 to Acquired Below-Market Lease Intangibles. The Partnership incurred $56,760 of acquisition expenses related to the purchase that were expensed.  The property is leased to Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 10 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $122,169.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the value of in-place lease intangibles amortized to expense was $52,783 and $36,015 and the increase to rental income for below-market leases was $12,974 and $8,244, respectively.  For lease intangibles not held for sale as of September 30, 2016, the weighted average remaining life is 117 months for in-place lease intangibles and 86 months for below-market leases.  The estimated amortization expense is $76,764 and the estimated increase to rental income is $19,100 for each of the next five succeeding years.





	(4)  Payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc. –





	AEI Fund Management, Inc. performs the administrative and operating functions for the Partnership.  The payable to AEI Fund Management represents the balance due for those services.  This balance is non-interest bearing and unsecured and is to be paid in the normal course of business.





	(5)  Partners' Capital –





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership declared distributions of $786,569 and $822,818, respectively.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $778,703 and $814,590 and the General Partners received distributions of $7,866 and $8,228 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $39.07 and $38.64 per Limited Partnership Unit outstanding using 19,929 and 21,083 weighted average Units in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The distributions represented $17.87 and $16.54 per Unit of Net Income and $21.20 and $22.10 per Unit of contributed capital in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	As part of the distributions discussed above, the Partnership distributed net sale proceeds (from property sales completed in 2014) of $139,022 in 2015.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $137,632 and the General Partners received distributions of $1,390.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $6.51 per Unit.

	(5)  Partners' Capital – (Continued)





	On April 1, 2016, the Partnership repurchased a total of 264.01 Units for $233,076 from 12 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.  On April 1, 2015, the Partnership repurchased a total of 1,118.25 Units for $902,509 from 27 Limited Partners. The Partnership acquired these Units using net sale proceeds.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of $2,355 and $9,117 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	(6)  Fair Value Measurements –





	As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.









	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL


	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.





	This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters.  These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations, including the following:










	—


	Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate;










	—


	the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the Partners;










	—


	resolution by the General Partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted;










	—


	the success of the General Partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics;










	—


	the effect of tenant defaults; and










	—


	the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Partnership operate.










	Page 10 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	Application of Critical Accounting Policies





	The Partnership's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.  Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Partnership's assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  It is possible that the carrying amount of the Partnership's assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate.





	Management of the Partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing partner of the Partnership.





	Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties





	Upon acquisition of real properties, the Partnership records them in the financial statements at cost.  The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases.  The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property.  Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management's assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset.





	The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods.  The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities.  Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.  Below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.







	Page 11 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease.  Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease.  These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease.  These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.





	The determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables.  If management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.





	Carrying Value of Properties





	Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  The Partnership tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties the Partnership will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value.  For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value.  Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties.





	Allocation of Expenses





	AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs.  They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds they manage.  The Partnership reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement.

	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	Results of Operations





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized rental income of $971,456 and $884,694, respectively.  In 2016, rental income increased due to additional rent received from one property acquisition in 2016 and a rent increase on one property.  Based on the scheduled rent for the properties as of October 31, 2016, the Partnership expects to recognize rental income of approximately $1,306,000 and $1,264,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration expenses from affiliated parties of $127,367 and $165,505, respectively.  These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communication with the Limited Partners.  During the same periods, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of $40,075 and $35,486, respectively.  These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership incurred property acquisition expenses of $56,760 related to the purchase of the Dollar Tree store in Cincinnati, Ohio.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized interest income of $2,361 and $8,337, respectively.





	Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations.  Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value.  However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions.





	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership's cash balances decreased $2,068,977 as a result of cash used to purchase property and distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership's cash balances decreased $1,059,814 as a result of distributions paid to the Partners and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.







	Page 13 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $696,049 in 2015 to $765,870 in 2016 as a result of an increase in total rental and interest income in 2016, a decrease in Partnership administration and property management expenses in 2016, and net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses.  During 2016, cash from operations was reduced by $56,760 of acquisition expenses related to the purchase of real estate.  Pursuant to accounting guidance, these expenses were reflected as operating cash outflows.  However, pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, acquisition expenses were funded with proceeds from property sales.





	The major components of the Partnership's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership expended $1,809,915 to invest in real properties as the Partnership reinvested cash generated from property sales completed in 2014.





	On February 3, 2016, the Partnership purchased a Dollar Tree store in Cincinnati, Ohio for $1,809,915.  The property is leased to Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 10 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $122,169.





	The Partnership's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Partners and cash used to repurchase Units.  The Partnership declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter.  The Partnership attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter.  The Partnership may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership declared distributions of $786,569 and $822,818, respectively, which were distributed 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partners.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $778,703 and $814,590 and the General Partners received distributions of $7,866 and $8,228 for the periods, respectively.





	As part of the distributions discussed above, the Partnership distributed net sale proceeds (from property sales completed in 2014) of $139,022 in 2015.  The Limited Partners received distributions of $137,632 and the General Partners received distributions of $1,390.  The Limited Partners' distributions represented $6.51 per Unit.





	The Partnership may repurchase Units from Limited Partners who have tendered their Units to the Partnership.  Such Units may be acquired at a discount.  The Partnership will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 5% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Partnership.







	Page 14 of 17








	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)





	On April 1, 2016, the Partnership repurchased a total of 264.01 Units for $233,076 from 12 Limited Partners in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.  On April 1, 2015, the Partnership repurchased a total of 1,118.25 Units for $902,509 from 27 Limited Partners. The Partnership acquired these Units using net sale proceeds.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Partners' ownership interest in the Partnership.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partners received distributions of $2,355 and $9,117 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Partnership obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.








	ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE & QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.





	Not required for a smaller reporting company.








	ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.





	(a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Growth & Income Fund among 
1222,
1222,
1081
and 
798
Large Blend
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Many of our mutual funds earn Morningstar’s highest ratings
Morningstar 4- and 5-Star Rated Funds

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.

The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Dividends Taken in Cash
Dividend Reinvested














Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017









The Fund
The Fund invests in common stocks, income instruments, preferred stocks and hybrid securities around the globe that the portfolio managers believe may provide attractive levels of income. For its investments in common stocks, the managers may also seek t o invest in securities they believe have the potential to grow income and/or provide capital appreciation over time.



The Approach
Fund managers employ a bottom-up, research driven process to identify what they believe are attractive global securities up and down the capital structure. Management endeavors to invest in income producing instruments, coupled with investments in common  stocks that may have the potential for growth of income and capital appreciation over time. Overall asset allocation decisions are made collectively by the portfolio managers.



The Features
The global, multi-asset class approach may provide diversification benefits as management seeks to uncover opportunities across an array of income producing securities and common stock. A flexible mandate with broad discretion (within the specified inves tment ranges) to allocate across investment instruments may help navigate the challenges that face traditional sources of income.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Changes in the dividend policies of companies could make it difficult to provide a predictable level of income. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volati lity than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Dividend capture strategies may result in higher portfolio turnover, increased trading costs and potential for capital loss or gains.  When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose m oney investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Changes in the dividend policies of companies could make it difficult to provide a predictable level of income. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volati lity than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Dividend capture strategies may result in higher portfolio turnover, increased trading costs and potential for capital loss or gains.  When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose m oney investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



1. MSCI World Index is an unmanaged index of equity securities in the developed markets. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not pos sible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund. MSCI indexes are net of foreign withholding taxes. Source: MSCI. MSCI data may not be r eproduced or used for any other purpose. MSCI provides no warranties, has not prepared or approved this report, and has no liability hereunder.
3. Source: Fund prospectus.
4. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 2/28/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
8. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
9. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.
