The Intuitive Surgical product line is designed to provide surgeons with the capabilities of traditional open surgery while enabling them to operate through a few small incisions. 
The da Vinci® Surgical System features a 3D HD vision system for a clear and magnified view inside the patient's body. da Vinci's EndoWrist® instruments bend and rotate far greater than the human wrist. The surgeon controls the da Vinci System, which translates his or her hand movements into smaller, more precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient's body. da Vinci technology allows surgeons to perform complex and routine procedures through a few small openings, similar to traditional laparoscopy.

EndoWrist® Instruments

Intuitive Surgical's EndoWrist® Instruments are designed to provide surgeons with natural dexterity while operating through small incisions. Most EndoWrist instruments are modeled after the human wrist, offering a greater range of motion than the human hand.  

EndoWrist Instruments feature:

	* 7 degrees of freedom
	* 90 degrees of articulation
	* Intuitive motion and finger-tip  control
	* Motion scaling and tremor reduction


The EndoWrist Instruments are available in a wide selection of specialized tip. The following is a list of instrument categories for which  Intuitive offers specialized tip designs.
 


Advanced Energy Instruments










Energy instruments are used by the da Vinci surgeon to provide coagulation,  cutting and dissection of tissues.  These  include da Vinci monopolar and bipolar cautery instruments (electrical energy), the  da Vinci Harmonic™ ACE (mechanical energy), the  da Vinci PK™ Dissecting Forceps (advanced  bipolar), and laser.




Forceps










Grasping instruments are designed to grasp a wide range of tissues. There are instruments designed for fine, thin tissues, such as the peritoneum and instruments designed for dense, fibrous tissues, like the uterus. 




Needle drivers










Needle drivers provide the ability to suture with the finest of needles used in cardiovascular surgery as well as the thickest needles used in repair of uterine defects. SutureCut™ Needle Drivers include an integral cutting blade for efficient cutting of suture after knot tying and increased surgeon autonomy and efficiency.




Retractors










Retracting instruments allow the surgeon to dynamically provide exposure of the  surgical field. This minimizes dependency on the patient-side assistant,  providing the da Vinci surgeon with  full control of the operative field.




Other Specialized Instruments










Clip appliers, probe graspers, and cardiac stabilizers  are available to allow the da Vinci surgeon  to perform specialized procedures such as vessel clipping, cryoablation, and  beating-heart surgery.




5mm Instruments










A selection of 5mm Endowrist Instruments provides the surgeon with the ability to use smaller access ports.  Some surgeons prefer smaller access ports when performing pediatric, thoracic, bariatric, gynecologic, and general surgery.





Ease of Use
The EndoWrist Instruments are designed to be user-friendly in all aspects of surgery. After an instrument is mounted to the da Vinci System, the interface is designed to recognize the type and function of the instrument, and display the number of uses. With this unique interface, the da Vinci System detects when an instrument needs replacing.
The EndoWrist Instruments, designed exclusively for the da Vinci System, are available directly from Intuitive Surgical and its authorized distributors worldwide. For additional information, contact Intuitive Surgical Customer Service.



Cleaning & Sterilization
The Endowrist instruments are validated to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation Technical Information Report 12 standard (AAMI TIR 12 standard): Designing, testing and labeling reusable medical devices for reprocessing in health care facilities.


Single-Site™ Instrumentation
da Vinci® Single-Site® Instrumentation is designed for single-incision surgery, with curved cannulae and semi-rigid shafts.  These instruments enable surgeons to perform surgery through one incision through the umbilicus. Learn more.

The da Vinci Skills Simulator provides for comprehensive da Vinci Surgical System adoption. When the simulator is integrated with a da Vinci Xi, Si, or Si-e surgeon console, users can engage in the following:

Training

Surgeons and surgical teams can engage in training with system skills exercises and 3D videos to align training pathways to specific surgical specialties.


The Skills Simulator exercises range from basic to advanced and are designed to be relevant to surgeons from any specialty.
Each exercise covers at least one of the following skill categories:

	* EndoWrist® Manipulation - EndoWrist instruments are designed to provide surgeons with natural dexterity and a range of motion far greater than even the human hand. These exercises are designed to help users gain familiarity with the movement of these instruments. 
	* Camera and Clutching – The three-dimensional, enhanced high-definition vision of the da Vinci System offers a key clinical advantage in surgery, and these exercises help users improve camera control and learn to use the clutch effectively.

	* Fourth Arm Integration – For more advanced instrument control skills, some exercises include a fourth instrument arm that must be used. This is designed to promote instrument skill, and encourages users to think strategically about instrument placement during tasks. 
	* System Settings – The surgeon console features a comprehensive set of controls for user settings. Quiz exercises on the simulator focus on basic setting topics such as icons, ergonomics and instrument scaling. 
	* Needle Control and Driving – These scenarios are designed to help users develop skill when manipulating needles, including a focus on how to effectively hand off and position needles
    while practicing with a range of geometries. 
	* Energy and Dissection – The footswitch panel enables users to perform a range of tasks such as swapping between different types of energy instruments. These exercises allow users to gain familiarity with the footswitch panel by letting them practice applying monopolar and bipolar energy while working on dissection tasks.

Q.  Why is the company called Intuitive  Surgical?
A. The Company is called Intuitive Surgical because its technologies allow surgeons to operate intuitively with the same direct approach as open surgery, but through small incisions (laparoscopically). Unlike with traditional laparoscopy, when a da Vinci surgeon moves the hand controls at the surgeon console clockwise, the tiny wristed instruments inside the patient also move clockwise. With the da Vinci System, left means left and right means right, similar to the maneuvers of open surgery.
Q. What is minimally invasive surgery (MIS)?
A. Minimally invasive surgery, also called laparoscopy or laparoscopic surgery, is used on patients diagnosed with many different conditions. During minimally invasive surgery, surgeons operate through one or more small incisions, depending on the type of surgery. The da Vinci® Surgical System is a form of laparoscopic surgery that enables surgeons to operate using a 3D HD vision system and tiny instruments that bend and rotate far greater than the human hand. As a result of this technology, da Vinci enables surgeons to operate with enhanced vision, precision and control.
Q. Why is the product called the da Vinci®  Surgical System?
A. The da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to operate minimally invasively through a few small incisions or the belly button, similar to traditional laparoscopy. Using the da Vinci System, surgeons site at a nearby ergonomic console. da Vinci features a magnified 3D HD vision system and tiny wristed instruments that bend and rotate far greater than the human hand. As a result of this technology, da Vinci enables surgeons to operate with enhanced vision, precision and control. Learn more about da Vinci Surgery.
Q. Has the da Vinci Surgical  System been cleared by the FDA?
A. The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the da Vinci Surgical  System for use in a wide range of procedures. For additional information, please see Indications for Use. 
Q: What procedures have been performed using the da Vinci Surgical System? 
A. da Vinci surgical procedures are routinely performed in the specialties of: general, urologic, gynecologic, transoral, cardiac, thoracic, and pediatric surgery. da Vinci® Single-Site™ technology enables surgeons to remove the gallbladder and uterus through one small incision in the belly button. Over the last decade, the da Vinci System has brought minimally invasive surgery to over 2 million patients worldwide. 
Q. Are there studies showing that da Vinci Surgery is better than traditional open surgery?
A. Since 1998, more than 7,000 peer-reviewed publications have appeared in various clinical journals on da Vinci Surgery. The amount of clinical evidence on the da Vinci System is increasing at a rate of 100 publications per month. 
Q: Where is the da Vinci  Surgical System being used now? 
A: The  da Vinci Surgical System is used in major centers in the United States, France, Italy,  Germany and Spain, as well as in many other countries around the world. To  locate a hospital or surgeon, go to: http://www.davincisurgeonlocator.com/
Q. Will the da Vinci Surgical System make the surgeon unnecessary?
A. On the contrary, the da Vinci System is designed to enable surgeons to operate with enhanced vision, precision and control. The da Vinci System translates the surgeon's hand movements into smaller, precise movements of the miniaturized instruments inside the patient's body. The da Vinci System is 100% controlled by the surgeon and can never be programmed to make surgical maneuvers on its own.
Q. While using the da Vinci Surgical System, can the surgeon feel anything inside the patient's chest or abdomen?
A. Motors  on the system move the robotic arms and instruments in response to the  surgeon’s hand movements on the controls. As a result, the surgeon receives or  feels subtle physical “feedback” while holding the controls. This feedback  provides a substitute for the actual sense of touch and is augmented by the  enhanced vision provided by the high definition 3D view. While surgeons are not  able to touch or feel the anatomy as in open surgery, they indicate that the visualization, precision, dexterity and control that da Vinci offers them during surgery more  than compensates for the loss of touch. 
Q. Is a surgeon using theda Vinci  Surgical System operating in "virtual reality"?
A. No.  Although seated at a console a few feet from the patient, the surgeon views an  actual image inside the patient’s body while operating in real-time. At no time  does the surgeon see a virtual image, or program the system to perform any  independent maneuvers outside of the surgeon's direct, real-time control.
Q. Is this "robotic surgery"?
A. Robotic  surgical devices are designed to perform entirely independent movements after  being programmed by a surgeon. The da  Vinci Surgical System is a computer-enhanced system that introduces  a computer interface and 3DHD vision system between the surgeon's eyes, hands  and the tips of micro-instruments. The system mimics the surgeon's hand  movements in real time. It cannot be programmed, nor can it make decisions on  its own to move or perform any type of surgical maneuver. So, while the general  term "robotic surgery" is often used to refer to our technology, it  is not robotic surgery in the strictest sense of the term.
Q. Is this telesurgery? Can you operate over long distances?
A. Our robotic surgical platforms currently allow surgeons to perform complex procedures using a minimally invasive approach. 
In the interest of improving the surgeon training experience and expanding training programs, we are exploring telesurgery as a way to provide more convenient or expedient surgeon-to-surgeon proctoring and coaching. We see telesurgery as a means to allow surgeons to learn and optimize their robotic-assisted surgery skills under the guidance of leading specialists – with less disruption to clinical schedules due to travel — and therefore less impact on patients.
Q. Is Intuitive Surgical developing the da Vinci System for telesurgical applications? 
A. Intuitive  Surgical's  goal is to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to as many  patients as possible. Our strategy to achieve this includes the development of  products that allow doctors to rapidly expand their surgical techniques and  capabilities. Our robotic surgical platforms currently allow surgeons to  perform complex procedures using a minimally invasive approach.

Q. Is Intuitive's technology patented?
A. Intuitive has an extensive patent portfolio of internally developed technology, as well  as a variety of patents acquired or exclusively licensed from leaders in  surgical robotics.
Q: Why isn't Intuitive Surgical getting involved in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Defense Sciences project to develop robotic technology for use on the battlefield? 
A: The DARPA project was, in fact, the  project that inspired the creation of the first da Vinci System, and Intuitive  Surgical's da  Vinci Surgical System could theoretically be used to operate over  long distances. However, optimizing the da  Vinci System for remote or telesurgery applications is not the  primary focus of the company's product design and development efforts, and this  capability is not available with the current da  Vinci Surgical System. Intuitive  Surgical is optimizing its products for applications in minimally invasive  surgery today.
Q: Where is Intuitive headquartered?
A: Intuitive's  principal corporate offices are located in Sunnyvale, California, United  States, which is in Silicon Valley, near San Jose. 
Q: How are Intuitive's  products sold?
A: We currently market our system in the United States through a direct sales organization to hospitals. We have European operations headquartered in Aubonne, Switzerland and Asia-Pacific operations headquartered in Shanghai, China. We sell directly in some European countries and in Korea, and we use distributors and agents throughout the rest of the world. 
Q: What is the average cost of the da Vinci Surgical System? 
A: The average selling price of the da Vinci System varies according to  model, features, service contract, etc. Please see our investor presentation for more details.


Serious complications may occur in any surgery, including da Vinci® Surgery, up to and including death. Examples of serious or life-threatening complications, which may require prolonged and/or unexpected hospitalization and/or reoperation, include but are not limited to, one or more of the following: injury to tissues/organs, bleeding, infection and internal scarring that can cause long-lasting dysfunction/pain. Risks of surgery also include the potential for equipment failure and/or human error. Individual surgical results may vary.
Risks specific to minimally invasive surgery, including da Vinci Surgery, include but are not limited to, one or more of the following: temporary pain/nerve injury associated with positioning; temporary pain/discomfort from the use of air or gas in the procedure; a longer operation and time under anesthesia and conversion to another surgical technique. If your doctor needs to convert the surgery to another surgical technique, this could result in a longer operative time, additional time under anesthesia, additional or larger incisions and/or increased complications.
Patients who are not candidates for non-robotic minimally invasive surgery are also not candidates for da Vinci® Surgery. Patients should talk to their doctor to decide if da Vinci Surgery is right for them. Patients and doctors should review all available information on non-surgical and surgical options in order to make an informed decision.

The growth in our overall procedure volume in 2016 was driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.  Table of Contents  . . .

Will Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) Surprise in Q2 Earnings?


July 18, 2017, 09:51:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company's earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.63%. Also, the company delivered an average beat of 14.44% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for Intuitive Surgical prior to this announcement.  Factors at Play  We believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a key catalyst. Earlier, da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. For the second quarter, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down a bit outside the U.S. The company anticipates full-year 2017 procedure growth within 12% to 14%. Full-year 2017 gross profit margin is expected in the upper end of the range of 69% to 71% of net revenue. Moreover, rising procedural volumes outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, fortifies the company's market position. In fact, the integrated Table Motion product line has gained significant traction within a short span of time and is likely to boost the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, increased spending on product development and higher investments in expanding the company's footprint in international markets are prudent moves to drive long-term growth in our view. We note that Intuitive Surgical outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments  sub-industry in the last one year. While the stock has returned 41.11%, the sub-industry has gained only 10.08%.   Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS     Surprise        Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Quote   Earnings Whispers  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Intuitive Surgical is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.  Zacks ESP:  Intuitive Surgical's Earnings ESP is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $4.86. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .  Zacks Rank:  Intuitive Surgical has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Also, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to Consider  Here are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:      Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO  has an Earnings ESP of 0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .  Dextera Surgical Inc. DXTR  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and holds a Zacks Rank #2. Telefex Incorporated TFX  has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.  5 Trades Could Profit "Big-League" from Trump Policies    If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.    Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

Top Analyst Lifts Price Target for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) on Back of Strong 2Q Results
 
 Peter Murray, Editor-July 21, 2017, 10:11 AM EDT

SHARE ON:





 


 


Canaccord analyst Jason Mills is out today with a bullish research note on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), cheering the company’s strong second-quarter results. However, while Mills raised his price target for ISRG from $870 to $1,000, the analyst keeps his rating at Hold. (To watch Mills’ track record, click here)
Mills explained, “ISRG delivered another stellar quarter, with robust procedure volume growth once again on display (+16% in Q2). The business continues to fire on all cylinders, which has never been our issue with the company, as we think ISRG possesses strong underlying fundamentals and a robust product pipeline (e.g., Sp platform, catheter robotics, and advanced imaging technologies). At current valuations, however, and as we opined on in our recent downgrade note, we think you’re already paying for current fundamentals and contribution from this pipeline through at least 2018. Beyond that, competition from Medtronic seems likely to be part of the ISRG storyline.”
Out of the 12 analysts polled in the past 12 months, 7 are bullish on Intuitive Surgical shares, 4 are neutral, and only 1 is bearish. With a downside potential of 2%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $930.

History[edit]
The research that eventually led to the development of the da Vinci Surgical System was performed in the late 1980s at non-profit research institute SRI International.[5] In 1990, SRI received funding from the National Institutes of Health. SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield.
In 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it, to no avail. In 1995, Moll was introduced to John Freund, who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc. At that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital. Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]
The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as "Lenny" (after the young Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named "Leonardo", and another was "Mona". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States.[citation needed]
The company raised $46 million in an initial public offering in 2000. That same year, the FDA approved use of the da Vinci Surgical System for general laparoscopic surgery, which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease. In 2001, the FDA approved use of the system for prostate surgery. The FDA has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery, cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions, and gynecologic procedures.[6]
Shortly before going public, Intuitive Surgical was sued for patent infringement by Computer Motion, Inc, its chief rival. Computer Motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than Intuitive Surgical, with its own system, the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System. Although the ZEUS system was approved in Europe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the FDA first approved the da Vinci system. The uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each company's growth. In 2003, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion agreed to merge, thus ending the litigation between them.[7] The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system.
Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500),[8] primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014).

The da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system. The system is controlled by a surgeon from a console. It is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.[9][10]
Overview[edit]
The da Vinci System has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy, in which the surgeon operates while standing, using hand-held, long-shafted instruments, which have no wrists. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console. Three of the arms are for tools that hold objects, act as a scalpel, scissors, bovie, or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments. The fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console. The surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a 3-D image of the procedure, meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers. Right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize, coagulate, or cut the tissue. Left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away. The da Vinci System scales, filters and translates the surgeon's hand movements into more precise micro-movements of the instruments, which operate through small incisions in the body.
By providing surgeons with superior visualization, enhanced dexterity, greater precision and ergonomic comfort, the da Vinci Surgical System makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction. For the patient, a da Vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure, including less pain, less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions. Moreover, the da Vinci System can enable a shorter hospital stay, a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities.[11]
A da Vinci Surgical System costs approximately $1.5 million.[12] The new da Vinci SI released in April 2009 cost about $1.75 million. In addition, there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery. Surgical procedures performed with the robot take longer than traditional ones. Critics have pointed out that hospitals have a hard time recovering the cost and that most clinical data does not support the claim of improved patient outcomes.[10]
Criticism[edit]
On May 19, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. of Goleta, California filed suit against Intuitive Surgical alleging infringement by Intuitive Surgical of seven U.S. patents relating to robotic surgery.[13]
While the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services, critics point out a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery.[14] On the other hand, there is no question[citation needed] that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to "minimally invasive" endoscopic procedures with the use of the Da Vinci, shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times. But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system, it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used. Data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified. Another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results. These, however, may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience.[14] And there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system.[citation needed]
On the other hand, as more surgeons are being trained on DaVinci systems from the outset of their careers, it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful DaVinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop. Good hand-eye coordination, a talent for tissue handling, and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the DaVinci interface. The difficult learning curve of "handling" the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy. These obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy. This translates into a more relaxed and 'in-control" surgeon who may suffer fewer of the long-term physical consequences that result from prolonged standing, precarious balancing, and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgery.[citation needed] And finally, DaVinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to non-robotic laparoscopy only.[citation needed] It is clear[citation needed] that non-robotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques.
Hospitals with successful DaVinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantly[clarification needed] higher with robotic surgery. Greater numbers of patients, especially those that suffer from obesity, can undergo a safe robotic operation, whereas before, non-surgical options were emphasized for those with high BMI values. One advantage to DaVinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options to more individuals.

History[edit]
The research that eventually led to the development of the da Vinci Surgical System was performed in the late 1980s at non-profit research institute SRI International.[5] In 1990, SRI received funding from the National Institutes of Health. SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield.
In 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it, to no avail. In 1995, Moll was introduced to John Freund, who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc. At that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital. Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]
The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as "Lenny" (after the young Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named "Leonardo", and another was "Mona". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States.[citation needed]
The company raised $46 million in an initial public offering in 2000. That same year, the FDA approved use of the da Vinci Surgical System for general laparoscopic surgery, which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease. In 2001, the FDA approved use of the system for prostate surgery. The FDA has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery, cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions, and gynecologic procedures.[6]
Shortly before going public, Intuitive Surgical was sued for patent infringement by Computer Motion, Inc, its chief rival. Computer Motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than Intuitive Surgical, with its own system, the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System. Although the ZEUS system was approved in Europe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the FDA first approved the da Vinci system. The uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each company's growth. In 2003, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion agreed to merge, thus ending the litigation between them.[7] The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system.
Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500),[8] primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014).

The da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system. The system is controlled by a surgeon from a console. It is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.[9][10]
Overview[edit]
The da Vinci System has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy, in which the surgeon operates while standing, using hand-held, long-shafted instruments, which have no wrists. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console. Three of the arms are for tools that hold objects, act as a scalpel, scissors, bovie, or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments. The fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console. The surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a 3-D image of the procedure, meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers. Right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize, coagulate, or cut the tissue. Left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away. The da Vinci System scales, filters and translates the surgeon's hand movements into more precise micro-movements of the instruments, which operate through small incisions in the body.
By providing surgeons with superior visualization, enhanced dexterity, greater precision and ergonomic comfort, the da Vinci Surgical System makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction. For the patient, a da Vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure, including less pain, less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions. Moreover, the da Vinci System can enable a shorter hospital stay, a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities.[11]
A da Vinci Surgical System costs approximately $1.5 million.[12] The new da Vinci SI released in April 2009 cost about $1.75 million. In addition, there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery. Surgical procedures performed with the robot take longer than traditional ones. Critics have pointed out that hospitals have a hard time recovering the cost and that most clinical data does not support the claim of improved patient outcomes.[10]
Criticism[edit]
On May 19, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. of Goleta, California filed suit against Intuitive Surgical alleging infringement by Intuitive Surgical of seven U.S. patents relating to robotic surgery.[13]
While the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services, critics point out a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery.[14] On the other hand, there is no question[citation needed] that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to "minimally invasive" endoscopic procedures with the use of the Da Vinci, shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times. But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system, it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used. Data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified. Another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results. These, however, may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience.[14] And there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system.[citation needed]
On the other hand, as more surgeons are being trained on DaVinci systems from the outset of their careers, it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful DaVinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop. Good hand-eye coordination, a talent for tissue handling, and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the DaVinci interface. The difficult learning curve of "handling" the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy. These obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy. This translates into a more relaxed and 'in-control" surgeon who may suffer fewer of the long-term physical consequences that result from prolonged standing, precarious balancing, and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgery.[citation needed] And finally, DaVinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to non-robotic laparoscopy only.[citation needed] It is clear[citation needed] that non-robotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques.
Hospitals with successful DaVinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantly[clarification needed] higher with robotic surgery. Greater numbers of patients, especially those that suffer from obesity, can undergo a safe robotic operation, whereas before, non-surgical options were emphasized for those with high BMI values. One advantage to DaVinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options to more individuals.

How Risky Is Intuitive Surgical Inc.?
The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system has been soaring, but there are reasons to fear turbulence ahead.











                Keith Speights
            

                (TMFFishBiz)

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stock is on a roll so far in 2017. Shares of the robotic surgical system developer are up more than 40% year to date, and recently hit an all-time high.
The obvious question for investors when a stock has been enjoying the kind of tremendous momentum that Intuitive Surgical has recently is: Can it last? The answer depends on the level of risk that's associated with investing in the stock. How risky is Intuitive Surgical right now?

Not too risky?
There's a good case to be made that Intuitive Surgical isn't very risky at all from a business perspective. Demand for its da Vinci robotic surgical systems is growing steadily. In 2016, around 753,000 surgical procedures were performed across the world with da Vinci, up more than 15% from the prior year. In the U.S., general surgery is the system's fastest-growing specialty. This includes hernia repair, colorectal procedures, and gallbladder removal. Outside of the U.S., urology procedures generated the most growth.
Hospitals that buy the da Vinci system have an inherent motivation to maximize the value of their investment. As a result, they perform as many procedures as they can using it. This benefits Intuitive Surgical because the company sells instruments and accessories for the system that either wear out frequently or are disposable. Last year, recurring revenue primarily from these sales accounted for 71% of its total revenue.
The company also stands to benefit from demographic trends. Over the next few years, the two largest U.S. generations -- baby boomers and millennials -- will hit the age ranges in which several of the most common da Vinci-assisted procedures are most likely to be required.
While Intuitive Surgical should be able to count on growing recurring revenue from these factors, it should also be in good position to sell plenty of new systems. Less than 35% of da Vinci surgical systems sold have been installed outside of the U.S., which means a large international market remains for the company to pursue. Intuitive Surgical is also exploring new and more complex types of procedures for da Vinci, which should open the door to additional sales opportunities.

Very risky?
Investors with a bearish view on Intuitive Surgical would be quick to point out that the company's growth was achieved during a period where there wasn't much competition. That's about to change -- and it could mean that Intuitive Surgical is at more risk than it's ever been before.
Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) could be the most formidable rival waiting in the wings. The medical-device company's market cap is more than three times that of Intuitive Surgical, and it expects to launch its own robotic surgical system next year. And the company has inroads with more hospitals across the world than Intuitive Surgical does.
Then there's the potential disruptive innovator, Verb Surgical. It's a joint venture between Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Verb Surgical probably won't have a product on the market until 2020, but when it arrives, it could be a game-changer. The company plans to connect machine learning, robotic surgery, instrumentation, advanced visualization, and data analytics together in a way no other company has attempted.
While competitors could present a business risk to Intuitive Surgical, the hazard to its stock price could be even greater. Intuitive Surgical shares trade at a premium valuation of more than 33 times expected earnings. Its growth prospects are solid, but they don't make the stock look more attractive. Intuitive Surgical's PEG ratio is 3.55 -- a very high level. Given the stock's ambitious valuation, it could take a steep hit if the broader market goes through a correction. 





The best answer
My view is that the best way to assess Intuitive Surgical's risk is to look at the question in terms of short-term risk versus long-term risk. Over the short term, its business seems to be at low risk, thanks to the solid recurring revenue and trends discussed earlier. It's possible that the stock could decline, but smart investors won't be too concerned about temporary pullbacks.
Over the long term, the company does face increased risk as more competitors enter the market. However, my guess at this point is that the risk is only moderate. Intuitive Surgical enjoys a long history in the robotic surgical systems market that should give it a competitive advantage. I expect the company to continue to develop new technologies that will allow it to compete effectively against new rivals.
How risky is Intuitive Surgical? For now, I'd say not too risky. But investors should keep their eyes on Medtronic and Verb Surgical.

History[edit]
The research that eventually led to the development of the da Vinci Surgical System was performed in the late 1980s at non-profit research institute SRI International.[5] In 1990, SRI received funding from the National Institutes of Health. SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield.
In 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it, to no avail. In 1995, Moll was introduced to John Freund, who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc. At that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital. Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]
The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as "Lenny" (after the young Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named "Leonardo", and another was "Mona". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States.[citation needed]
The company raised $46 million in an initial public offering in 2000. That same year, the FDA approved use of the da Vinci Surgical System for general laparoscopic surgery, which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease. In 2001, the FDA approved use of the system for prostate surgery. The FDA has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery, cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions, and gynecologic procedures.[6]
Shortly before going public, Intuitive Surgical was sued for patent infringement by Computer Motion, Inc, its chief rival. Computer Motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than Intuitive Surgical, with its own system, the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System. Although the ZEUS system was approved in Europe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the FDA first approved the da Vinci system. The uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each company's growth. In 2003, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion agreed to merge, thus ending the litigation between them.[7] The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system.
Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500),[8] primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014).
da Vinci Surgical System[edit]

Robotic surgery


The da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system. The system is controlled by a surgeon from a console. It is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.[9][10]
Overview[edit]
The da Vinci System has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy, in which the surgeon operates while standing, using hand-held, long-shafted instruments, which have no wrists. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console. Three of the arms are for tools that hold objects, act as a scalpel, scissors, bovie, or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments. The fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console. The surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a 3-D image of the procedure, meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers. Right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize, coagulate, or cut the tissue. Left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away. The da Vinci System scales, filters and translates the surgeon's hand movements into more precise micro-movements of the instruments, which operate through small incisions in the body.
By providing surgeons with superior visualization, enhanced dexterity, greater precision and ergonomic comfort, the da Vinci Surgical System makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction. For the patient, a da Vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure, including less pain, less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions. Moreover, the da Vinci System can enable a shorter hospital stay, a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities.[11]
A da Vinci Surgical System costs approximately $1.5 million.[12] The new da Vinci SI released in April 2009 cost about $1.75 million. In addition, there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery. Surgical procedures performed with the robot take longer than traditional ones. Critics have pointed out that hospitals have a hard time recovering the cost and that most clinical data does not support the claim of improved patient outcomes.[10]
Criticism[edit]
On May 19, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. of Goleta, California filed suit against Intuitive Surgical alleging infringement by Intuitive Surgical of seven U.S. patents relating to robotic surgery.[13]
While the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services, critics point out a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery.[14] On the other hand, there is no question[citation needed] that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to "minimally invasive" endoscopic procedures with the use of the Da Vinci, shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times. But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system, it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used. Data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified. Another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results. These, however, may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience.[14] And there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system.[citation needed]
On the other hand, as more surgeons are being trained on DaVinci systems from the outset of their careers, it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful DaVinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop. Good hand-eye coordination, a talent for tissue handling, and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the DaVinci interface. The difficult learning curve of "handling" the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy. These obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy. This translates into a more relaxed and 'in-control" surgeon who may suffer fewer of the long-term physical consequences that result from prolonged standing, precarious balancing, and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgery.[citation needed] And finally, DaVinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to non-robotic laparoscopy only.[citation needed] It is clear[citation needed] that non-robotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques.
Hospitals with successful DaVinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantly[clarification needed] higher with robotic surgery. Greater numbers of patients, especially those that suffer from obesity, can undergo a safe robotic operation, whereas before, non-surgical options were emphasized for those with high BMI values. One advantage to DaVinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options to more individuals.

But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system, it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used. Data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified. Another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results. These, however, may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience.[14] And there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system.[citation needed]
On the other hand, as more surgeons are being trained on DaVinci systems from the outset of their careers, it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful DaVinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop. Good hand-eye coordination, a talent for tissue handling, and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the DaVinci interface. The difficult learning curve of "handling" the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy. These obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy. This translates into a more relaxed and 'in-control" surgeon who may suffer fewer of the long-term physical consequences that result from prolonged standing, precarious balancing, and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgery.[citation needed] And finally, DaVinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to non-robotic laparoscopy only.[citation needed] It is clear[citation needed] that non-robotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques.
Hospitals with successful DaVinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantly[clarification needed] higher with robotic surgery. Greater numbers of patients, especially those that suffer from obesity, can undergo a safe robotic operation, whereas before, non-surgical options were emphasized for those with high BMI values. One advantage to DaVinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options to more individuals.

History[edit]
The research that eventually led to the development of the da Vinci Surgical System was performed in the late 1980s at non-profit research institute SRI International.[5] In 1990, SRI received funding from the National Institutes of Health. SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield.
In 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it, to no avail. In 1995, Moll was introduced to John Freund, who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc. At that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital. Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]
The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as "Lenny" (after the young Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named "Leonardo", and another was "Mona". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States.[citation needed]
The company raised $46 million in an initial public offering in 2000. That same year, the FDA approved use of the da Vinci Surgical System for general laparoscopic surgery, which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease. In 2001, the FDA approved use of the system for prostate surgery. The FDA has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery, cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions, and gynecologic procedures.[6]
Shortly before going public, Intuitive Surgical was sued for patent infringement by Computer Motion, Inc, its chief rival. Computer Motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than Intuitive Surgical, with its own system, the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System. Although the ZEUS system was approved in Europe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the FDA first approved the da Vinci system. The uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each company's growth. In 2003, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion agreed to merge, thus ending the litigation between them.[7] The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system.
Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500),[8] primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014).

The da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system. The system is controlled by a surgeon from a console. It is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.[9][10]
Overview[edit]
The da Vinci System has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy, in which the surgeon operates while standing, using hand-held, long-shafted instruments, which have no wrists. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console. Three of the arms are for tools that hold objects, act as a scalpel, scissors, bovie, or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments. The fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console. The surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a 3-D image of the procedure, meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers. Right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize, coagulate, or cut the tissue. Left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away. The da Vinci System scales, filters and translates the surgeon's hand movements into more precise micro-movements of the instruments, which operate through small incisions in the body.
By providing surgeons with superior visualization, enhanced dexterity, greater precision and ergonomic comfort, the da Vinci Surgical System makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction. For the patient, a da Vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure, including less pain, less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions. Moreover, the da Vinci System can enable a shorter hospital stay, a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities.[11]
A da Vinci Surgical System costs approximately $1.5 million.[12] The new da Vinci SI released in April 2009 cost about $1.75 million. In addition, there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery. Surgical procedures performed with the robot take longer than traditional ones. Critics have pointed out that hospitals have a hard time recovering the cost and that most clinical data does not support the claim of improved patient outcomes.[10]
Criticism[edit]
On May 19, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. of Goleta, California filed suit against Intuitive Surgical alleging infringement by Intuitive Surgical of seven U.S. patents relating to robotic surgery.[13]
While the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services, critics point out a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery.[14] On the other hand, there is no question[citation needed] that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to "minimally invasive" endoscopic procedures with the use of the Da Vinci, shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times. But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system, it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used. Data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified. Another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results. These, however, may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience.[14] And there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system.[citation needed]
On the other hand, as more surgeons are being trained on DaVinci systems from the outset of their careers, it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful DaVinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop. Good hand-eye coordination, a talent for tissue handling, and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the DaVinci interface. The difficult learning curve of "handling" the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy. These obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy. This translates into a more relaxed and 'in-control" surgeon who may suffer fewer of the long-term physical consequences that result from prolonged standing, precarious balancing, and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgery.[citation needed] And finally, DaVinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to non-robotic laparoscopy only.[citation needed] It is clear[citation needed] that non-robotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques.
Hospitals with successful DaVinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantly[clarification needed] higher with robotic surgery. Greater numbers of patients, especially those that suffer from obesity, can undergo a safe robotic operation, whereas before, non-surgical options were emphasized for those with high BMI values. One advantage to DaVinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options to more individuals.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
