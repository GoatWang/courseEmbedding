Clark Kinlin Named Head Of Corning’s Telecommunications Group






Business Wire




Jul 19, 2012 5:05 PM EDT













 




























































  Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced that its Board of Directors has elected Clark S. Kinlin to the position of executive vice president, Corning Telecommunications business group, effective Aug. 1, 2012. The group comprises Corning Optical Fiber and Corning Cable Systems.  Kinlin, 52, will report to Wendell P. Weeks, chairman, chief executive officer, and president of Corning Incorporated. Kinlin will continue the day-to-day management responsibility for Corning Cable Systems. He was appointed president and chief operating officer of the cable division in April 2008.  Kinlin joined Corning in 1981 and has worked in a variety of businesses, including Corning Consumer Products and Corning International. Based in China for several years, Kinlin led the growth of Corning’s business in China and established a strong corporate operating platform. He also led the commercial entry of the telecommunications business into Japan and China. He received his undergraduate degree from Kenyon College and received a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University.  Corning’s board also elected Stephen P. Miller, 43, as vice president and general manager, Corning Optical Fiber and Cable, reporting to Kinlin. The role is effective Aug. 1, 2012. Most recently, Miller served as senior vice president and chief financial officer for Corning Cable Systems. He joined Corning in 1995 and has held several roles in finance across a number of business organizations. He spent several years in Japan as the Display Technologies division controller. He has a bachelor’s degree in accounting from SUNY College at Fredonia.  Corning’s new telecommunications business group addresses a global need for an integrated go-to-market strategy in emerging markets; an opportunity to capture significant operating synergies, and scale and optimization of manufacturing and technology assets.  Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements  This press release contains “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995), which are based on current expectations and assumptions about Corning’s financial results and business operations, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: the effect of global political, economic and business conditions; conditions in the financial and credit markets; currency fluctuations; tax rates; product demand and industry capacity; competition; reliance on a concentrated customer base; manufacturing efficiencies; cost reductions; availability of critical components and materials; new product commercialization; pricing fluctuations and changes in the mix of sales between premium and non-premium products; new plant start-up or restructuring costs; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political or financial instability, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, or major health concerns; adequacy of insurance; equity company activities; acquisition and divestiture activities; the level of excess or obsolete inventory; the rate of technology change; the ability to enforce patents; product and components performance issues; retention of key personnel; stock price fluctuations; and adverse litigation or regulatory developments. These and other risk factors are detailed in Corning’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the day that they are made, and Corning undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.
