Forward-Looking Statements


      All statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the 
      subjects of this release) other than historical facts are 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking 
      statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and 
      are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are 
      outside Exterran Corporation’s (“Exterran”) control, which could cause 
      actual results to differ materially from such statements. 
      Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, Exterran’s 
      expectations regarding its financial and operational strategies and its 
      prospects for long-term growth and profitability and creation of 
      shareholder value.
    

      While Exterran believes that the assumptions concerning future events 
      are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in 
      predicting certain important factors that could impact the future 
      performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could 
      cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are: local, regional, national and 
      international economic conditions and the impact they may have on 
      Exterran and its customers; conditions in the oil and gas industry, 
      including a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for oil 
      or natural gas or a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural 
      gas; Exterran’s ability to timely and cost-effectively execute larger 
      projects; changes in political or economic conditions in key operating 
      markets, including international markets; any non-performance by third 
      parties of their contractual obligations; and changes in safety, health, 
      environmental and other regulations.
    

      These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, 
      forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in 
      Exterran Holdings’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
      December 31, 2014, Exterran’s Registration Statement on Form 10 and 
      Exterran’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which 
      are available at www.exterran.com. 
      Except as required by law, Exterran expressly disclaims any intention or 
      obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as 
      a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

James Gouin
						CFOTower Automotive L.L.C. Livonia
					

CFOTower Automotive L.L.C. Livonia Even though Livonia-based Tower Automotive L.L.C. is a private company, owned by former Chrysler L.L.C. parent Cerberus Capital Management L.P., the Securities and Exchange Commission is welcome anytime. That's because CFO James Gouin rebuilt Tower's entire financial system after joining the company in November 2007, following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the previous July. “It was a huge change,” Gouin said. “When I came here I would say that the control environment was virtually nonexistent — everything from policies and procedures or even, "What is internal control?' “ The company, which posts about $2.5 billion in annual revenue, is now Sarbanes-Oxley-compliant, produces full reports required by the SEC, such as forms 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K, has the oversight of disclosure and enterprise risk-management committees and a complete internal control and quality oversight system — in roughly a single year. That's not as easy as flipping a switch. Some consider SEC-style reporting and control to be onerous, expensive practices. “But ... the governance it drives and the control it drives down deep into business is really the way you should run the business,” he said. The uncertainties about the long-term future prospects that come along with private-equity ownership also make the controls worthwhile. “Since we don't know what the ultimate exit is from Cerberus — who knows, it could be a public offering, it could be a consolidation or a roll-up, but either way, we'll be ready,” he said. Gouin, 49, knows the demands, and benefits, of public-company reporting requirements from the ground up. He got his first job with Ford Motor Co. as an accounts payable clerk at Ford's Essex engine plant when he was 19. He worked his way up the ranks of Ford's financial hierarchy, with stints in marketing and sales, manufacturing, product development and other areas until he was CFO of Ford's North American operations and vice president and corporate controller for Ford's global operations. He left Ford in March 2007 to establish the Detroit office of FTI Consulting as a senior managing director at the firm. Then, the opportunity to join Tower came along. “To come into a company that's much smaller where you can really, really have an influence is what I saw here at Tower, and I saw a tremendous opportunity for value creation longer-term.” — Ryan Beene
