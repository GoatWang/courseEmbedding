About Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group
Diversified Collection of Luxury Assets Anchored by Non-Leveraged Argentina Real Estate Holdings.Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. (Algodon Group) is a U.S. based public company that owns and develops luxury real estate assets in Argentina.  We are among the first real estate developers in Argentina to report on a U.S. stock market (OTCQB: VINO), and our non-leveraged assets provide one of the few public vehicles to participate in the anticipated growth in value of Argentina real estate. Algodon Group is the only publicly traded luxury development brand with unleveraged real estate, premium wines, and luxury lifestyle assets currently focused on Argentina.Algodon seeks to become the LVMH of South America with our initial collection of assets beginning in Argentina, due to its value proposition and current opportunities.  Algodon is an emerging luxury brand, currently consisting of a collection of offerings that includes Algodon Fine Wines, Algodon Wine Estates, Algodon Wine & Wellness Resort, Algodon Mansion, and Algodon Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Our mission is to utilize the value inherent in our non-leveraged luxury assets and real estate as a base to roll up and acquire additional assets directly related to the future growth of our brand. Algodon's winemakers work diligently towards the goal of our brand becoming synonymous with the best Malbec and Malbec blends in the world, which we believe may significantly advance the value of the Algodon luxury brand; one of quality, elegance and attention to detail.  With our fines wines as our ambassador, we identify and develop unique lifestyle properties, vineyard operations and other real estate assets, as well as luxury brands in Argentina, and may potentially expand in the future to other vital areas of South America and around the globe. We are opportunistic investors with an entrepreneurial spirit and a contrarian investment philosophy.Our current luxury portfolio includes the vineyards and winery of Algodon Wine Estates in San Rafael, Mendoza, which has received international accolades for Algodon Fine Wines, and which includes 325 acres (131 hectares) of vines dating back to 1946, as well as a 2,050 acre (830 hectare) luxury real estate development with over 400 estate lots (ranging from .5 to 7 acres), and Algodon Wines & Wellness Resort, a developing premier wine, wellness, culinary, and sport resort that includes golf and tennis facilities, an all-suite boutique hotel in Buenos Aires, called Algodon Mansion, located in the heart of the city’s luxury residential and embassy district, and Algodon Olive Oil, the estate grown and award-winning extra virgin olive oil that has been expertly blended to complement our wines.Investing in Argentina before the crowd since 2007, Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. is headquartered in New York City, with offices in Buenos Aires and Mendoza.Why Invest in Argentina?

HistoryAlgodon Group is a Delaware corporation originally formed in April 1999 under the name InvestPrivate.com, Inc. The Company later changed its name to Diversified Private Equity Corp. in order to reflect its evolution from an Internet-based brokerage firm into a retail brokerage firm focusing on the marketing of private offerings and a developer of international real estate projects. Continuing its growth and evolution, the Company has transitioned from a diversified private equity platform to a wine brand and a luxury real estate development company under the “Algodon” brand, and is now more widely recognized as “Algodon,” hence the Company’s new name, “Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc.” or Algodon Group. “Algodon,” which has received a significant amount of international press for its luxury hotel properties, wines and real estate development, is the name that most of the Company’s investors and customers are familiar with, and is likely the identity under which the Company will receive press in the years ahead.From the Company’s inception, its goal has consistently been to provide entrepreneurial and institutional investment opportunities to qualified or accredited investors to whom such opportunities historically were unavailable. Under current SEC regulations, there are millions of investors in the United States who can participate in the private equity products that Algodon Group offers, and we believe that the investment products Algodon Group structures will be attractive to many qualified investors.Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Algodon Group currently invests in, develops and operates international real estate projects. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, DPEC Capital, is a traditional retail securities brokerage firm which offers various non-public investment opportunities to qualified investors. Since approximately 2004, DPEC Capital has concentrated its efforts on raising money for investment vehicles that were formed by its corporate affiliates, many of which were in the biotech sector, for corporate affiliates that were raising capital to invest in the various projects being developed in Argentina, or for other operating businesses under common control with Algodon Group.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K filing. References in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to "us," "we," "our," and similar terms refer to Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation. This discussion includes forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the federal securities laws, based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. Words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements.  We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond our control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based. See "Special Note - Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K filing. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.  Overview  We are an integrated, lifestyle related real estate development company, capitalizing on our unique brand of affordable luxury, branded as "Algodon", to create a diverse set of interrelated products and services. Our wines, hotels and real estate ventures, currently concentrated in Argentina, offer a blend of high-end, luxury and adventures products. We hope to further broaden the reach and depth of our services to strengthen and cement the reach of our brand. Ultimately, we intend to further expand and grow our business by combining unique and promising opportunities with our brand and clientele.  Through our subsidiaries, we currently operate Algodon Mansion, a Buenos Aires-based luxury boutique hotel property and we have redeveloped, expanded and repositioned a winery and golf resort property called Algodon Wine Estates for subdivision of a portion of this property for residential development.  Developments and Trends  Investment in foreign real estate requires consideration of certain risks typically not associated with investing in the United States. Such risks include, trade balances and imbalances and related economic policies, unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of exchange control regulation by the United States or foreign governments, United States and foreign withholding taxes, limitations on the removal of funds or other assets, policies of governments with respect to possible nationalization of their industries, political difficulties, including expropriation of assets, confiscatory taxation and economic or political instability in foreign nations or changes in laws which affect foreign investors. See also Item 1A-Risk Factors for more information.  In December 2011, the Argentine Congress passed Law 26.737 (Regime for Protection of National Domain over Ownership, Possession or Tenure of Rural Land) limiting foreign ownership of rural land, even when not in border areas, to a maximum of 15 percent of all national, provincial or departmental productive land. Every non-Argentine national must request permission from the National Land Registry of Argentina in order to acquire non-urban real property. Additionally, no foreign individual or entity can acquire more than 30 percent within the allowed 15 percent of the total land of the department.  As approved, the law has been in effect since February 28, 2012 but is not retroactive. Furthermore, the general limit of 15 percent ownership by non-nationals must be reached before the law is applicable and each provincial government may establish its own maximum area of ownership per non-national.  In the Mendoza province, the maximum area allowed per type of production and activity per non-national is as follows: Mining-25,000 hectares (61,776 acres), cattle ranching-18,000 hectares (44,479 acres), cultivation of fruit or vines-15,000 hectares (37,066 acres), horticulture-7,000 hectares (17,297 acres), private lot-200 hectares (494 acres), and other-1,000 hectares (2,471 acres). A hectare is a unit of area in the metric system equal to approximately 2.471 acres. However, these maximums will only be considered if the total 15 percent is reached. Although currently, the area under foreign ownership in Mendoza is approximately 8.6 percent, this law may apply to the Company in the future, and could affect the Company's ability to acquire additional real property in Argentina. Currently, the Company owns Argentine rural land through two legal entities, including one entity that owns 780 hectares (1,880 acres) and another that owns 54 hectares (130 acres), all of which is considered land held for cultivation of fruit or vines. Because the maximum area for this type of land allowed per non-national is 25,000 hectares, the Company is compliant with the law's limit, were it to apply today. Costs of compliance with the law may be significant in the future.  Currently AWLD is developing lots for sale to third party builders and is not engaged in any construction activity. Twenty-one lots have been sold, and the Company expects to close on the sale of these lots and record the deeds during 2017. To date, no deeds have been issued. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has $1,652,180 of lot deposits for pending sales.  As reflected in our consolidated financial statements we have generated significant losses from operations (continuing) of $6,560,871 and $6,109,812 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses, raising substantial doubt that we will be able to continue operations as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report for these years stating that we have not achieved a sufficient level of revenues to support our business and have suffered recurring losses from operations. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent upon our generating cash flow and obtaining additional debt or equity capital sufficient to fund operations. Our business strategy may not be successful in addressing these issues and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional capital. If we cannot execute our business plan (including acquiring additional capital), our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us. If we are able to obtain additional debt or equity capital (of which there can be no assurance), we hope to acquire additional management as well as increase marketing our products and continue the development of our real estate holdings.  Financings  In 2016 and 2015, we raised, net of repayments, approximately $7,056,000 and $6,181,000, respectively of new capital through the issuance of debt and equity. We used the net proceeds from the closings of these private placement offerings for general working capital and capital expenditures.  Initiatives  We have implemented a number of initiatives designed to expand revenues and control costs. Revenue enhancement initiatives include expanding marketing, investment in additional winery capacity and developing new real estate development revenue sources. Cost reduction initiatives include investment in equipment that will decrease our reliance on subcontractors, plus outsourcing and restructuring of certain functions. Our goal is to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on outside financing.  Quotation on OTC Bulletin Board  On January 20, 2016 FINRA cleared the request to submit quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board and in OTC Link by Glendale Securities, Inc. of Sherman Oaks, California. In addition, the Company submitted its application for quotation on the OTCQB marketplace and was approved on March 7, 2016. The first trade on the over-the-counter market occurred on September 23, 2016.  Consolidated Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 The following table represents selected items in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively: For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Sales $ 1,526,075 $ 1,866,685 Cost of sales (1,760,451 ) (2,225,813 ) Gross loss (234,376 ) (359,128 ) Operating Expenses Selling and marketing 154,626 220,019 General and administrative 6,107,016 5,306,383 Depreciation and amortization 64,853 224,282 Total operating expenses 6,326,495 5,750,684 Loss from Operations (6,560,871 ) (6,109,812 ) Other Expenses Interest expense, net 207,913 319,748 Common Stock price modification 941,530 - Warrant modification expenses 89,549 - Total other expenses 1,238,992 319,748 Loss from Continuing Operations (7,799,863 ) (6,429,560 ) Loss from Discontinued Operations (2,242,278 ) (1,849,404 ) Net Loss $ (10,042,141 ) $ (8,278,964 )  Overview  We reported net losses from continuing operations of approximately $7.8 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting an increase of approximately $1.4 million or 21%. Our results were impacted by both the devaluation of the Argentine Peso and decreases in operating expenses, partially offset by increases in common stock price modification expense, and warrant modification expense.  Revenues  Revenues from continuing operations were approximately $1.5 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting a decrease of approximately $341 thousand or 18%. Decreases in revenues primarily resulted from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso ("ARS") vis-�-vis the U.S. dollar during 2016. There was an average devaluation of the Argentine peso from 9.25 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 14.76 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which decreased the average worth of the Argentine peso from US $0.11 to $0.07. Increases in hotel and wine and revenues of $732,000 were offset by $1,073,000 decrease in revenues resulting from the impact of the decline in value of the Argentine peso vis-�-vis the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.  Total sales from Argentina were ARS $26.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to ARS $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting a net increase of approximately ARS $9.4 million or 55%. Hotel room and event revenues were approximately ARS $12.5 million and ARS $7.9 million during both years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, representing an increase of approximately ARS $4.6 million, or 58.6% due to higher occupancy and average room rates. Restaurant revenues were approximately ARS $4.7 million and 4.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Argentine winemaking revenues were approximately ARS $7.7 million and 3.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of approximately ARS $4.4 million or 131.8%, resulting from an expansion of distribution channels and additional investments in marketing and sales staff. Other revenues, including golf, tennis and agricultural revenues, were ARS $1.7 million and ARS $1.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of ARS $0.6 million is primarily due to an increase in agricultural revenues.  Gross loss  We generated a gross loss of approximately $234,000 from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a gross loss of approximately $359,000 from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of $125,000 or 35%. The variance results primarily from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis-�-vis the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.  Cost of sales, which consists of raw materials, direct labor and indirect labor associated with our business activities, decreased by $465,000 from $2,226,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,761,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $603,000 increase in wine and hotel costs was offset by a $1,068,000 decrease in cost of sales resulting from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis-�-vis the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.  The restaurant and golf and tennis business units at AWE realized negative margins in 2016 and 2015, due to significant fixed costs (i.e. depreciation on golf courses and tennis courts) related to these business units. The restaurant and golf and tennis are kept open every day at a loss, in order to support the image of the winery. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $91,000 and $193,000, respectively, in inventory write-down as the result significant hailstorms which damaged vineyard in process.  Selling and marketing expenses  Selling and marketing expenses were approximately $155,000 and $220,000 from continuing operations, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $65,000 or 30%. The decrease is primarily due to expenses incurred during 2015 related to a marketing event to promote our international wine sales, including meeting with potential importers and distributors, as well as potential wine clients and investors in China, the Middle East and Europe.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses were approximately $6,107,000 and $5,306,000 from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $801,000 or 15%. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily related to $872,615 increase in stock-based compensation related to stock and warrants granted to consultants in exchange for services, and $304,000 increase in commission expenses, partially offset by decreases in compensation expense resulting from headcount reductions and the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis-�-vis the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.  Depreciation and amortization expense  Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $65,000 and $225,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of approximately $160,000 or 71%. It should be noted that approximately an additional $103,000 and $169,000 of depreciation and amortization expense was capitalized to inventory during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Most of our property and equipment is located in Argentina and the gross cost being depreciated declined year-over-year due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar.  Interest expense, net  Interest expense was approximately $208,000 and $320,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $112,000, or 35%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in amounts due under payment plans for Argentine taxes, as well as decreases in convertible debt interest during the period, as well as decreases resulting from to the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar.  Discontinued Operations  On November 29, 2016, our Board of Directors determined that it was in the Company's best interest to close down DPEC Capital and we ceased our broker-dealer operations December 31, 2016. On February 21, 2017, our request to FINRA for Broker-Dealer Withdrawal ("BDW") became effective.  AWLD also owned approximately 96.5% of Mercari Communications Group, Ltd. ("Mercari"), a public shell corporation current in its SEC reporting obligations. On December 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a Purchaser, whereby the Purchaser agreed to purchase all of our shares or Mercari for $260,000. The sale of Mercari stock was completed on January 20, 2017 and we received net proceeds after expenses of $199,250.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We measure our liquidity in variety of ways, including the following:   For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Cash $ 131,190 $ 110,645 Working Capital Deficiency $ (1,643,034 ) $ (1,477,183 )  Based upon our working capital situation as of December 31, 2016, we require additional equity and/or debt financing in order to sustain operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have relied primarily on private placement equity offerings to third party independent, accredited investors to sustain operations. These offerings were conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiary DPEC Capital, Inc. which was discontinued at year end.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 3,146,875 shares of common stock at prices from $2.00 to $2.50 per share for cash proceeds of $7,097,862. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 2,821,942 shares of common stock at $2.00 per share for cash proceeds of $5,643,884 and issued 274,860 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share for cash proceeds of $687,150. On June 1, 2016, the Company issued an additional 470,771 common shares for no consideration, to investors who had purchased shares between December 2015 and May 2016 at a price of $2.50 per share, in order to effectively reduce the per share price to $2.00 per share. All shares were issued to accredited investors in private placement transactions.  The proceeds from these financing activities were used to fund our existing operating deficits, expenditures associated with our real estate development projects, enhanced marketing efforts to increase revenues and the general working capital needs of the business. We will need to raise additional capital in order to meet our future liquidity needs for operating expenses, capital expenditures for the winery expansion and to further invest in our real estate development. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations.  Sources and Uses of Cash for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounted to approximately $6,470,000 and $6,538,000, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016 the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately $10,042,000, adjusted for approximately $3,821,000 of non-cash expenses and $248,000 cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015 the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately $8,279,000, adjusted for approximately $1,674,000 of non-cash expenses and $67,000 cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $549,000 and $470,000, respectively, and was related to the purchase of property and equipment.  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $7,056,000 and $6,181,000, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of equity securities for net proceeds of approximately $7,098,000 and proceeds from loans payable of approximately $68,000, partially offset by net repayments of debt of approximately $110,000. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of equity securities for net proceeds of approximately $6,331,000, partially offset by net repayments of debt of approximately $150,000.  Going Concern and Management's Liquidity Plans  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have not achieved a sufficient level of revenues to support our business and development activities and have suffered substantial recurring losses from operations since our inception, which conditions raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue operations as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern.  Based on current cash on hand and subsequent activity as described herein, our cash-on-hand only allows us to operate our business operations on a month-to-month basis. Because of our limited cash availability, we have scaled back our operations to the extent possible. While we are exploring opportunities with third parties and related parties to provide some or all of the capital we need, we have not entered into any agreement to provide us with the necessary capital. Historically, the Company has been successful in raising funds to support our capital needs. During the first three months of 2017, we raised additional capital through the sale of convertible promissory notes to accredited investors for total gross proceeds of $1,260,000, and the sale of Series B convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds $150,000. However, if we are unable to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations, liquidate and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code. As a result, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion in conjunction with their audit of our December 31, 2016 and 2015 consolidated financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  None.  Contractual Obligations  As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Use of Estimates  To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the financial statements, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our significant estimates and assumptions are the valuation of equity instruments, the useful lives of property and equipment and reserves associated with the realizability of certain assets.  Foreign Currency Translation  Our functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of the Company's operating subsidiaries are their local currencies (United States dollar, Argentine peso and British pound). There has been a steady devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the United States dollar in recent years. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date, (15.9681 and 12.9441 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) and revenue and expense accounts are translated at a weighted average exchange rate for the period or for the year then ended (14.7590 and 9.2495 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). Resulting translation adjustments are made directly to accumulate other comprehensive income. Losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of $52,528 and $360,170 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are recognized in operating results in the consolidated statements of operations. We engage in foreign currency denominated transactions with customers and suppliers, as well as between subsidiaries with different functional currencies.  A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year period. If a country's economy is classified as highly inflationary, the functional currency of the foreign entity operating in that country must be remeasured to the functional currency of the reporting entity. The cumulative inflation rate for Argentina over the last three years approximated 90.9%, although the International Monetary Fund has concerns regarding the accuracy of the official data.  Inventory  Inventories are comprised primarily of "vineyard in process," "wine in process," "finished wine," plus food and beverage items and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. Costs associated with winemaking, and other costs associated with the creation of products for resale, are recorded as inventory. "Vineyard in process" represents the monthly capitalization of farming expenses (including farming labor costs, usage of farming supplies and depreciation of the vineyard and farming equipment) associated with the growing of grape, olive and other fruits during the farming year which culminates with the February/March harvest. "Wine in process" represents the capitalization of costs during the winemaking process (including the transfer of grape costs from vineyard in process, winemaking labor costs and depreciation of winemaking fixed assets, including tanks, barrels, equipment, tools and the winemaking building). "Finished wines" represents wine available for sale and includes the transfer of costs from wine in process once the wine is bottled and labeled. Other inventory represents olives, other fruits, golf equipment and restaurant food.  . . .  Mar 31, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

CORRECTION - Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc.


/EINPresswire.com/ -- NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - October 14, 2016) -  In the news release, "Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group Partners with Sotheby's International Realty for Exclusive Vineyard Estate Lot Sales at Algodon Wine Estates," issued yesterday by Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. (OTCQB: VINO), we are advised by the company that the headline and first sentence of the first paragraph should read, "Ginevra Sotheby's International Realty," rather than "Sotheby's International Realty," as originally issued. Complete correct text follows. 
Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group Partners With Ginevra Sotheby's International Realty for Exclusive Vineyard Estate Lot Sales at Algodon Wine Estates

Algodon Wine Estates is a 2,050 acre (830 ha) world-class wine, wellness, culinary and sport resort, and luxury real estate development, located in the rolling hills of the Sierra Pintada Mountains in San Rafael, Mendoza, Argentina. This wine and golf community is a global destination that includes approximately 400 lots ranging from .5 to 7 acres, with 109 lots from Phase 1 of the master plan currently available for private sale and development. Surrounded by the natural beauty of vineyards, fruit orchards and olive groves, many lots have pre-existing vines and groves, and a significant number of available Phase 1 lots are situated directly on the estate's 18-hole golf course, offering golf, vineyard and mountain views. The luxury destination is truly unique in the world, where residents can step right outside their front door onto the golf course and find themselves among meticulously manicured vines planted in the 1940s.
Recent momentum with the economic turnaround in Argentina was evidenced during the Argentina Business & Investment Forum held in September by President Mauricio Macri and the Argentina Investment and Trade Promotion Agency. The forum highlighted investment opportunities, attracted foreign direct investment and marked Argentina's historical return to international markets. Foreign direct investment pledges post the investment forum have totaled more than $32.5 billion with Siemens & GE committing to over $15 billion in combined infrastructure projects in 2016.
In the wake of Argentina's recent economic reforms, the Buenos Aires Herold reports that the city's real estate market has experienced its strongest monthly growth in sales since the inauguration of President Mauricio Macri. Real estate transactions in August were up 43.9% for the same month last year, and up 18.4% from July. Experts believe that a key factor in a successfully booming real estate cycle may be linked to the increased use of mortgages, which is on the rise in Argentina.
The Argentine real estate market is traditionally notable for its all cash transactions, and Algodon Wine Estates is one of the few real estate developments in the country that offers financing. 
"We are very excited to be working with Algodon Group. This is truly a great opportunity for both parties as we commercialize and develop the 'Disneyland for Adults' in Mendoza," said Mercedes Ginevra, Ginevra Sotheby's International Realty founder and CEO. "We are confident that, through our extensive network with Sotheby's International Realty, we will truly be able to take this wonderful project to both a large local market, and also an international clientele." 
Founder, Chairman and CEO Scott Mathis added: "We couldn't think of a better partner to market our luxury vineyard estates other than Ginevra Sotheby's International Realty with Mercedes Ginevra´s great team in Buenos Aires. We anticipate the Sotheby's International Realty brand and their global expertise in the luxury real estate market may further open the door for our world-renowned property to potential global buyers. Now wine lovers can buy Argentina vineyard real estate at our luxury residential development, and build a custom luxury home on a private vineyard, golf or equestrian estate while enjoying the privilege of world-class wine production. Mendoza vineyards for sale outmatch international peers in affordability, value, and potential property appreciation."
Algodon Wine Estates currently operates an award-winning wine-themed real estate development and resort with an 18-hole vineyard golf course that plays through the vines, a professional tennis center with the only grass courts in the Mendoza Province, as well as seven clay courts and one hard court, and a restaurant and members' clubhouse. The vineyard property also includes the world-class winery responsible for producing Algodon's collection of internationally award-winning wines, as well as 325 acres (131 ha) of vineyards, with old vines dating back to 1946, which is instrumental in the winery's ability to produce Malbec wines of the highest international caliber. 
Nestled in the southern heart of Argentina wine country, Algodon Wine Estates was recently named one of the world's best vineyard hotels by Frommer's Travel Guide, and one of the world's best wine resorts by Departures Magazine. Most recently the wine estates won the 2016 Vineyard of the Year for San Rafael by Luxury Travel Guide and was also rated by Architectural Digest as one of the world's most Beautiful Hotel Gardens. Algodon Wine Estates' Master Plan model and Brochure can be viewed in person at Sotheby's International Realty's office in New York City and Buenos Aires.

	to reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock from 11,000,000 to 10,097,330.




	 




	Also
	on February 28, 2017, the Company filed the Certificate of Designation of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock designating 902,670
	shares of preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.01 as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Shares”).
	No Series B Shares are currently outstanding. If and when issued (of which there can be no assurance), holders of Series B Preferred
	Shares will be entitled to, among other things, the following:




	 








	●




	8%
	annual dividend, payable quarterly, within thirty (30) following the end of the quarter,
	subject only to a determination by the Company’s Board of Directors that payment
	of dividends would jeopardize the Company’s ongoing operations.

	●




	Upon

	to the number of votes determined by a formula set forth in the certificate of designation,
	subject to a maximum of ten votes per Series B Share. Holders of Series B Shares also
	vote as a class to the extent Series B Shares would be treated differently from another
	series of preferred stock, such as any action that would amend any of the rights, preferences
	or privileges of the holders of Series B Shares, or that would authorize the Company
	to issue a class of preferred stock that would be senior to Series B Shares, and in each
	such instance consent or approval of holders of at least 50.01% of the then outstanding
	Series B Shares would be required for such action to become effective.

	of the termination date of the offering whereby the Corporation offered and sold Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the holder
	of shares of Preferred Stock may elect to convert such shares into fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, except
	that the Company shall not be required to convert less than 2,500 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in the event
	such holder seeks to convert less than all of such holder’s shares. Holders will be notified of the date on which the right
	to voluntarily convert provided for herein shall expire. The number of shares of Common Stock that a holder of Series B Convertible
	Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the Series B Applicable
	Conversion Rate (determined as provided in

	Section 5(b)

	) by the number of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
	being converted at any time.




	 




	(b)

	Applicable
	Conversion Rate

	. The conversion rate in effect at any time for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “

	Series
	B Applicable Conversion Rate

	”) shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $10.00 by the Series B Applicable Conversion
	Value, as defined in

	Section 5(c)

	. Initially, the Series B Applicable Conversion Rate shall be ten (10), and each share
	of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall initially be convertible into ten (10) shares of Common Stock.

	(c)

	Applicable
	Conversion Value

	. The Series B Applicable Conversion Value in effect from time to time, except as adjusted in accordance with

	Section 5(d)

	hereof, shall be $1.00 with respect to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “

	Series B Applicable
	Conversion Value

	”).




	 




	(d)

	Adjustment
	to Series B Applicable Conversion Value

	.




	 




	(i)

	Upon
	Extraordinary Common Stock Event

	. Upon the happening of an Extraordinary Common Stock Event (as hereinafter defined), the
	Series B Applicable Conversion Value (and all other conversion values set forth in

	Section 5(d)(i)

	above) shall, simultaneously
	with the happening of such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, be adjusted by multiplying the Series B Applicable Conversion Value
	by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Extraordinary
	Common Stock Event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
	Extraordinary Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Series B Applicable Conversion Value. The
	Series B Applicable Conversion Value, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any successive
	Extraordinary Common Stock Event or Events. An “

	Extraordinary Common Stock Event

	” shall mean (A) the issuance
	of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding shares of Common Stock, (B) a subdivision
	of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or (C) a combination or reverse stock split
	of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.




	 




	(ii)

	Waiver
	of Adjustment to Series B Applicable Conversion Value.

	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the operation of,
	and any adjustment of the Series B Applicable Conversion Value pursuant to, this

	Section 5(d)

	may be waived with respect
	to any specific share or shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally
	or in a particular instance, by a writing executed by the registered holder of such share or shares. Any waiver pursuant to this

	Section 5(d)(ii)

	shall bind all future holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for which such rights
	have been waived. In the event that a waiver of adjustment of Series B Applicable Conversion Value under this

	Section 5(d)(ii)

	results in different Series B Applicable Conversion Values for shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Secretary
	of the Corporation shall maintain a written ledger identifying the Series B Applicable Conversion Value for each share of Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock. Such information shall be made available to any person upon request.




	 




	(e)

	Mandatory
	or Automatic Conversion

	.




	 




	(i)

	Mandatory
	Conversion of Preferred Stock Upon Uplisting of Corporation’s Common Stock

	. Immediately upon the uplisting of the Corporation’s
	Common Stock to a national securities exchange including but not limited to NASDAQ or NYSE MKT, all outstanding shares of Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
	of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are then convertible pursuant to

	Section 5

	hereof without any further action by
	the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or
	its transfer agent.

	(ii)

	Mandatory
	Conversion of Preferred Stock Upon Merger with Public Company or Comparable Transaction

	. Immediately upon the closing of a
	merger between a company whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act (hereinafter referred to as “PubCo”),
	and the Corporation, or any other transaction in which PubCo effectively acquires all of the outstanding shares of the Corporation,
	all outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically into the number of shares of the
	Corporation’s Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are then convertible pursuant
	to

	Section 5

	hereof without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing
	such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent.




	 




	(iii)

	Surrender
	of Certificates Upon Mandatory Conversion

	. Upon the occurrence of the conversion events specified in the preceding paragraphs
	(i), (ii) or (iii), the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall, upon notice from the Corporation, surrender
	the certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent for the Common Stock. Thereupon,
	there shall be issued and delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into
	which the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered were convertible on the date on which such conversion
	occurred. The Corporation shall not be obligated to issue such certificates unless certificates evidencing the shares of Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or any such transfer agent, or the holder
	notifies the Corporation that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to
	the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith.




	 




	(f)

	Dividends

	.
	In the event the Corporation shall make or issue, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
	entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution (other than a distribution in liquidation or other distribution otherwise
	provided for herein) with respect to the Common Stock payable in (i) securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common
	Stock, or (ii) other assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions), then and in each such event provision shall be made so
	that the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of
	shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the number of securities or such other assets of the Corporation which they would
	have received had their Series B Convertible Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
	they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the Conversion Date (as that term is hereafter
	defined in

	Section 5(j)

	), retained such securities or such other assets receivable by them during such period, giving application
	to all other adjustments called for during such period under this

	Section 5

	with respect to the rights of the holders of
	the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.




	 




	(g)

	Capital
	Reorganization or Reclassification

	. If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred
	Stock shall be changed into the same or different number of shares of any class or classes of capital stock, whether by capital
	reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend
	provided for elsewhere in this

	Section 5

	, or a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s
	capital stock or assets to any other person), then and in each such event the holder of each share of Series B Convertible Preferred
	Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of capital stock and other securities
	and property receivable upon such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other change by the holders of the number
	of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately
	prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

	(h)

	Merger,
	Consolidation or Sale of Assets

	. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a merger or consolidation of the Corporation
	with or into another corporation (other than a merger or reorganization involving only a change in the state of incorporation
	of the Corporation), or the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s capital stock or assets to any other person,
	then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, or consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
	the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from
	such merger or consolidation, to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had converted its shares of Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. In any such case,
	appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this

	Section 5

	to the end that the provisions
	of this

	Section 5

	(including adjustment of the Series B Applicable Conversion Value then in effect and the number of shares
	of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock) shall be
	applicable after that event in as nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable.




	 




	(i)

	Certificate
	as to Adjustments; Notice by Corporation

	. In each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the Series B Applicable Conversion
	Rate, the Corporation at its expense will furnish each holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with a certificate prepared
	by the Treasurer or Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation, showing such adjustment or readjustment, and stating in detail
	the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.




	 




	(j)

	Exercise
	of Conversion Privilege

	. To exercise its conversion privilege, a holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall surrender
	the certificate or certificates representing the shares being converted to the Corporation at its principal office, and shall
	give written notice to the Corporation at that office that such holder elects to convert such shares. Such notice shall also state
	the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock issuable upon
	such conversion shall be issued. The certificate or certificates for shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock surrendered
	for conversion shall be accompanied by proper assignment thereof to the Corporation or in blank. The date when such written notice
	is received by the Corporation, together with the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Convertible
	Preferred Stock being converted, shall be the “

	Conversion Date

	.” As promptly as practicable after the Conversion
	Date, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver to the holder of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock being
	converted, or on its written order, such certificate or certificates as it may request for the number of whole shares of Common
	Stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of
	this

	Section 5

	, rounded up to the nearest whole share as provided in

	Section 5(k)

	, in respect of any fraction of
	a share of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior
	to the close of business on the Conversion Date, and at such time the rights of the holder as holder of the converted shares of
	Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease and the person(s) in whose name(s) any certificate(s) for shares of Common Stock
	shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Common
	Stock represented thereby.

	(k)

	No
	Issuance of Fractional Shares

	. No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued
	upon the conversion of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Instead of any fractional shares of Common Stock which
	would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall round up to the next
	whole share of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The determination
	as to whether any fractional shares of Common Stock shall be rounded up shall be made with respect to the aggregate number of
	shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock being converted at any one time by any holder thereof, not with respect to each
	share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock being converted.




	 




	(l)

	Partial
	Conversion

	. In the event some but not all of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock represented by a certificate(s)
	surrendered by a holder are converted, the Corporation shall execute and deliver to or on the order of the holder, at the expense
	of the Corporation, a new certificate representing the number of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock which were not
	converted.




	 




	(m)

	Reservation
	of Common Stock

	. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of
	Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, such
	number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
	of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (including any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock represented by any warrants,
	options, subscription or purchase rights for Series B Convertible Preferred Stock), and if at any time the number of authorized
	but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock (including any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock represented by any warrants, options,
	subscriptions or purchase rights for such Preferred Stock), the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to increase
	its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.




	 




	(n)

	No
	Reissuance of Preferred Stock

	. No share or shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason
	of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued as a share or shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock,
	however, all such shares shall be made available as preferred shares which the Corporation shall be authorized to issue. The Corporation
	shall from time to time take such appropriate corporate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of
	the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.

	Redemption.




	 




	(a)

	Redemption
	of Preferred Stock.

	Subject to the provisions of Section 5, and any actions previously taken pursuant thereto, on the second
	anniversary of the termination of the offering whereby the Corporation offered and sold Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the
	“Redemption Date”), the Corporation shall redeem all then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (“Series
	B Redemption”) for a price per Share equal to the Liquidation Value for such Share, plus all unpaid accrued and accumulated
	dividends on such Share (whether or not declared) (the “Series B Redemption Price,” for all holders collectively,
	the “Aggregate Series B Redemption Price”). The Aggregate Series B Redemption Price shall be payable in immediately
	available funds to the respective holders of the Series B Preferred Stock within sixty (60) days following the Redemption Date
	and the Corporation shall contribute all of its assets to the payment of the Aggregate Series B Redemption Price, and to no other
	corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Delaware law.





	 





	(b)

	Insufficient
	Funds; Remedies for Nonpayment

	.




	 




	(i)

	Insufficient Funds

	. If the assets of the Corporation legally available are insufficient to pay the Aggregate Series B Redemption
	Price, the Corporation shall (i) take all appropriate action reasonably within its means to maximize the assets legally available
	for paying the Aggregate Series B Redemption Price, (ii) redeem out of all such assets legally available therefor the maximum
	possible number of Shares that it can redeem on such date, pro rata among the holders of such Shares, and (iii) thereafter at
	any time and from time to time when additional assets of the Corporation become legally available to redeem the remaining Shares,
	the Corporation shall immediately use such assets to pay the remaining balance of the Aggregate Series B Redemption Price.




	 




	(ii)

	Remedies for Nonpayment

	. If within sixty (60) days of the Redemption Date all shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are
	not redeemed in full, until such Shares are fully redeemed and the Aggregate Series B Redemption Price paid in full, (a) all of
	the unredeemed Shares shall remain outstanding and continue to have the rights, preferences and privileges expressed herein, including
	the accrual and accumulation of dividends thereon as provided in Section 4, and (b) interest on the portion of the aggregate Series
	B Redemption Price applicable to the unredeemed Shares shall accrue daily in arrears at an annual rate equal to 10%.




	 




	(c)

	Rights
	Subsequent to Redemption

	. At such time that the Series B Redemption Price is paid (or payment is tendered) for any of the
	Shares to be redeemed, on such date all rights of the holder in the Shares so redeemed and paid or tendered, including any rights
	to dividends on such Shares, shall cease, and such Shares shall no longer be deemed issued and outstanding.

	7.


	Registration
	of Transfer.

	The Corporation will keep at its principal office a register for the registration
	of shares of Preferred Stock. Upon the surrender of any certificate representing shares of Preferred Stock at such place, the
	Corporation will, at the request of the record holders of such certificate, execute and deliver (at the Corporation’s expense)
	a new certificate or certificates in exchange therefore representing the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock represented
	by the surrendered certificate. Each such new certificate will be registered in such name and will represent such number of shares
	of Preferred Stock as is required by the holder of the surrendered certificate and will be substantially identical in form to
	the surrendered certificate.





	 




	8.


	Replacement.

	Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation (an affidavit of the registered
	holder will be satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificate evidencing shares
	of Preferred Stock, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an unsecured indemnity from the holder
	reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation or, in the case of such mutilation upon surrender of such certificate, the Corporation
	will (at its expense) execute and deliver in lieu of such certificate a new certificate of like kind representing the number of
	shares of Preferred Stock represented by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate and dated the date of such lost,
	stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate.





	 




	9.


	Restrictions
	and Limitations on Corporate Action and Amendments to Charter.

	The Corporation shall not take
	any corporate action or otherwise amend its Certificate of Incorporation without the approval by vote or written consent of the
	holders of at least 50.01% of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class except and to
	the extent that any series of Preferred Stock would be treated differently from other series of Preferred Stock, in which case
	such series shall be entitled to a separate series vote, each share of Preferred Stock to be entitled to that number of votes
	equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share could then be converted pursuant to the provisions of

	Section
	5

	, if such corporate action or amendment would:





	 




	(a) amend
	any of the rights, preferences, privileges of or limitations provided for herein for the benefit of any shares of Series B Convertible
	Preferred Stock;




	 




	(b) authorize
	or issue, or obligate the Corporation to authorize or issue, (i) additional shares (beyond the amount authorized herein) of Series
	B Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) Series B Parity Stock (as defined in

	Section 3(b)

	) or (iii) shares of Preferred Stock
	senior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to liquidation preferences, dividend rights or redemption rights;




	 




	(c) decrease
	the authorized number of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock;




	 




	(d) cause
	the Corporation to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for value (or pay into or set aside for a sinking fund for such purpose),
	any securities of the Corporation, pursuant to a redemption, purchase or other acquisition for cash of shares of Preferred Stock,
	which is effected pro rata with the holders thereof, in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which such holders
	are entitled; or

	(e) amend
	any provisions of this

	Section 9

	10.


	No
	Dilution or Impairment.

	The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation
	or through any reorganization, transfer of capital stock or assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities
	or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the Preferred Stock
	set forth herein, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such
	action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against dilution
	or other impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation (a) will not increase the par value of
	any shares of stock receivable on the conversion of the Preferred Stock above the amount payable therefor on such conversion,
	and (b) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue
	fully paid and nonassessable shares of stock on the conversion of all Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding.





	 




	11.


	Notices
	of Record Date.

	In the event of:





	 




	(a) any
	taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
	who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any
	shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right; or




	 




	(b) any

	(i) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right and a description
	of such dividend, distribution or right, (ii) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, transfer,
	consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (iii) the time, if any, that
	is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares
	of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification,
	recapitalization, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Such notice shall be mailed by first
	class mail, postage prepaid, at least ten (10) days prior to the earlier of (A) the date specified in such notice on which such

	LETTER
	FROM THE FOUNDER




	 




	March
	1, 2017




	 




	With
	the support of our shareholders, Algodon Group (OTCQB: VINO) has created an emerging luxury brand featuring a number of exciting
	projects under the Algodon® umbrella. Have you visited the vineyards and winery of Algodon Wine Estates in the heart of Argentina’s
	wine country in San Rafael, Mendoza? Our property there includes 325 acres (131 hectares) of vines dating back to 1946, as well
	as a 2,050 acre (830 hectare) luxury real estate development with over 400 estate lots (ranging from .5 to 7 acres). That bucolic
	spot features the Algodon Wines & Wellness Resort, a developing premier wine, wellness, culinary, and sport resort that includes
	golf and tennis facilities. Have you tasted (or bought) some of our Algodon Fine Wines, several of which have received numerous
	international accolades? Have you tried Algodon’s award-winning olive oil sourced directly from the estate? Have you been
	able to spend a few nights at the beautiful Algodon Mansion, our all-suite boutique hotel located in the fashionable heart of
	Buenos Aires’ luxury residential and embassy district?




	 




	Clearly,
	Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. is growing up, but we know we have a long way to go. And we think we are in
	a good place to do so.




	 




	Along
	with much of the investment community, we believe Argentina is finally emerging from its long economic slump and is already on
	a path toward significant growth. The election in 2016 of Argentina’s new president, Mauricio Macri, seemed to presage a
	new economic era in Argentina, and caused many to take a fresh, new look at all that Argentina has to offer. From the earliest
	days of his presidency, the global financial press has widely reported an abundance of positive news regarding Argentina’s
	economic forecast and investment potential, highlighting Argentina as one of the best places to invest in 2016 and beyond. We
	at Algodon have been focusing on Argentina for about ten years, and it’s clear that we are no longer alone in our thinking.
	In January 2017, for example, Morgan Stanley forecast that Argentina’s stock market could “rocket” (their word,
	not mine) as much as 258% in five years.




	 




	The
	challenge we now face is this: while we have acquired and developed significant real estate assets and are starting to see the
	fruits of our hard work, we have begun to think and plan bigger than we have in the past. We are very happy with our substantial
	real estate holdings as last year was a huge positive for real estate values in Argentina. We are also pleased that our wines
	are just now beginning to sell in the U.S., and so on. But as a public company, we are now thinking bigger, with a focus on further
	expanding our customer base as we seek to become the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) of South America. With our new perspective,
	we now find ourselves with the ability to “scale” on a significant and global basis as it relates to significant long
	term business expansion, revenues and ultimately our market capitalization. So as a public company, we now have two important
	and specific goals. First, we want to elevate our company’s shares from the OTC marketplace and successfully uplist to a
	national exchange such as the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ, in order to help unlock the value we have achieved to date and to develop
	greater liquidity for our shareholders. Our second goal is to demonstrate to the investment community how we will leverage our
	brand in order to achieve significant economic scale far beyond our earlier thinking. We have been hard at work focused on these
	goals. The opportunity now exists, and we must position ourselves to take full advantage of the timing.

	We
	believe Buenos Aires is in the very early stages of igniting a renewed emphasis on its moniker “the Paris of South America.”
	Argentina was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and Buenos Aires enjoyed a reputation as one of the globe’s
	most elegant hotspots. Before Peronism, Buenos Aires had a place among the top fashion capitals of the world, alongside Paris,
	Milan, London, Tokyo, and New York. But Argentina’s capital city lost its foothold on that list many years ago due to bad
	politics, protectionist trade measures, and limits on imports and exports. Last year, President Macri’s administration reversed
	many of these business-unfriendly policies, and now trade is coming back, tourism levels are at an all-time high and growing,
	and significant import and export restrictions have been lifted. We believe there is now substantial opportunity in Argentina’s
	luxury goods market, and that there will be a renewed global interest in Argentinian luxury goods, specifically those from Buenos
	Aires.




	 




	As
	discussed below, if we are to achieve scale, our thinking is to shift well beyond our branded wines and hospitality sectors. And
	to do that, we have launched two new initiatives: the creation of “Algodon – Buenos Aires” branded products
	and providing access to other luxury Argentinian products via a new global e-commerce platform. We believe the potential for economic
	scale which these initiatives present can be significant.




	 




	We
	have identified and begun working on a number of programs and initiatives which we believe will lead to better financial results
	derived from increased revenues while also leveraging our brand to achieve a new level of scale.




	 





	Here
	is where it gets exciting:






	 







	 




	1.




	U.S.
	wine sales: Algodon Fine Wines will soon be available for sale online at Sherry-Lehmann.com (which ships to 39 states), and
	at Sherry-Lehmann’s iconic retail store in New York City. To help get the word out in the NY metro area, Time Warner
	Cable (“Spectrum”) Television’s local program “A Taste of New York” featured a 5 minute segment
	featuring Algodon Fine Wines, which was aired weekly for four weeks (a total of 20 minutes of air time). A Taste of New York
	has a potential local audience of 3.5 million weekly. Sherry-Lehmann also recently announced that they will soon enter the
	California market with a retail store slated to open in early 2017 in the greater Los Angeles area, where we hope to also
	be represented. Our importer’s goal is to have our wines in the major wine-drinking markets in the U.S. including CA,
	TX, IL and others. The potential for scale here is significant.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	2.




	Algodon
	Group will leverage Sotheby’s International Realty brand and network with more than 18,000 sales associates located
	in 825 offices in 61 countries and territories worldwide, while utilizing the local expertise of Sotheby’s International
	Realty recent local partnership to form Ginevra Sotheby’s International Realty, a leading luxury real estate firm in
	Buenos Aires and the rest of the country. Through Ginevra Sotheby’s International Realty’s website (ginevrasir.com),
	Algodon Wine Estates listings will be marketed on sothebysrealty.com to a global clientele.

	3.




	Algodon
	Group’s internal sales team is creating a hardline marketing campaign focusing on Google Ads to generate additional
	real estate interest and leads.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	4.




	We
	anticipate that we will soon be authorized to issue deeds for lots already sold (several of which have homes built on them
	already) at Algodon Wine Estates. This will finally enable us to recognize the income from these sales on our financial statements,
	as well as from future sales on these deeded lots.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	5.




	We
	own Algodon Wine Estates outright – no leverage, so potential buyers can turn to us for any needed financing, rather
	than from a bank or a mortgage company. By offering “owner financing” options, we have created a new “interest
	income” revenue stream which can become substantial over time, and also makes purchasing at Algodon Wine Estates easier
	and a more attractive opportunity for potential buyers.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	6.




	As
	the number of sold lots at Algodon Wine Estates increases, the amount of monthly maintenance fees that we receive continues
	to grow, and these revenues help offset the expenses we incur in continuing to build out the infrastructure of this large
	property.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	7.




	If
	the Company is successful in an uplisting to NASDAQ or the NYSE MKT, we believe we will be positioned to utilize the Company’s
	stock as “currency” in a sort of “roll-up strategy” to acquire other companies that fall squarely
	within or complement the Company’s existing and planned lines of business. For example, we might seek to acquire businesses
	that offer luxury products and experiential hospitality experiences the quality of which is consistent with the Algodon brand.






	 





	Here
	is where it gets more exciting:





	 






	 




	8.




	Leveraging
	the Algodon brand, and building on the renewed global interest in all kinds of products from Argentina, we are now developing
	a new luxury product category to include perfumes and colognes to be marketed as luxury items from Buenos Aires. Our first
	product will be a perfume called

	Oro Blanco

	(“

	White Gold

	”) by Algodon - Buenos Aires, and more products
	are in development. We see the potential for scale here as Buenos Aires reasserts its position as the “Paris of South
	America” and as one of the fashion capital cities of the world, as it was in Argentina’s glory days.







	 






	Here
	is a potential game-changer:





	 






	 




	9.




	We
	have begun developing a U.S.-based e-commerce portal and flash sale website, dubbed “Project ARLUX,” which will
	offer the very best of Argentina: high end products and brands that reflect the quality and craftsmanship of a bygone era
	but which still flourishes in Argentina. From leather goods such as shoes, boots, jackets and wallets, to cutlery, to high-end
	fashion, jewelry and other accessories and precious metal goods, to fragrances, to wine & spirits, the opportunity we
	see is broad and deep. We believe the potential for scale here is particularly significant as Argentina is poised to make
	a noteworthy re-entry to international trade. Currently, one of the few ways to buy Argentina goods is to travel there and
	buy local. We want to change that, and in a favorable economic and political climate, we seek to be in the forefront of opening
	Argentina’s luxury market to the millions of potential customers around the globe interested in luxury items and experiences
	from Argentina. And of course, Algodon’s branded products – the wine resort, the boutique hotel, the premium wines,
	and more, will be well represented on this e-commerce platform.

	As
	we focus our business efforts on these undertakings, we also seek to uplist our stock to a national exchange, and to do that we
	seek to boost our shareholder equity, which is one of the important criteria for uplisting. In combination, we hope we will be
	positioned to achieve our primary current goals, trade on a national exchange and dramatically scale our product offerings as
	we grow our customer base and increase our revenues.




	 




	We
	would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, which has enabled Algodon to become an emerging brand known
	for luxury and prestige. From our premium wines, luxury accommodations and real estate development projects, we believe Algodon
	has earned its place as a reputable and emerging member of the global luxury community. We are more enthusiastic than ever, and
	though still a small company, our reputation is growing, and we believe there are significant opportunities ahead.




	 




	Thank
	you,

	L. Mathis

	and CEO

Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group Commences United States Rollout of Fine Malbec Wines with Seaview ImportsLeading Importer of Fine Wines to Bring Argentine Success to U.S. National Stage
Source: Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group09.12.2016NEW YORK, NY - September 12, 2016 - Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. (OTCQB: VINO), a real estate development brand with luxury lifestyle assets and premium wines in Argentina, has appointed Seaview Imports as its sole U.S. agent and importer of Algodon's complete portfolio of fine wines produced in the San Rafael, Mendoza wine region of Argentina.
Featured wines coming to the United States include Algodon's classic range of single varietal wines such as Malbec, Bonarda and Chardonnay, as well as Algodon's mid-range wines Malbec-Bonarda and Malbec Reserve. Seaview Imports will also showcase Algodon's award-winning vintage, PIMA available in limited production. PIMA is handcrafted from some of Algodon's oldest vineyards, planted in 1946 and represents the best of Algodon's winemaking potential, blended with a careful selection of Malbec, Bonarda, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Merlot grapes.
Algodon Fine Wines, founded in 2007, is one of the most exciting and dynamic wine brands emerging from Argentina. Located in San Rafael, Mendoza, in the beautiful foothills of the Sierra Pintadas, Algodon produces a full range of premium wines from land holdings that include noted parcels of pre-phylloxera vineyards dating back to the 1940s. The Mendoza winery in the southernmost region of Argentina's wine capital is fed by the purest meltwater from the glacial Andes. Over 325 acres of vines go back as far as 1946 and produce exceptional fruit on sandy and clay loam.
Algodon Fine Wines are handcrafted by the brilliant winemaker, Mauro Nosenzo, who is aided by acclaimed oenologist Marcello Pelleriti and advised by Master of Wine, Anthony Foster. Algodon's goal is to produce premium wines utilizing ecofriendly, organic inspired approaches, combined with the best modern winemaking technology. Brought together by CEO Scott Mathis and his partners, Algodon Wine Estates' renowned winemakers bring decades of experience, as well as craftsmanship and tradition that have been passed down for generations.
Algodon's premium wines have received a number of top awards and ratings from the world's foremost tasting competitions. The company's complete portfolio of fine wines is currently available in distinguished wine bars, wine shops, restaurants and hotels in Buenos Aires and Mendoza (including over 210 sales points throughout Argentina). Algodon Fine Wines are also distributed in Germany, Switzerland, Guernsey, U.K., and the Netherlands.
"Algodon Fine Wines is already a dominant player in the Argentine wine market and their global expansion into the U.K. and European markets caught our attention in 2014," said James Galtieri, Seaview's president and CEO. "Since then, Algodon has received numerous industry accolades and awards and it was a natural fit for Seaview to bring the international momentum into the U.S. markets. The premium quality and ecofriendly approach to winemaking complement our portfolio of premium wines and our close working relationship with the Algodon Group is an asset that will allow a long, fruitful and successful relationship for the future."
Founder, Chairman and CEO Scott Mathis added: "We are proud to be represented by Seaview Imports and look forward to showcasing Algodon Fine Wines in the U.S. market. Seaview's global expertise in the premium wine distribution category will allow our team to focus on making superb malbec varietals while seamlessly expanding our footprint in the United States. We are now in the most important wine market in the world and U.S. wine enthusiasts will have the opportunity to purchase some of the best Malbecs produced in Argentina."
About Seaview Imports
Founded in 2013, Seaview Imports is a national importer of fine wines from France, Spain, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Chile. Headquartered in Port Washington, NY, the company distributes its products in twenty-five select states through wholesalers and state boards.  Their producers are leaders in their regions and their portfolios are all exceptional in quality and value.   For further information, please visit www.seaviewimports.com.
About Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group (Algodon Group)
In building our luxury brand ALGODON®, one of prestige, distinction and elegance, we begin with a focus on the quality and reputation of our award-wining wines.  Algodon Wines ultimately serve as our ambassador, as we then identify and develop vineyard operations, luxury lifestyle properties, and other real estate assets and opportunities.  Our company has a passion for seeking outstanding opportunities, with the potential for growth, in spectacular settings.  As we continue to produce the ultra-fine wines for which we have become recognized, we expect that our reputation for quality will only continue to grow and accordingly increase the value of our company's brand and real estate holdings.  Algodon's non-leveraged, luxury assets serve as our mainstay and are currently concentrated in Argentina, which we believe represents one of the most undervalued investment sectors in the world today.

About Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group
Diversified Collection of Luxury Assets Anchored by Non-Leveraged Argentina Real Estate Holdings.Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. (Algodon Group) is a U.S. based public company that owns and develops luxury real estate assets in Argentina.  We are among the first real estate developers in Argentina to report on a U.S. stock market (OTCQB: VINO), and our non-leveraged assets provide one of the few public vehicles to participate in the anticipated growth in value of Argentina real estate. Algodon Group is the only publicly traded luxury development brand with unleveraged real estate, premium wines, and luxury lifestyle assets currently focused on Argentina.Algodon seeks to become the LVMH of South America with our initial collection of assets beginning in Argentina, due to its value proposition and current opportunities.  Algodon is an emerging luxury brand, currently consisting of a collection of offerings that includes Algodon Fine Wines, Algodon Wine Estates, Algodon Wine & Wellness Resort, Algodon Mansion, and Algodon Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Our mission is to utilize the value inherent in our non-leveraged luxury assets and real estate as a base to roll up and acquire additional assets directly related to the future growth of our brand. Algodon's winemakers work diligently towards the goal of our brand becoming synonymous with the best Malbec and Malbec blends in the world, which we believe may significantly advance the value of the Algodon luxury brand; one of quality, elegance and attention to detail.  With our fines wines as our ambassador, we identify and develop unique lifestyle properties, vineyard operations and other real estate assets, as well as luxury brands in Argentina, and may potentially expand in the future to other vital areas of South America and around the globe. We are opportunistic investors with an entrepreneurial spirit and a contrarian investment philosophy.Our current luxury portfolio includes the vineyards and winery of Algodon Wine Estates in San Rafael, Mendoza, which has received international accolades for Algodon Fine Wines, and which includes 325 acres (131 hectares) of vines dating back to 1946, as well as a 2,050 acre (830 hectare) luxury real estate development with over 400 estate lots (ranging from .5 to 7 acres), and Algodon Wines & Wellness Resort, a developing premier wine, wellness, culinary, and sport resort that includes golf and tennis facilities, an all-suite boutique hotel in Buenos Aires, called Algodon Mansion, located in the heart of the city’s luxury residential and embassy district, and Algodon Olive Oil, the estate grown and award-winning extra virgin olive oil that has been expertly blended to complement our wines.Investing in Argentina before the crowd since 2007, Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. is headquartered in New York City, with offices in Buenos Aires and Mendoza.Why Invest in Argentina?
