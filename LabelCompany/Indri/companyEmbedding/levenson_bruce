ATLANTA, Feb. 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Launched first with seed money from Karen and Bruce Levenson three years ago and then a follow on major gift from the Levensons, The Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership at the University of Maryland has quickly grown into the leading center for philanthropic studies in the Nation's Capital.
Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150218/176368 
The Center features a host of innovative courses and programs including several classes each semester that each culminate in $10,000 gifts to worthy non-profit organizations. This school year marked the first where a "living and learning" dorm was created for sixty incoming freshmen taking courses at the Center. And a just completed abroad program sponsored by the Center sent 12 graduate students to India to work for three NGOs focused on the disabled, wildlife preservation and youth outreach. 
This semester, thousands of University of Maryland students will participate in the Do Good Challenge funded, organized and run by the Center. Now in its fourth year, the Challenge is an innovative campus wide competition that inspires students to make the greatest social impact they can for their favorite cause. Winners receive $20,000 in prize money to advance their causes. 
"The mission of the Center is two fold," according to Bruce Levenson. "We are giving students in the program the skills and experiences they need to be the next generation of leaders in the non-profit sector. And, at the same time, we are using the Center in a multi-pronged effort to ensure that every student attending the University of Maryland graduates as an informed and motivated philanthropist." "It is leveraged philanthropy at its best," adds Karen Levenson, a University of Maryland alum.
Students in the program are frequently sought after by nonprofits in the D.C. area to participate as fellows for organizations such as the Marriott Foundation and the Smithsonian. Upon graduation, many of the students find full-time employment at the nonprofits where they have worked as fellows. And some have started their own non-profits launched through support from the Center. The University of Maryland is providing innovative ways to teach and encourage its students to give back to the community. 
The Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership is an exciting new approach to higher education that is helping both local and international communities. "The students will be able to put the skills and experiences they gain from the Center to work to impact lives locally, nationally and around throughout the world," said Bruce Levenson. "Of all the worthy causes we have been involved in, the Center has the potential to have far and away the most profound impact," Karen Levenson added.

Early life and education[edit]
Bruce Levenson was born to a Jewish family[6] in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[7] He later attended college at Washington University in St. Louis and graduated from law school at American University.[8] While attending law school at night, Levenson began his journalism career at the Washington Star.[9]
Career[edit]
UCG[edit]
Levenson co-founded United Communications Group (UCG) with Ed Peskowitz in 1977. Based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Levenson and Peskowitz started the company in Levenson's apartment, publishing a newsletter, Oil Express, focusing on developments in the oil industry.[10] UCG acquired other newsletters and launched databases including Oil Price Information Service (OPIS). UCG is a privately held business information company that specializes in data, news and analysis for healthcare, energy, mortgage banking, technology, telecommunications and other industries.[10] UCG also owns and operates GasBuddy, a mobile application that assists drivers in finding local low gas prices.[11]
Atlanta Hawks[edit]
In 2004, Atlanta Spirit LLC, now known as Atlanta Hawks LLC, was formed to buy the Atlanta Hawks from Turner Broadcasting.[10][12] Levenson and Ed Peskowitz are majority partners of Atlanta Hawks LLC, a group of businessmen who collectively own the Atlanta Hawks professional basketball team and Philips Arena.[13] The purchase originally included the Atlanta Thrashers as well, but the group sold the NHL team in 2011.[3][14] Levenson is the team's managing partner and as a member of the NBA Board of Governors.[2]
In 2012, Levenson hired Danny Ferry as the Hawks general manager and president of basketball operations.[15] Previously, Ferry played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and later served as the general manager for the Cavaliers and was the vice president of operations for the San Antonio Spurs before going to the Hawks.[16]
In March 2014, Levenson and his wife accompanied the Hawks basketball team and staff to the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.[17][18] Levenson's mother-in-law Irene Boyarsky, a Holocaust survivor, also attended the trip with the team. Levenson spoke with the team about her experiences before and during the tour.[17][19]
Later in 2014, Levenson announced his plans to sell his share of the ownership group after self-reporting an email sent in August 2012 discussing the Hawks African-American fan base.[20][21][22][23] Levenson is coordinating the sale of the team through the help of an investment banking firm.[24]
Other activities[edit]
Levenson is a founding board member and on the Board of Directors of TechTarget.[5][9] The company spun out of development under UCG and Levenson served as a director of the company from its founding in 1999 until 2012.[25]
Levenson was an adviser for BIA Digital Partners, a private equity firm.[25][26] He has also was on the Board of Directors of the Newsletter and Electronic Publishers Association (NEPA), and was inducted into the Software and Information Industry Association's Hall of Fame in 1997 with Ed Peskowitz for their work with UCG.[27]
Philanthropy[edit]
Levenson has also been an active participant in various philanthropic organizations such as Community Foundation of Washington, D.C. and the Hoop Dreams Foundation.[28][29] Previously, he served as president of the Washington chapter of I Have a Dream Foundation, an organization helping low-income children pursue higher education.[8]
Levenson is a founding donor to the U.S. Holocaust Museum and funds the Museum's Bringing the Lessons Home program, which teaches inner city students the lessons of the Holocaust and trains them to be tour guides at the Museum.[19][30] His mother-in-law is a survivor of The Holocaust.[31] He has also made significant donations to the SEED Foundation[32][33] and Seeds of Peace.[34] Levenson supports various other Jewish causes including Birthright Israel, the Jewish Federation, the Jewish Youth Philanthropy Institute, and BBYO, a Jewish-American youth movement.[6]
In 2010, Levenson and his wife spearheaded the development of the Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership at the University of Maryland[35] and provided seed funding to the institution that educates students on how to run nonprofit organizations and engages the university to inform and motivate philanthropic activities.[36]
In April 2013, Levenson was one of 100 prominent American Jews who sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him to "work closely" with Secretary of State John Kerry "to devise pragmatic initiatives, consistent with Israel's security needs, which would represent Israel's readiness to make painful territorial sacrifices for the sake of peace."[6]
In 2015, Levenson and his wife Karen were chairs of the John F. Kennedy Center's Concert Against Hate in Washington, D.C.. The concert, benefiting the Anti-Defamation League, pays tribute to individuals who have stood up to hatred and bigotry.[37][38]
Personal life[edit]
Levenson and his wife Karen (née Boyarsky)[31] have homes in Atlanta and Potomac, Maryland. They have three sons.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Bruce Levenson was born to a Jewish family[6] in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[7] He later attended college at Washington University in St. Louis and graduated from law school at American University.[8] While attending law school at night, Levenson began his journalism career at the Washington Star.[9]
Career[edit]
UCG[edit]
Levenson co-founded United Communications Group (UCG) with Ed Peskowitz in 1977. Based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Levenson and Peskowitz started the company in Levenson's apartment, publishing a newsletter, Oil Express, focusing on developments in the oil industry.[10] UCG acquired other newsletters and launched databases including Oil Price Information Service (OPIS). UCG is a privately held business information company that specializes in data, news and analysis for healthcare, energy, mortgage banking, technology, telecommunications and other industries.[10] UCG also owns and operates GasBuddy, a mobile application that assists drivers in finding local low gas prices.[11]
Atlanta Hawks[edit]
In 2004, Atlanta Spirit LLC, now known as Atlanta Hawks LLC, was formed to buy the Atlanta Hawks from Turner Broadcasting.[10][12] Levenson and Ed Peskowitz are majority partners of Atlanta Hawks LLC, a group of businessmen who collectively own the Atlanta Hawks professional basketball team and Philips Arena.[13] The purchase originally included the Atlanta Thrashers as well, but the group sold the NHL team in 2011.[3][14] Levenson is the team's managing partner and as a member of the NBA Board of Governors.[2]
In 2012, Levenson hired Danny Ferry as the Hawks general manager and president of basketball operations.[15] Previously, Ferry played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and later served as the general manager for the Cavaliers and was the vice president of operations for the San Antonio Spurs before going to the Hawks.[16]
In March 2014, Levenson and his wife accompanied the Hawks basketball team and staff to the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.[17][18] Levenson's mother-in-law Irene Boyarsky, a Holocaust survivor, also attended the trip with the team. Levenson spoke with the team about her experiences before and during the tour.[17][19]
Later in 2014, Levenson announced his plans to sell his share of the ownership group after self-reporting an email sent in August 2012 discussing the Hawks African-American fan base.[20][21][22][23] Levenson is coordinating the sale of the team through the help of an investment banking firm.[24]
Other activities[edit]
Levenson is a founding board member and on the Board of Directors of TechTarget.[5][9] The company spun out of development under UCG and Levenson served as a director of the company from its founding in 1999 until 2012.[25]
Levenson was an adviser for BIA Digital Partners, a private equity firm.[25][26] He has also was on the Board of Directors of the Newsletter and Electronic Publishers Association (NEPA), and was inducted into the Software and Information Industry Association's Hall of Fame in 1997 with Ed Peskowitz for their work with UCG.[27]
Philanthropy[edit]
Levenson has also been an active participant in various philanthropic organizations such as Community Foundation of Washington, D.C. and the Hoop Dreams Foundation.[28][29] Previously, he served as president of the Washington chapter of I Have a Dream Foundation, an organization helping low-income children pursue higher education.[8]
Levenson is a founding donor to the U.S. Holocaust Museum and funds the Museum's Bringing the Lessons Home program, which teaches inner city students the lessons of the Holocaust and trains them to be tour guides at the Museum.[19][30] His mother-in-law is a survivor of The Holocaust.[31] He has also made significant donations to the SEED Foundation[32][33] and Seeds of Peace.[34] Levenson supports various other Jewish causes including Birthright Israel, the Jewish Federation, the Jewish Youth Philanthropy Institute, and BBYO, a Jewish-American youth movement.[6]
In 2010, Levenson and his wife spearheaded the development of the Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership at the University of Maryland[35] and provided seed funding to the institution that educates students on how to run nonprofit organizations and engages the university to inform and motivate philanthropic activities.[36]
In April 2013, Levenson was one of 100 prominent American Jews who sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him to "work closely" with Secretary of State John Kerry "to devise pragmatic initiatives, consistent with Israel's security needs, which would represent Israel's readiness to make painful territorial sacrifices for the sake of peace."[6]
In 2015, Levenson and his wife Karen were chairs of the John F. Kennedy Center's Concert Against Hate in Washington, D.C.. The concert, benefiting the Anti-Defamation League, pays tribute to individuals who have stood up to hatred and bigotry.[37][38]
Personal life[edit]
Levenson and his wife Karen (née Boyarsky)[31] have homes in Atlanta and Potomac, Maryland. They have three sons.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Bruce Levenson was born to a Jewish family[6] in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[7] He later attended college at Washington University in St. Louis and graduated from law school at American University.[8] While attending law school at night, Levenson began his journalism career at the Washington Star.[9]
Career[edit]
UCG[edit]
Levenson co-founded United Communications Group (UCG) with Ed Peskowitz in 1977. Based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Levenson and Peskowitz started the company in Levenson's apartment, publishing a newsletter, Oil Express, focusing on developments in the oil industry.[10] UCG acquired other newsletters and launched databases including Oil Price Information Service (OPIS). UCG is a privately held business information company that specializes in data, news and analysis for healthcare, energy, mortgage banking, technology, telecommunications and other industries.[10] UCG also owns and operates GasBuddy, a mobile application that assists drivers in finding local low gas prices.[11]
Atlanta Hawks[edit]
In 2004, Atlanta Spirit LLC, now known as Atlanta Hawks LLC, was formed to buy the Atlanta Hawks from Turner Broadcasting.[10][12] Levenson and Ed Peskowitz are majority partners of Atlanta Hawks LLC, a group of businessmen who collectively own the Atlanta Hawks professional basketball team and Philips Arena.[13] The purchase originally included the Atlanta Thrashers as well, but the group sold the NHL team in 2011.[3][14] Levenson is the team's managing partner and as a member of the NBA Board of Governors.[2]
In 2012, Levenson hired Danny Ferry as the Hawks general manager and president of basketball operations.[15] Previously, Ferry played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and later served as the general manager for the Cavaliers and was the vice president of operations for the San Antonio Spurs before going to the Hawks.[16]
In March 2014, Levenson and his wife accompanied the Hawks basketball team and staff to the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.[17][18] Levenson's mother-in-law Irene Boyarsky, a Holocaust survivor, also attended the trip with the team. Levenson spoke with the team about her experiences before and during the tour.[17][19]
Later in 2014, Levenson announced his plans to sell his share of the ownership group after self-reporting an email sent in August 2012 discussing the Hawks African-American fan base.[20][21][22][23] Levenson is coordinating the sale of the team through the help of an investment banking firm.[24]
Other activities[edit]
Levenson is a founding board member and on the Board of Directors of TechTarget.[5][9] The company spun out of development under UCG and Levenson served as a director of the company from its founding in 1999 until 2012.[25]
Levenson was an adviser for BIA Digital Partners, a private equity firm.[25][26] He has also was on the Board of Directors of the Newsletter and Electronic Publishers Association (NEPA), and was inducted into the Software and Information Industry Association's Hall of Fame in 1997 with Ed Peskowitz for their work with UCG.[27]
Philanthropy[edit]
Levenson has also been an active participant in various philanthropic organizations such as Community Foundation of Washington, D.C. and the Hoop Dreams Foundation.[28][29] Previously, he served as president of the Washington chapter of I Have a Dream Foundation, an organization helping low-income children pursue higher education.[8]
Levenson is a founding donor to the U.S. Holocaust Museum and funds the Museum's Bringing the Lessons Home program, which teaches inner city students the lessons of the Holocaust and trains them to be tour guides at the Museum.[19][30] His mother-in-law is a survivor of The Holocaust.[31] He has also made significant donations to the SEED Foundation[32][33] and Seeds of Peace.[34] Levenson supports various other Jewish causes including Birthright Israel, the Jewish Federation, the Jewish Youth Philanthropy Institute, and BBYO, a Jewish-American youth movement.[6]
In 2010, Levenson and his wife spearheaded the development of the Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership at the University of Maryland[35] and provided seed funding to the institution that educates students on how to run nonprofit organizations and engages the university to inform and motivate philanthropic activities.[36]
In April 2013, Levenson was one of 100 prominent American Jews who sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him to "work closely" with Secretary of State John Kerry "to devise pragmatic initiatives, consistent with Israel's security needs, which would represent Israel's readiness to make painful territorial sacrifices for the sake of peace."[6]
In 2015, Levenson and his wife Karen were chairs of the John F. Kennedy Center's Concert Against Hate in Washington, D.C.. The concert, benefiting the Anti-Defamation League, pays tribute to individuals who have stood up to hatred and bigotry.[37][38]
Personal life[edit]
Levenson and his wife Karen (née Boyarsky)[31] have homes in Atlanta and Potomac, Maryland. They have three sons.[2]

Bruce LevensonPhilanthropist and Businessman
  learn more about Bruce


 











A journalist, entrepreneur and successful builder of several businesses, Bruce Levenson’s global endeavors span a wide range of interests from business intelligence to professional sports to cooking technology. He is perhaps best known in the business world as co-founder of United Communications Group, a company that provides guidance, analysis, data and solutions to customers in energy, government contracting, healthcare, information and software, banking, technology, telecom, and defense industries worldwide.
Levenson is a director of TechTarget, a publicly-traded company that serves as the online intersection of serious technology buyers, targeted technical content and technology providers worldwide. He is also a partner in GasBuddy, a mobile app downloaded by over 45 million motorists who use it to find low-priced gasoline. Additionally, he co-founded DOT, a new cooking technology that, among other things, toasts sliced bread in three seconds. He is an owner of Atlanta Hawks LLC, which owns the Atlanta Hawks NBA franchise. Most importantly, Bruce has been a philanthropist for over forty years.


 

















Philanthropy






Since the early 1980s, Bruce and wife Karen have funded numerous education initiatives targeting disadvantaged youth. Several of these initiatives, including PeacePlayers, “I Have a Dream,” the Seed School and the Bringing the Lessons Home program at the U.S. Holocaust Museum still exist and continue to do extraordinary work. But other well-intended efforts, often launched by passionate and committed leaders, have fallen by the wayside. Frequently they come to an end because they lack professional management.
With this in mind, four years ago the couple conceived and funded the Center for Philanthropy and Non-Profit Management at the University of Maryland. The Center has two goals:

Educate and empower the next generation of non-profit leaders, giving them the knowledge and tools they need to succeed as heads of no-profit organizations.
Insure that every student graduating from the University of Maryland graduates as an informed and motivated philanthropist. The Center provides students campus wide with unique, philanthropy-focused experiences ranging from informed gift-giving to the highly acclaimed Do Good Challenge which draws thousands of student participants every year.
The Center now provides undergraduate and graduate courses focused on philanthropy and non-profit management. The classes often feature prominent philanthropists and non-profit leaders as guest lectures. And several courses each semester include a component whereby non-profits submit grant requests. Each class gives away $10,000 to worthy non-profits based on a thorough assessment of proposals, site visits and, finally, a class vote. Since the program’s inception in 2011, these classes have award approximately $40,000 in grants each year.
In addition, students from the center are much in demand as fellows at non-profits in the Washington DC area ranging from the Smithsonian to the Marriott Foundation. The center also sends students overseas to India, Jordan and Israel where they put their skills to work in local NGOs.
Freshmen can also apply for the opportunity to live together in a special 60-students living/learning dorm where all the residents are focused on philanthropy and non-profit management.
The center continues to rapidly expand on Maryland’s campus. A philanthropist-in-resident program is in the works as is an initiative during freshmen orientation week to begin the process of informing and motivating all students to become philanthropists. And in 2016 the overseas program will expand to China.



















United Communications Group

When it comes to the business sector, Bruce Levenson is best known as co-founder of United Communications Group (UCG), a company he started in a storage room atop his father’s Washington, DC liquor store in 1977.
In 1978 UCG won its first journalism award for editorial excellence and has since won over 125 such awards, by far the most recognized business information company in America. In 1980, UCG was one of the first business information companies to deliver its information on-line, doing so over a decade before the commercial availability of the Internet. Headquartered just outside Washington, DC, UCG has been recognized as one of the Best Places to Work in the Washington metropolitan area.
Today, UCG has over 46 million customers worldwide, has offices in North America, Europe and Asia and employs over 1000 people.Levenson remains active in the company focusing and business development, acquisitions and strategic planning.


















Atlanta Hawks LLC

Bruce was able to live out a childhood dream in 2004 when he became an owner of two major professional sports franchises, purchasing the Atlanta Thrashers, Atlanta Hawks and the operating rights to the Philips Arena from Time Warner.
In 2010, Levenson and his partners sold the Atlanta Thrashers and the team was relocated to Winnipeg, Canada.
Levenson is a member of the NBA Board of Governors and chairs the Board of Managers that operates the Hawks. Under his leadership, the Hawks are the only team in the Eastern Conference of the NBA to reach the NBA playoffs for the past seven consecutive seasons and throughout the 2014-15 season the Hawks have had one of the best records in the NBA. Three Hawks are on the 2015 All-star team and the Hawks head coach was named head coach of the Eastern Conference all-stars. In 2012 Levenson hired Danny Ferry to head the Hawks basketball operations and in 2014 announced his intention to sell the team.

Levenson and the Hawks' real problem



By Mo Ivory
updated 8:33 AM EDT, Tue September 9, 2014
















STORY HIGHLIGHTS


Atlanta Hawks co-owner to sell his interest in team after racially charged email
Mo Ivory: The email wasn't shocking and team's problems have nothing to do with race
She says the failure to put a winning team on the court is the real problem
Ivory: Levenson could reap a financial reward in this sale




Editor's note: Mo Ivory is an attorney and radio personality who lives in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. Follow her on Twitter: @moivory The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
(CNN) -- Atlanta Hawks majority owner Bruce Levenson just figured out how to get rid of a product that no one wants to purchase by throwing himself on the confessional table of bigotry -- which will probably make him more wealthy than he could have ever imagined.
Sure, the publicity isn't flattering, and Levenson's hand may have been forced by the Hawks' internal investigation.
But this is not about racism, this is about business.
What we know
I've lived in Atlanta for close to 20 years -- the Hawks games are boring! I can't name the players. I don't know who they are married to or what they do in the community. They are not a fabric of my interest. I wish they had a star player whose jersey I wanted to buy so I could finally hang my Dominique Wilkins jersey up as memorabilia.
This is not about racism, this is about business.
So, like all other non-Atlanta natives living in Atlanta long term, when the Hawks play the New York Knicks, this native New Yorker whips out her Carmelo Anthony jersey and heads to Phillips Arena. The reason Bruce Levenson could not make the Hawks profitable is not because black people don't buy season tickets, or arrive at games late, or spend all their time at the bar, or black fathers don't bring black sons to the games. It's because the Hawks suck. They have no marquee players and they don't win games! (Yes, they've made the playoffs in the past seven years, but haven't gotten as far as the conference finals.)


Mo Ivory

This is not about racism, this is about business.
The few years that the Hawks have made it to the playoffs, you can hardly make it down Centennial Olympic Drive in time for tip-off because the traffic is so thick. Fans, white and black, show up when their hometown team is winning. Period.
This is not about racism, this is about business.
Opinion: Atlanta Hawks owner is a hypocrite
Are there unique factors to every city that accounts for distinctions between fan bases? Sure. New Orleans, Memphis, New York and Boston fans show up -- even when their teams are not having a winning season. Those cities are not as transient as Atlanta. That's something Bruce Levenson fails to realize is unique to Atlanta.
This is not about racism, this is about business.
Bruce Levenson's 2012 email, in which he shared his ideas about why his franchise was not as profitable as he hoped, as unscientific as it was, can hardly be called shocking or rise to the level of racially polarizing. It was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers, who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in America.
This is not about racism, this is about business.
I was slightly annoyed with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver commending Mr. Levenson for coming forward and self-reporting. Levenson revealed his email of August 2012 to Silver in July 2014, after the Hawks found it in an internal investigation and precisely the time that investigators for Donald Sterling were looking to expose other NBA owners for any possible racial missteps.
It's no coincidence that an NBA investigation on this Levenson matter was kept secret and remained pending until the Sterling deal became final. Why are we just now hearing about it? Silver knew, yet he didn't reveal it to the public.
Racism has never been as profitable in the NBA as it is right now in the wake of the historic $2 billion sale of the Clippers, the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league, and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals. Bruce Levenson is a businessman following the business model: Strike while the iron is hot. Buy low. Sell high.
This is not about racism, this is about business.

Yes, Bruce Levenson's Racist Email Was RacistYes, Bruce Levenson's Racist Email Was RacistAlbert Burneko9/09/14 5:05pmFiled to: bruce levensonatlanta hawksnbadonald sterlingracismcapitalismcapital it fails us now28070EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalink
	By now you're aware that Bruce Levenson, controlling owner of the Atlanta Hawks, is selling his stake in the team, at least in part because of fallout from 
	an email he sent to other members of team management back in 2012, theorizing that the team struggles to fill its arena because "the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base."
	In the email, Levenson attributes this to an in-arena experience overwhelmingly oriented toward black fans: hip-hop music playing over the PA system; black cheerleaders; a "too black" kiss-cam; hip-hop and gospel concerts after the games; ticket giveaways that (in Levenson's description) went primarily to black Atlantans.  He looks out at the stands and guesses "that our crowd is 40 [percent] black now, still four to five times all other teams. And my further guess is that 40 still feels like 70 to some whites at our games ... I think it is far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so low."Advertisement
	A lot of people, like 
	Jason Whitlock—theoretical proprietor of a nonexistent black Grantland—think this isn't racist. Their argument is that rather than animosity toward blacks, Levenson's email expresses a realist's recognition of white racism, combined with the mundane, rational desire of a business owner to broaden the demographic appeal of his product.  In the offending email, Levenson does his best to provide some cover for this interpretation, in the following passage:
Please dont get me wrong. There was nothing threatening going on in the arean back then. i never felt uncomfortable, but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority. On fan sites i would read comments about how dangerous it is around philips yet in our 9 years, i don't know of a mugging or even a pick pocket incident. This was just racist garbage. When I hear some people saying the arena is in the wrong place I think it is code for there are too many blacks at the games.

	One way to read this is as proof that Levenson is not 
	racist, but, rather, aware of and disgusted by racism.  He's calling out racists, as many observers have described it.AdvertisementAdvertisement
	The problem with this line of interpretation—one of the problems, anyway—is that this is all basically the 
	I'm not a racist in an I'm not a racist, but... riff. Levenson's proposed response to all this damnable bigotry, after all, is to make the in-arena experience 
	friendlier to racists.  No, really!  That's the very next part of his email:
I have been open with our executive team about these concerns. I have told them I want some white cheerleaders and while i don't care what the color of the artist is, i want the music to be music familiar to a 40 year old white guy if that's our season tixs demo. i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black. I have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black.

	"I am sick of seeing all these black people kissing each other" will probably not strike you as a particularly bold stance against racism.
	Dispense right away with the notion that this merely is 
	a business owner seeking to broaden the heretofore-narrow demographic appeal of his product.  In 2011-12, the average Hawks game drew 15,199 fans to the arena; Philips Arena has a capacity of 18,118 for basketball.  Recall Levenson's estimate of a 40 percent black crowd at games: Even if diversifying the cheerleading squad and rockin' some sweet Kenny Chesney tuneage on the PA filled all the remaining 2,919 seats with white people, that'd lower black attendance only to around 34 percent, nowhere near the magical 10 percent number he seems to think is the key to unlocking season ticket sales.  To get to that number, he'd actively have to drive away around 4,000 paying black customers, at which point, per his theorizing, he could fill the arena with grateful whites.
	Perhaps that's an ungenerous interpretation of Levenson's intent.  But consider that, by 
	Nate Silver's estimate, the Hawks' overall fan base is 48 percent black.  If Levenson's roughly correct in his eyeball guess that 40 percent of game attendees are black, then black fans are roughly proportionately represented at Hawks games, taking into account that black households have disproportionately low incomes, or perhaps even slightly under-represented.  No matter how you look at it, Levenson isn't just talking about cold demographics, and he certainly isn't talking about how his team's unique ability to draw black fans is an actual strength. He's talking about stiff-arming black fans to make more room for white ones.Advertisement
	Maybe this dude who managed to make enough money to buy a controlling interest in an NBA team is just bad at math, though.  Maybe he's just saying 
	white people are wealthier than black people, so more white fans = more season ticket sales.  And hey, that's probably just cold, unfortunate, but observable truth, right?  Bruce Levenson didn't personally create systemic injustice; he's just a realist with an arena to fill.Advertisement
	This line of reasoning is, though, an insidious artifact of our time: the notion that because someone—Bruce Levenson, say—is a mere inheritor of American society's racial stratification, this inoculates him against charges of racism when he figures out how to navigate that stratification profitably; the notion that capitulation to the reality of racism—an actual, real-life proposal to engineer an NBA product that presents as more friendly to white bigots—is mere economic rationality, as value-neutral as figuring out the most gas-efficient route to a destination.  
	Hey, take it up with George Washington, buddy: I'm just doin' what I gotta do.
	Leave aside, for a moment anyway, the fact that even a dimwitted 6-year-old knows better than to whip out this sort of "Hey, he started it!" bullshit.  Leave aside, also, the reality that, as a billionaire, Bruce Levenson could live in uninterrupted comfort and outrageous luxury for the rest of several lifetimes even if he decided he'd rather make no more money at all than profit off of calculated exploitation of racism. 
	This is the logic behind redlining; behind the NBA's dress code; behind Roger Goodell's self-fetishization as the Hammer of Sports Justice. Black people and black culture are repulsive to whites; whites are more valuable than blacks because black money chases off white money; therefore black people and black culture must be contained so as not to impede our access to whites.
	This is the logic of systemic racism, distinct from but no better than personal distaste for black people. This is a seemingly reasonable person endorsing the idea that a dollar from a black person is literally worth less than a dollar from a white one, because the dollar from a black person carries an invisible tax: It drives away white people, while a dollar from a white person draws in more of them.  In the hands of a business owner—translated into suggested changes to that business's product, into his complaints to his underlings about, say, the number of black cheerleaders that business employs—it ceases to be an idea. It is the enforcement of disparity, the literal devaluing of black dollars: "Your 
	actual ticket purchase is worth less to us than the hypothetical ticket sales we might get from racists by driving you away."Advertisement
	When a sports team owner says he wants some more white cheerleaders so the team can make some more money, do you think he's saying "Double the number of cheerleaders on our payroll for the sake of diversity," or "Replace some of these black cheerleaders with white ones"?  When he says that, do you think it matters all that much whether it's because he actively hates blacks or because he's cynically banking on other rich white people's hatred of blacks?  Do you think the replaced black cheerleaders will buy an argument that race isn't the reason the white team owner fired them?Advertisement
	This is white flight-as-marketing, different only by degree from the Atlanta Braves taking their business to suburban Cobb County in pursuit of white dollars.  It may be a shrewd market calculation.  It is also definitionally racist.  It poses the business offered by black people against the preferences of white bigots, and prioritizes the latter.  That capitalism will reward this choice by paying out for the business owner who makes it is not a defense of the choice; it is an indictment of capitalism.  The fact that, in this particular case, we are talking about attempts to render the product of a majority-black workforce more appealing to white bigots, so that the white management class will have more profits to skim for itself, only casts the whole thing in starker relief: Bruce Levenson is racist. So are his buddies. So is the system that enriches them.

Atlanta Hawks, LLC (formerly known as Atlanta Spirit LLC) was an Atlanta, Georgia-based parent company formerly the holder of the franchise of the Atlanta Hawks, a professional basketball team in the NBA, and the Atlanta Thrashers, a former professional hockey team in the NHL. The Atlanta Spirit LLC name was changed to Atlanta Hawks, LLC on March 14, 2014.
Atlanta Spirit LLC was originally composed of three companies: a Boston-based company (run by Steve Belkin), an Atlanta-based company (composed of J. Rutherford Seydel, Todd Foreman, J. Michael Gearon, Sr., Beau Turner and Bud Seretean)[1] and a Washington, D.C.-based company (composed of Bruce Levenson, Ed Peskowitz and Todd Foreman).[2] The Boston-based company was bought out by the Atlanta and Washington, D.C. groups in 2010 following conflicts between the three groups.[3]
Bud Seretean died in 2007. In 2014, Levenson announced he would sell his share of the company; however, by January 2015, every partner in the ownership group agreed to sell their stakes in the team, putting the entire franchise up for sale.[4]
History[edit]
In 2004, Atlanta Spirit LLC bought the Atlanta Thrashers, Atlanta Hawks, and operating rights to Philips Arena from Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System.
In the summer of 2005, the Atlanta Hawks finalized a trade with the Phoenix Suns to obtain shooting guard Joe Johnson for Boris Diaw and two protected future first-round picks. While this trade met with the approval of the majority of the ownership group, it was rejected by Belkin, who held a controlling vote as the Hawks Governor within the group. This triggered legal proceedings to force Belkin out of the group. On December 23, 2010, the group led by Gearon and Levenson announced they had bought out Belkin's ownership share in Atlanta Spirit LLC.[5] This elevated the Washington-based company shares to more than 50 percent and effective control of the group.[6]
In 2007, Spirit co-founder Bud Seretean died at the age of 83.[7]
On May 31, 2011, the Atlanta Spirit LLC sold the Thrashers to True North Sports and Entertainment, who relocated the team to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and re-branded them as the new Winnipeg Jets.
On September 7, 2014, the company's majority owner Bruce Levenson announced he would sell his interest in the company. Levenson explained the reason was a racially insensitive e-mail he sent to Hawks general manager Danny Ferry in 2012, saying that the team's low ticket sales were due to the Hawks attracting an African American fanbase that alienated the white suburbanites. He opted to share the e-mail with the NBA on July 2014, during the lawsuits that led the league to take the Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling, as the emergence of such a discrimination-related debacle made Levenson "remorseful for using those hurtful words".[8] On January 2, 2015, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that all partners in the ownership group would join Levenson and sell their minority stakes, effectively putting the entire franchise up for sale.[4] Goldman Sachs and Inner Circle Sports LLC handled the sale of the team, the operating rights to Philips Arena, and the remaining debt on the arena. Per NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, the Hawks are expected to remain in Atlanta as a condition of their sale.[9] On April 22, 2015 Atlanta Hawks, LLC reached a tentative agreement to sell the team and arena operating rights to a group led by Tony Ressler for $850 million. The sale of the team was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on June 24, 2015.[10]
Turner connection[edit]
Although Ted Turner is not a part of this group, there are many connections to him: Beau Turner is his youngest son, J. Rutherford Seydel is one of his children in-law,[11][12] Michael Gearon Sr. was the general manager (1977–79), president (1977–1986) and chairman of the board (1986–2004) of the Atlanta Hawks while Turner was their owner,[13] and Seretean was also a former president and general manager of the Hawks (1975–77) and a former board member of Turner Broadcasting System.[citation needed]
