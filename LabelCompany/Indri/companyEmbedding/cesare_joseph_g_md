             Specialty        







 


Orthopedic Surgery 

                                As an orthopedic surgeon in Pennsylvania, Dr. Cesare is trained to detect and treat all forms of damage to the musculoskeletal system, including the tendons, ligaments, joints, bones, and muscles. Once a diagnosis has been achieved, Dr. Cesare will typically resort to surgery when other treatment plans have been exhausted or eliminated. Patients may require the attention of an orthopedic surgeon for sports injuries, sprains, torn ligaments, fractures, and more.
