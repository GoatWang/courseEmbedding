Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corp. »
Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation (MREIC), which was organized in 1968, is a publicly-owned real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in net-leased industrial properties subject to long-term leases primarily to investment grade tenants. MREIC's current tenants include: Anda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Anheuser-Busch, Best Buy, Caterpillar Logistics Systems, Coca Cola, FedEx, Keebler/Kelloggs, Sherwin-Williams, and Siemens. The high quality of MREIC's portfolio gives investors the unique opportunity of investing in institutional quality real estate while at the same time receiving the high yields generally available only with more speculative investments. The Company's property portfolio consists of 73 industrial properties and one shopping center located in 26 states, totaling approximately 9.2 million square feet of gross leasable area. In addition, the company owns a portfolio of REIT securities.

Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation has a long history of dividends and profitability. MREIC was one of the few REITs that maintained its cash dividend during the worst economic downturn since the great depression. MREIC has a very successful dividend reinvestment plan that generates substantial liquidity and capital resources.
