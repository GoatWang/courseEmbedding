Returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75%.




The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results. 




The Blended Index consists of the following components: 85% Russell 2000® Index and 15% S&P Developed Ex-U.S. Small Cap Index. Index is unmanaged, does not reflect the deduction of fees or expenses; and is not available for direct investment.

Portfolio Positioningas of 03/31/2017

The Alpha Strategy Fund outperformed its benchmark, a blend consisting of 85% Russell 2000® Index/15% S&P Developed Ex-U.S. SmallCap® Index, during the first quarter of 2017.  During the period, both the Fund’s strategic allocation and performance of the underlying investment strategies contributed to relative performance.
The Fund’s allocations to international small-cap equities and domestic small-cap growth stocks contributed to relative performance, as both strategies outperformed the Fund’s benchmark.
The Fund’s weightings in domestic small-cap value and domestic micro-cap value stocks detracted from relative performance, as these categories underperformed the Fund’s benchmark.
During the quarter, the Fund’s weighting in the consumer discretionary sector declined, while its allocation to the information technology sector increased. The industrials, financials, and information technology sectors are the largest weightings in the Fund.

SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS
Please inform the fund company or your financial intermediary at the time of your purchase of fund shares if you believe you qualify for a reduced front-end sales charge.
Reducing Your Class A Share Front-End Sales Charge
 You may purchase Class A shares at a discount if you qualify under the circumstances outlined below. To receive a reduced front-end sales charge, you must let the fund or your financial intermediary know at the time of your purchase of fund shares that you believe you qualify for a discount. If you or a related party have holdings of eligible funds (as defined below) in other accounts with your financial intermediary or with other financial intermediaries that may be combined with your current purchases in determining the sales charge as described below, you must inform a fund or your financial intermediary. You may be asked to provide supporting account statements or other information to allow us or your financial intermediary to verify your eligibility for a discount. If you or your financial intermediary do not notify a fund or provide the requested information, you may not receive the reduced sales charge for which you otherwise qualify. Class A shares may be purchased at a discount if you qualify under either of the following conditions:

Rights of Accumulation - A purchaser may combine the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund currently owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any eligible fund in order to reduce the sales charge on the new purchase. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes.
To the extent that your financial intermediary is able to do so, the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds determined for the purpose of reducing the sales charge of a new purchase under the Rights of Accumulation will be calculated at the higher of: 1) the aggregate current maximum offering price of your existing Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds or 2) the aggregate amount you invested in such shares (including dividend reinvestments but excluding capital appreciation) less any withdrawals. You should retain any information and account records necessary to substantiate the historical amounts you and any related purchasers have invested in eligible funds. You must inform a fund and/or your financial intermediary at the time of purchase if you believe your purchase qualifies for a reduced sales charge; you may be requested to provide documentation of your holdings in order to verify your eligibility. If you do not do so, you may not receive all sales charge reductions for which you are eligible.

Letter of Intention — In order to reduce your Class A front-end sales charge, a purchaser may combine purchases of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund the purchaser intends to make over the next 13 months in determining the applicable sales charge. The 13-month Letter of Intention period commences on the day that the Letter of Intention is received by a fund, and the purchaser must tell a fund that later purchases are subject to the Letter of Intention. Purchases submitted prior to the date the Letter of Intention is received by a fund are not counted toward the sales charge reduction. Current holdings under Rights of Accumulation may be included in a Letter of Intention in order to reduce the sales charge for purchases during the 13-month period covered by the Letter of Intention. Shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or distributions are not included. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes. Class A shares valued at 5% of the amount of intended purchases are escrowed and may be redeemed to cover the additional sales charges payable if the intended purchases under the Letter of Intention is not completed. The Letter of Intention is neither a binding obligation on you to buy nor on a fund to sell any or all of an intended purchase amount.

Purchaser — A purchaser includes: 1) an individual; 2) an individual, his or her spouse, and children under the age of 21; 3) retirement and benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, money purchase plan, defined benefit plan, and 457(b) plan sponsored by a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, school district, or church to which employer contributions are made, as well as SIMPLE IRA plans and SEP-IRA plans; or 4) a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing shares for a single trust, estate, or single fiduciary account. An individual may include under item (1) his or her holdings in eligible funds as described above in IRAs, as a sole participant of a retirement and benefit plan sponsored by the individual's business, and as a participant in a 403(b) plan to which only pretax salary deferrals are made. An individual and his or her spouse may include under item (2) their holdings in IRAs, and as the sole participants in retirement and benefit plans sponsored by a business owned by either or both of them. A retirement and benefit plan under item (3) includes all qualified retirement and benefit plans of a single employer and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all qualified retirement and benefit plans of multiple employers registered in the name of a single bank trustee.
Eligible fund — An eligible fund is any Lord Abbett-sponsored fund except for (1) each portfolio of Lord Abbett Series Fund, Inc., (2) Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. ("Money Market Fund") (except for holdings in Money Market Fund, which are attributable to any shares exchanged from the Lord Abbett-sponsored funds), and (3) any other fund the shares of which are not available to the investor at the time of the transaction due to a limitation on the offering of a fund's shares.
Front-end Sales Charge Waivers
 Class A shares may be purchased without a front-end sales charge under any of the following conditions:

purchases of $1 million or more (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases by retirement and benefit plans with at least 100 eligible employees (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases for retirement and benefit plans made through financial intermediaries that perform participant recordkeeping or other administrative services for the plans and that have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases made by or on behalf of financial intermediaries for clients that pay the financial intermediaries fees in connection with fee-based advisory program, provided that the financial intermediaries or their trading agents have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases; and
certain other types of investors may qualify to purchase Class A share without a front-end sales charge as described in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




A Note about Risk: The Fund invests primarily in U.S. and global small, mid-sized and micro-cap stocks, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than large cap company stocks.  The value of the underlying funds' investments and the net asset values of the shares of both the Fund and the underlying funds will fluctuate in response to various market and economic factors related to equity markets, as well as the financial condition and prospects of issuers in which the underlying funds invest.  Investments in small, mid-sized and micro-cap company stocks typically involve greater risk, particularly in the short term, than those in larger, more established companies.  Investments in either growth or value stocks may shift in and out of favor for long periods of time, depending on market and economic conditions.  Investing internationally involves risks not associated with investing solely in the United States, such as currency fluctuation, political risk, differences in accounting and the limited availability of information.  These risks can be greater in the case of emerging country securities.  The Fund is subject to the risks associated with derivatives, which may be different from and greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other investments.  These factors can affect Fund performance.




 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 



Class A  Except as noted below, returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 2.25% for all tax-free income funds, fixed income funds and multi-asset class funds. There are also ongoing 12b-1 service fees (and, in certain cases, distribution fees).
Class A Shares purchased subject to a front-end sales charge have no contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). However, certain purchases of Class A shares made without a front-end sales charge may be subject to a CDSC of 1% if the shares are redeemed before the first day of the month in which the one year anniversary of the purchase falls. The CDSC is not reflected in the performance with maximum sales charge.



With Sales Charge - Returns with sales charges reflect applicable fees and expenses and include all distributions reinvested.
 
 




Without Sales Charge - Returns shown are without sales charges and have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
 




Double-Digit Returns - instances of high double-digit returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable over time.   
 






Indexes reflect total return, unless otherwise specified, with all dividends reinvested. Indexes are unmanaged, do not reflect the deduction of fees or expenses, and are not available for direct investment.
 
 
















Lipper Category Average - Peer group averages are based on universes of funds with the same investment objectives. The average return for the peer group is based on the returns of each individual fund within the group for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
 




Fund Expense Ratio Detail: Reflects expenses for the Fund's fiscal year-end and is subject to change. Fund expenses may fluctuate with market volatility. A substantial reduction in Fund assets (since its most recently completed fiscal year), whether caused by market conditions or significant redemptions or both, will likely cause total operating expenses (as a percentage of Fund assets) to become higher than those shown.




 
Gross Expense Ratio includes Management fees, Distribution and Service (12b-1) fees, Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, and Other Expenses. 
 




The net expense ratio takes into account a voluntary fee waiver that Lord Abbett may discontinue at any time. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses. Without such waivers, performance would have been lower.




 
Lipper Category Average Expense Ratio reflects the average net expenses of Class A shares of all funds with in the peer group based on Lipper data available.
 




The Fund's portfolio is actively managed and portfolio characteristics, such as individual holdings and sector weightings may change significantly over time. The portfolio data is for information only. It does not constitute a recommendation or an offer for a particular security or fund, nor should it be taken as a solicitation or recommendation to buy or sell securities or other investments.  
 




Dividends and Capital Gains: The information presented in this section is intended for general information and is not intended to be relied upon and should not be relied upon, as financial, legal or tax advice for any particular investor. We strongly recommend that you contact your financial, legal or tax advisor regarding your particular tax situation.




The information presented in this section is not written or intended to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding any tax liabilities or penalties.

securities described and undertaking to furnish them, upon written request, in the accordance with applicable
law, the information furnished to offerees.*


Irrevocably appointing each of the Secretary of the SEC and, the Securities Administrator
or other legally designated officer of the State in which the issuer maintains its principal

Item 1.�������������Summary Term Sheet
�
Reference is made to the Summary Term Sheet of the Offer to Purchase that is attached as Exhibit (a)(1)(i) and is incorporated herein by reference.


Item 2.������������ Subject Company Information
�
(a)��������The name of the issuer is Alpha Core Strategies Fund (the �Fund�), a non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The principal executive offices of the Fund are located at 50 South La Salle Street, Chicago, IL 60603. The telephone number of the Fund is (312) 630-6000.
�
The Fund is structured as a �master� fund, and the Fund�s feeder funds, Alpha Core Strategies Feeder Fund, Q.P. and Alpha Core Strategies Feeder Fund (collectively, the �Feeder Funds�), invest all their assets in the Fund. All portfolio investments are made at the Fund level. This structure is sometimes called a �master/feeder� structure. The Fund�s feeder funds are series of a Cayman Islands unit trust whose securities are offered in the United States pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and which are exempted from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, are simultaneously permitting redemptions of their own interests and units pursuant to the terms of their organizational agreements.
�
(b)��������The title of the securities being sought is common units of beneficial interest (�Common Units�). As of�November 30, 2014 there were 33,893,949 Common Units issued and outstanding.
�
(c)��������The Common Units are not currently traded on an established secondary trading market.
�
Item 3.�������������Identity and Background of Filing Person
�
(a)��������The Fund is tendering for its own Common Units.��The principal executive offices of the Fund are located at 50 South La Salle Street, Chicago, IL 60603. The telephone number of the Fund is (312) 630-6000.
�
Item 4.�������������Terms of the Transaction
�
(a)(1)���(i)��������The Fund is offering to purchase (the �Offer�) up to a number of Common Units having an aggregate net asset value (�NAV�), as of the last calculation of NAV preceding the expiration of the Offer, of $20,000,000.00.
�
(ii)�������Holders of Common Units (�Unitholders�) that desire to tender Common Units for purchase must do so by 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on�February 13, 2015 (the �Expiration Date�). Immediately after the Expiration Date, each Unitholder whose Common Units (or
�


� 


3





� 



portion of them) have been accepted for repurchase, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated�January 15, 2015 (the �Offer to Purchase�), will be issued and will be bound by the terms of a repurchase instrument (the �Repurchase Instrument�) reflecting the Fund�s agreement to pay the Common Unitholder an amount equal to the NAV, determined as of the Valuation Date (as defined below), of the repurchased Common Units (the �Payment Amount�).
�
The Repurchase Instrument will be non-interest bearing, non-transferable and non-negotiable.��Once issued a Repurchase Instrument, an investor will no longer be a Unitholder of the Fund under applicable state law and will not have the rights of a Unitholder, including without limitation voting rights.��However, until payment in respect of the Repurchase Instrument is made, an investor will continue to be treated as a partner in the Fund for U.S. income tax purposes and to have the rights that a Unitholder would have to inspect the books and records of the Fund and to receive financial and other reports relating to the Fund.��A Unitholder who is issued a Repurchase Instrument is referred to herein as a �Payee.� The Repurchase Instrument will be held by The Northern Trust Company, as escrow agent, on behalf of the Payee.
�
Each Payee will be entitled to receive the Payment Amount, equal to the NAV, determined as of�March 31, 2015 (the �Valuation Date�), of the repurchased Common Units.��Payment in respect of the Repurchase Instrument will be made following the determination of the NAV of the Common Units as of the Valuation Date, but in no event later than the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the Valuation Date, or (ii) if the Fund has requested withdrawals of its capital from any Sub-Fund in which the Fund is invested in order to fund the repurchase of the repurchased Common Units, within ten (10) business days after the Fund has received at least 90% of the aggregate amount withdrawn by the Fund from the Sub-Funds (the �Payment Date�). The Repurchase Instrument may be prepaid, without premium, penalty or notice, at any time on or after the Valuation Date. A copy of the Offer to
Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and a form of the Repurchase Instrument is attached hereto as Exhibit (a)(1)(i), Exhibit (a)(1)(ii) and Exhibit (a)(1)(iii), respectively. Reference is hereby made to the Cover Page, Section 2 �Offer to Purchase and Price� and Section 6 �Repurchases and Payment� of the Offer to Purchase, which are incorporated herein by reference.
�
For purposes of calculating the value of the repurchased Common Units, the amount payable to the Payee will take into account and include all Fund income, gains, losses, deductions and expenses until the Valuation Date.
�
Although the amounts required to be paid by the Fund under the Repurchase Instrument will generally be paid in cash, the Fund may under certain limited circumstances pay all or a portion of the amounts due by an in-kind distribution of securities.��The Fund intends to make an in-kind payment only under the limited circumstance where the Fund receives an in-kind distribution from Sub-Funds of transferable securities that the Fund cannot liquidate itself prior to the Payment Date.
�
(iii)������The Offer is scheduled to expire on�February 13, 2015, unless extended. Reference is hereby made to the Cover Page, Summary Term Sheet, Section 2 �Offer to

�
(a)(2)����Not applicable.
�
(b)��������To the Fund�s knowledge, affiliates of the Fund (other than the Feeder Funds) do not intend to tender to the Fund in response to the Offer.��The Feeder Funds are simultaneously permitting redemptions of their own interests and units pursuant to the terms of their organizational agreements and will tender a corresponding number of Common Units to the Fund.���To the Fund�s knowledge, affiliates of the Fund do not intend to redeem interests and units in the Feeder Funds in connection with the Offer.��The Offer is available equally to the Feeder Funds and investors in the Fund on the same terms.
�

Outsourced Alternatives Intelligence








Choosing alternative strategies is NOT a fill-in-the-style box approach. Our research has shown the dispersion of returns between the best and worst performers is up to four times greater in alternative strategies than in traditional long-only categories (see Dispersion in Alts).
Quantitative measures, like performance and other risk-adjusted statistics, can lead investors to chase performance, while the qualitative due diligence necessary to distinguish top managers can be incredibly time-consuming.
Many investors have turned to multi-strategy alternative solutions, causing Morningstar’s multi-alternative category to become the largest alternative category in terms of assets and number of funds. Unfortunately, a vast majority of the largest multi-alternative mutual funds are predominantly exposed to equity and credit risk factors — precisely the risks from which investors are trying to diversify away.
Learn more about how AlphaCore’s alternative solutions complement traditional portfolios with our AlphaCore Fact Sheet.



The AlphaCore Absolute Fund was created seeking to be a simple complement to a moderate risk portfolio.



At AlphaCore, we build customized portfolios utilizing an open architecture methodology for advisors and institutional clients. The AlphaCore Absolute Fund is a streamlined way to access one of our liquid alternatives solutions. It is designed specifically to complement a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.


AlphaCore is investingLEARN MORE



Investing in mutual funds involves risk including the possible loss of principal. Equity market-related swap contracts and options involve leverage risk, tracking risk and counterparty default risk. Option positions may expire worthless exposing the Fund to potentially significant losses.
ETFs and mutual funds are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, the cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETFs and mutual funds and also may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in common stocks and other securities.
The advisor’s dependence on its asset allocation and risk management strategies and judgments about the attractiveness, value and potential appreciation of particular securities and derivatives may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results.
An investor should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information about the AlphaCore Absolute Fund can be found in the Fund’s prospectus. To reach AlphaCore Capital LLC please call 858-875-4100. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
