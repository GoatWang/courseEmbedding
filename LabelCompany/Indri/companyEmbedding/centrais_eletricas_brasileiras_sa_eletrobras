International activities[edit]
Eletrobras was authorized by Act 11.651, sanctioned on April 7, 2008, to operate abroad as an investor in the power sector, by means of consortiums and/or specific purposes companies; it may also have control on enterprises. In order to coordinate this operation, it was created the Superintendence of Operations Abroad, which will operate following the guidelines of its Board of Directors.
For this first period, the Superintendence of Operations Abroad has set forth the priorities as follows:
1) Interconnect new sources of energy in Latin America with the Brazilian power system; 2) Promote the energetic integration between Brazil and the countries of Latin America; and 3) Prospect opportunities for investment in power energy in other countries to benefit the Brazilian economy by generating new markets for the goods and services suppliers segment.
The Superintendence of Operations Abroad has been developing negotiations with several countries in Latin America and Africa:

Angola and Namibia – Feasibility Studies of the AHE[clarification needed] from Baynes, located in the Cunene River, in the border between the two countries;
Argentina – AHE Binacional de Garabi;
Costa Rica – Technical Cooperation Agreement under analysis;
Nicaragua – Appraisal of AHEs from Boboke and Tumarim;
Peru – Analysis of feasibility for use of 15 AHEs, totalizing 20,000 MW;
Uruguay - New transmission lines expanding the already existing electric interconnection between the southern part of Brazil and Uruguay;
Venezuela – Studies for interconnection with the purpose of having an electric interchange between the two countries.

With Bolivia, Colombia, China, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Morocco and Nigeria the contacts are in their initial phase.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA said to ready long-delayed U.S. SEC report with graft loss- Bloomberg
Saturday, 30 Apr 2016 01:55am EDT 
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA:Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, has concluded the first phase of an internal investigation into alleged graft and is planning to take a writedown because of corruption when it files its long-delayed U.S. financial statements in mid-May, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.The company known as Eletrobras will present the 2014 annual report to its auditor, KPMG LLP, and the board for approval before sending it to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by a May 18 deadline, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.Eletrobras postponed the filing three times since April 2015 after KPMG refused to sign off on the report while the company investigated allegations of graft at its Angra 3 nuclear power plant in Rio de Janeiro.Eletrobras hired a team of lawyers and specialists to carry out an internal investigation after the 1.4 gigawatt power plant was mentioned during testimony as part of the sweeping investigation known as Carwash, which began at the state-run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA.Eletrobras relied on the same group of builders that admitted to paying Petrobras executive bribes in exchange for lucrative construction work.At least six Eletrobras executives have been placed on temporary leave as the team, led by British-American law firm Hogan Lovells and Brazilian firm WFaria Advogados, carries out the probe, said the people.

Thursday, 14 Jan 2016 02:54pm EST 
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA:A Brazilian court suspended the operating license for the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, just weeks before owner Norte Energia SA planned to start electricity generation, prosecutors said on Thursday - RTRS.Judge Maria Carolina Valente do Carmo of the Federal Court in Altamira, Para, said the license will be suspended until Norte Energia and Brazil's government meet a previous license requirement to reorganize the regional office of Funai, the national Indian protection agency - RTRS.A judge had already ordered the government and Norte Energia to carry out the Funai restructuring work in 2014, so Valente do Carmo also fined the government and the company 900,000 reais ($225,000) for non-compliance - RTRS.Belo Monte will have an installed capacity of 11,233 megawatts. Its average output, though, will only be about a third of that as the original reservoir was greatly reduced at the request of native groups and environmentalists. - RTRS.These critics objected to the dam blocking one of the last free-flowing major tributaries of the Amazon. They also opposed an early reservoir plan that would have flooded thousands of square kilometers of virgin rain forest - RTRS.Norte Energia, which is building and will operate the dam, is a consortium led by Brazil's state-run utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras; Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais; Brazil's Neoenergia SA and Vale SA - RTRS.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Centrais El¿tricas Brasileiras SA (NYSE:EBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

International activities[edit]
Eletrobras was authorized by Act 11.651, sanctioned on April 7, 2008, to operate abroad as an investor in the power sector, by means of consortiums and/or specific purposes companies; it may also have control on enterprises. In order to coordinate this operation, it was created the Superintendence of Operations Abroad, which will operate following the guidelines of its Board of Directors.
For this first period, the Superintendence of Operations Abroad has set forth the priorities as follows:
1) Interconnect new sources of energy in Latin America with the Brazilian power system; 2) Promote the energetic integration between Brazil and the countries of Latin America; and 3) Prospect opportunities for investment in power energy in other countries to benefit the Brazilian economy by generating new markets for the goods and services suppliers segment.
The Superintendence of Operations Abroad has been developing negotiations with several countries in Latin America and Africa:

Angola and Namibia – Feasibility Studies of the AHE[clarification needed] from Baynes, located in the Cunene River, in the border between the two countries;
Argentina – AHE Binacional de Garabi;
Costa Rica – Technical Cooperation Agreement under analysis;
Nicaragua – Appraisal of AHEs from Boboke and Tumarim;
Peru – Analysis of feasibility for use of 15 AHEs, totalizing 20,000 MW;
Uruguay - New transmission lines expanding the already existing electric interconnection between the southern part of Brazil and Uruguay;
Venezuela – Studies for interconnection with the purpose of having an electric interchange between the two countries.

With Bolivia, Colombia, China, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Morocco and Nigeria the contacts are in their initial phase.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
