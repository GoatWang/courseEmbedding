Amateur career[edit]
Lopez won the New Mexico Women's Amateur at age 12 in 1969, and the U.S. Girls' Junior in 1972 and 1974, at ages 15 and 17, respectively. Shortly after graduation from Goddard High School in Roswell, she played in the U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, first in 1974 and again in 1975 where she tied for second.
As a collegiate freshman in 1976, Lopez was named All-American and Female Athlete of the Year for her play at the University of Tulsa. That year she won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national intercollegiate golf championship and was a member of the U.S. Curtis Cup and World Amateur teams. Lopez left college after her sophomore year and turned pro in 1977, and again was the runner-up at the U.S. Women's Open.[3]
Professional career[edit]
During her first full season on the LPGA Tour in 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including five consecutive. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in July,[4] won the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, LPGA Rookie of the Year, LPGA Player of the Year and was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won another eight times in 1979, and won multiple times in each year from 1980 to 1984, although she played only half-seasons in 1983 and 1984 due to the birth of her first child.[3]
Playing full-time again in 1985, Lopez posted five wins, five seconds and five thirds, won the money title, the scoring title and the Player of the Year Award and was named Associate Press Female Athlete of the Year for a second time. She played only four tournaments in 1986, when her second daughter was born, but came back to win multiple times in 1987-89 - three times each in 1988 and 1989 - and once again won Player of the Year honors in 1988. Lopez' schedule was curtailed again in the early 1990s when her third daughter was born. In 1992 she won twice. Lopez continued to play short schedules - from 11 to 18 tournaments - through 2002, then in 2003 cut back to just a half dozen or fewer events a year.[3]
Although considered one of the greats in the history of women's golf, and the best player from the late 1970s to late 1980s, Lopez did not win many majors and never won the U.S. Women's Open. She finished second at the U.S. Women's Open four times, the last coming in 1997 when she became the first golfer to score in the 60s for all four rounds, yet lost to Alison Nicholas. Her three major championships all came at the LPGA Championship, in 1978, 1985, and 1989.[3]
Lopez was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1987. She was a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 1990 and was captain of the team in 2005. Lopez retired from regular tournament play in 2002 and attempted a return in 2007 and 2008. In her return season, she played six tournaments, failed to make the cut in any of the tournaments and only broke 80 in three of the 12 rounds.[3] In 2008, she played in three events, with a low score of 76, never making the cut. She was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.[5]
Lopez is the only woman to win LPGA Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and the Vare Trophy in the same season (1978). Her company, Nancy Lopez Golf, makes a full line of women's clubs and accessories. She also does occasional television commentary.
Personal[edit]
Lopez was married to Cincinnati sportscaster Tim Melton from 1979 to 1982.[1][6] Shortly after her divorce, she married Major League All-Star baseball player Ray Knight, then a member of the Houston Astros, in October 1982 in Pelham, Georgia.[7] They were married for 27 years and have three daughters. While married, Lopez and Knight lived in Georgia in his hometown of Albany. Since 1986, she has hosted the Nancy Lopez Hospice Golf Classic at the Doublegate Country Club to raise money for Albany Community Hospice, returning yearly even after her divorce from Knight in 2009.[8] She currently resides in The Villages, Florida[9] where she hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the charity AIM (Adventures in Movement), an organization that helps mentally challenged, visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped and other children and adults with special needs. She has hosted the tournament since 1981 and also serves as a National Ambassador with AIM, along with Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan.[10]

Amateur career[edit]
Lopez won the New Mexico Women's Amateur at age 12 in 1969, and the U.S. Girls' Junior in 1972 and 1974, at ages 15 and 17, respectively. Shortly after graduation from Goddard High School in Roswell, she played in the U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, first in 1974 and again in 1975 where she tied for second.
As a collegiate freshman in 1976, Lopez was named All-American and Female Athlete of the Year for her play at the University of Tulsa. That year she won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national intercollegiate golf championship and was a member of the U.S. Curtis Cup and World Amateur teams. Lopez left college after her sophomore year and turned pro in 1977, and again was the runner-up at the U.S. Women's Open.[3]
Professional career[edit]
During her first full season on the LPGA Tour in 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including five consecutive. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in July,[4] won the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, LPGA Rookie of the Year, LPGA Player of the Year and was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won another eight times in 1979, and won multiple times in each year from 1980 to 1984, although she played only half-seasons in 1983 and 1984 due to the birth of her first child.[3]
Playing full-time again in 1985, Lopez posted five wins, five seconds and five thirds, won the money title, the scoring title and the Player of the Year Award and was named Associate Press Female Athlete of the Year for a second time. She played only four tournaments in 1986, when her second daughter was born, but came back to win multiple times in 1987-89 - three times each in 1988 and 1989 - and once again won Player of the Year honors in 1988. Lopez' schedule was curtailed again in the early 1990s when her third daughter was born. In 1992 she won twice. Lopez continued to play short schedules - from 11 to 18 tournaments - through 2002, then in 2003 cut back to just a half dozen or fewer events a year.[3]
Although considered one of the greats in the history of women's golf, and the best player from the late 1970s to late 1980s, Lopez did not win many majors and never won the U.S. Women's Open. She finished second at the U.S. Women's Open four times, the last coming in 1997 when she became the first golfer to score in the 60s for all four rounds, yet lost to Alison Nicholas. Her three major championships all came at the LPGA Championship, in 1978, 1985, and 1989.[3]
Lopez was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1987. She was a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 1990 and was captain of the team in 2005. Lopez retired from regular tournament play in 2002 and attempted a return in 2007 and 2008. In her return season, she played six tournaments, failed to make the cut in any of the tournaments and only broke 80 in three of the 12 rounds.[3] In 2008, she played in three events, with a low score of 76, never making the cut. She was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.[5]
Lopez is the only woman to win LPGA Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and the Vare Trophy in the same season (1978). Her company, Nancy Lopez Golf, makes a full line of women's clubs and accessories. She also does occasional television commentary.
Personal[edit]
Lopez was married to Cincinnati sportscaster Tim Melton from 1979 to 1982.[1][6] Shortly after her divorce, she married Major League All-Star baseball player Ray Knight, then a member of the Houston Astros, in October 1982 in Pelham, Georgia.[7] They were married for 27 years and have three daughters. While married, Lopez and Knight lived in Georgia in his hometown of Albany. Since 1986, she has hosted the Nancy Lopez Hospice Golf Classic at the Doublegate Country Club to raise money for Albany Community Hospice, returning yearly even after her divorce from Knight in 2009.[8] She currently resides in The Villages, Florida[9] where she hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the charity AIM (Adventures in Movement), an organization that helps mentally challenged, visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped and other children and adults with special needs. She has hosted the tournament since 1981 and also serves as a National Ambassador with AIM, along with Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan.[10]

Amateur career[edit]
Lopez won the New Mexico Women's Amateur at age 12 in 1969, and the U.S. Girls' Junior in 1972 and 1974, at ages 15 and 17, respectively. Shortly after graduation from Goddard High School in Roswell, she played in the U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, first in 1974 and again in 1975 where she tied for second.
As a collegiate freshman in 1976, Lopez was named All-American and Female Athlete of the Year for her play at the University of Tulsa. That year she won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national intercollegiate golf championship and was a member of the U.S. Curtis Cup and World Amateur teams. Lopez left college after her sophomore year and turned pro in 1977, and again was the runner-up at the U.S. Women's Open.[3]
Professional career[edit]
During her first full season on the LPGA Tour in 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including five consecutive. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in July,[4] won the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, LPGA Rookie of the Year, LPGA Player of the Year and was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won another eight times in 1979, and won multiple times in each year from 1980 to 1984, although she played only half-seasons in 1983 and 1984 due to the birth of her first child.[3]
Playing full-time again in 1985, Lopez posted five wins, five seconds and five thirds, won the money title, the scoring title and the Player of the Year Award and was named Associate Press Female Athlete of the Year for a second time. She played only four tournaments in 1986, when her second daughter was born, but came back to win multiple times in 1987-89 - three times each in 1988 and 1989 - and once again won Player of the Year honors in 1988. Lopez' schedule was curtailed again in the early 1990s when her third daughter was born. In 1992 she won twice. Lopez continued to play short schedules - from 11 to 18 tournaments - through 2002, then in 2003 cut back to just a half dozen or fewer events a year.[3]
Although considered one of the greats in the history of women's golf, and the best player from the late 1970s to late 1980s, Lopez did not win many majors and never won the U.S. Women's Open. She finished second at the U.S. Women's Open four times, the last coming in 1997 when she became the first golfer to score in the 60s for all four rounds, yet lost to Alison Nicholas. Her three major championships all came at the LPGA Championship, in 1978, 1985, and 1989.[3]
Lopez was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1987. She was a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 1990 and was captain of the team in 2005. Lopez retired from regular tournament play in 2002 and attempted a return in 2007 and 2008. In her return season, she played six tournaments, failed to make the cut in any of the tournaments and only broke 80 in three of the 12 rounds.[3] In 2008, she played in three events, with a low score of 76, never making the cut. She was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.[5]
Lopez is the only woman to win LPGA Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and the Vare Trophy in the same season (1978). Her company, Nancy Lopez Golf, makes a full line of women's clubs and accessories. She also does occasional television commentary.
Personal[edit]
Lopez was married to Cincinnati sportscaster Tim Melton from 1979 to 1982.[1][6] Shortly after her divorce, she married Major League All-Star baseball player Ray Knight, then a member of the Houston Astros, in October 1982 in Pelham, Georgia.[7] They were married for 27 years and have three daughters. While married, Lopez and Knight lived in Georgia in his hometown of Albany. Since 1986, she has hosted the Nancy Lopez Hospice Golf Classic at the Doublegate Country Club to raise money for Albany Community Hospice, returning yearly even after her divorce from Knight in 2009.[8] She currently resides in The Villages, Florida[9] where she hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the charity AIM (Adventures in Movement), an organization that helps mentally challenged, visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped and other children and adults with special needs. She has hosted the tournament since 1981 and also serves as a National Ambassador with AIM, along with Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan.[10]

Amateur career[edit]
Lopez won the New Mexico Women's Amateur at age 12 in 1969, and the U.S. Girls' Junior in 1972 and 1974, at ages 15 and 17, respectively. Shortly after graduation from Goddard High School in Roswell, she played in the U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, first in 1974 and again in 1975 where she tied for second.
As a collegiate freshman in 1976, Lopez was named All-American and Female Athlete of the Year for her play at the University of Tulsa. That year she won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national intercollegiate golf championship and was a member of the U.S. Curtis Cup and World Amateur teams. Lopez left college after her sophomore year and turned pro in 1977, and again was the runner-up at the U.S. Women's Open.[3]
Professional career[edit]
During her first full season on the LPGA Tour in 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including five consecutive. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in July,[4] won the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, LPGA Rookie of the Year, LPGA Player of the Year and was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won another eight times in 1979, and won multiple times in each year from 1980 to 1984, although she played only half-seasons in 1983 and 1984 due to the birth of her first child.[3]
Playing full-time again in 1985, Lopez posted five wins, five seconds and five thirds, won the money title, the scoring title and the Player of the Year Award and was named Associate Press Female Athlete of the Year for a second time. She played only four tournaments in 1986, when her second daughter was born, but came back to win multiple times in 1987-89 - three times each in 1988 and 1989 - and once again won Player of the Year honors in 1988. Lopez' schedule was curtailed again in the early 1990s when her third daughter was born. In 1992 she won twice. Lopez continued to play short schedules - from 11 to 18 tournaments - through 2002, then in 2003 cut back to just a half dozen or fewer events a year.[3]
Although considered one of the greats in the history of women's golf, and the best player from the late 1970s to late 1980s, Lopez did not win many majors and never won the U.S. Women's Open. She finished second at the U.S. Women's Open four times, the last coming in 1997 when she became the first golfer to score in the 60s for all four rounds, yet lost to Alison Nicholas. Her three major championships all came at the LPGA Championship, in 1978, 1985, and 1989.[3]
Lopez was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1987. She was a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 1990 and was captain of the team in 2005. Lopez retired from regular tournament play in 2002 and attempted a return in 2007 and 2008. In her return season, she played six tournaments, failed to make the cut in any of the tournaments and only broke 80 in three of the 12 rounds.[3] In 2008, she played in three events, with a low score of 76, never making the cut. She was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.[5]
Lopez is the only woman to win LPGA Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and the Vare Trophy in the same season (1978). Her company, Nancy Lopez Golf, makes a full line of women's clubs and accessories. She also does occasional television commentary.
Personal[edit]
Lopez was married to Cincinnati sportscaster Tim Melton from 1979 to 1982.[1][6] Shortly after her divorce, she married Major League All-Star baseball player Ray Knight, then a member of the Houston Astros, in October 1982 in Pelham, Georgia.[7] They were married for 27 years and have three daughters. While married, Lopez and Knight lived in Georgia in his hometown of Albany. Since 1986, she has hosted the Nancy Lopez Hospice Golf Classic at the Doublegate Country Club to raise money for Albany Community Hospice, returning yearly even after her divorce from Knight in 2009.[8] She currently resides in The Villages, Florida[9] where she hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the charity AIM (Adventures in Movement), an organization that helps mentally challenged, visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped and other children and adults with special needs. She has hosted the tournament since 1981 and also serves as a National Ambassador with AIM, along with Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan.[10]

Shortly after graduation from Goddard High School in Roswell, she played in the U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, first in 1974 and again in 1975 where she tied for second.
As a collegiate freshman in 1976, Lopez was named All-American and Female Athlete of the Year for her play at the University of Tulsa. That year she won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national intercollegiate golf championship and was a member of the U.S. Curtis Cup and World Amateur teams. Lopez left college after her sophomore year and turned pro in 1977, and again was the runner-up at the U.S. Women's Open.[3]
Professional career[edit]
During her first full season on the LPGA Tour in 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including five consecutive. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in July,[4] won the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, LPGA Rookie of the Year, LPGA Player of the Year and was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won another eight times in 1979, and won multiple times in each year from 1980 to 1984, although she played only half-seasons in 1983 and 1984 due to the birth of her first child.[3]
Playing full-time again in 1985, Lopez posted five wins, five seconds and five thirds, won the money title, the scoring title and the Player of the Year Award and was named Associate Press Female Athlete of the Year for a second time. She played only four tournaments in 1986, when her second daughter was born, but came back to win multiple times in 1987-89 - three times each in 1988 and 1989 - and once again won Player of the Year honors in 1988. Lopez' schedule was curtailed again in the early 1990s when her third daughter was born. In 1992 she won twice. Lopez continued to play short schedules - from 11 to 18 tournaments - through 2002, then in 2003 cut back to just a half dozen or fewer events a year.[3]
Although considered one of the greats in the history of women's golf, and the best player from the late 1970s to late 1980s, Lopez did not win many majors and never won the U.S. Women's Open. She finished second at the U.S. Women's Open four times, the last coming in 1997 when she became the first golfer to score in the 60s for all four rounds, yet lost to Alison Nicholas. Her three major championships all came at the LPGA Championship, in 1978, 1985, and 1989.[3]
Lopez was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1987. She was a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 1990 and was captain of the team in 2005. Lopez retired from regular tournament play in 2002 and attempted a return in 2007 and 2008. In her return season, she played six tournaments, failed to make the cut in any of the tournaments and only broke 80 in three of the 12 rounds.[3] In 2008, she played in three events, with a low score of 76, never making the cut. She was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.[5]
Lopez is the only woman to win LPGA Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and the Vare Trophy in the same season (1978). Her company, Nancy Lopez Golf, makes a full line of women's clubs and accessories. She also does occasional television commentary.
Personal[edit]
Lopez was married to Cincinnati sportscaster Tim Melton from 1979 to 1982.[1][6] Shortly after her divorce, she married Major League All-Star baseball player Ray Knight, then a member of the Houston Astros, in October 1982 in Pelham, Georgia.[7] They were married for 27 years and have three daughters. While married, Lopez and Knight lived in Georgia in his hometown of Albany. Since 1986, she has hosted the Nancy Lopez Hospice Golf Classic at the Doublegate Country Club to raise money for Albany Community Hospice, returning yearly even after her divorce from Knight in 2009.[8] She currently resides in The Villages, Florida[9] where she hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the charity AIM (Adventures in Movement), an organization that helps mentally challenged, visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped and other children and adults with special needs. She has hosted the tournament since 1981 and also serves as a National Ambassador with AIM, along with Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan.[10]

A chubby charmer with a formidable swing, Nancy Lopez joined the Ladies’ Professional Golf Association tour in 1977 and the next year won nine tournaments, $189,000 and a mass of fans who came to be known as “Nancy’s Navy”—her answer to Arnie’s Army. Then one day while Lopez was playing in Hershey, Pa., a handsome Harrisburg sportscaster named Tim Melton broke through the crowd to interview her.
The attraction was immediate, and they married six months later on Nancy’s 22nd birthday. “Everyone thinks my life is perfect,” says Nancy, now 25, but it clearly hasn’t been. Last January Nancy moved out of the couple’s Houston home, and recently she filed for divorce. “Tim is a good, Christian man,” she notes. “We’re just opposites, and I didn’t realize it until this past year. When I met him I was concerned about finding someone who respected me and wasn’t interested in my money. Now I see there are other things in a marriage.”
Although Lopez has won only one tournament so far this year, she doesn’t blame her failed marriage. “When I’m on the golf course I’m in another world,” she insists. “I really concentrate.” Rather, she says, golf handicapped her marriage. “I always said I’d quit the game and have children when I made the Hall of Fame [she hasn’t yet]. But I knew Tim didn’t want me to wait too long. Also, I wanted to play exhibitions for charities, but he thought I should spend that time with him.” When she marries again, she says, “I’ll find someone who understands that for now, my career has to come first.”
That may not be difficult. Since the breakup her gallery has swelled with male fans. But she credits this to a 30-pound weight loss, not her divorce. “When I was fat I had a lot of people watching me because of the way I played. Now I’m getting a lot more gentlemen. It’s a real ego builder.” One particularly visible candidate for Lopez’s affection has been Houston Astros third baseman Ray Knight, a neighbor in Texas who has been spotted in Nancy’s gallery. She’s noncommittal: “Ray and I are good friends. I don’t know what will happen after my divorce.”
That could be next month. To mark the occasion Nancy plans to buy a white Cadillac. “I’ve always wanted one, but I’m afraid if I buy it now I might have to split it with Tim,” she says, aware that Texas is a community property state.
A sports reporter for Channel 13, the ABC affiliate in Houston, Melton still lives in the couple’s home and remains insistently loyal to Nancy. “I don’t want the divorce,” he confesses. “I love Nancy very much. She was a wonderful wife.”
Nancy’s Catholic upbringing in Roswell, N.Mex. prepared her to be a traditional bride. “My parents believed that men were supposed to support women and that women were supposed to take care of men,” she remembers. While she was married, she tried to fulfill that role. “I’d come home at the end of the tour and cook for Tim and iron his clothes,” she says. “I didn’t do it because I had to. I enjoyed it.” Now, when Nancy returns to Houston to pick up clothes or talk to her lawyer, she stays in a motel. “People look at me in a curious way,” she notes. “I know when I got married it was very special for a lot of my fans. I hope that the divorce won’t anger them.”
The end of her marriage dovetailed with her new devotion to physical health. A longtime junk-food addict (Big Macs and french fries were favorites), Nancy had ballooned to 161 pounds last November. That’s when she entered the Palm-Aire health spa in Pompano Beach, Fla. for a total overhaul. “The spa changed my attitude about eating and exercising,” says Nancy, who at 5’4½” now weighs 130 pounds and follows a daily regimen of stretch exercises. The weight loss, she thinks, has even helped her game. “Last year I had a lot of wrist and shoulder injuries,” she says. “I think when you’re overweight, your body just goes berserk.”
Despite her newly svelte shape and single status, Nancy still doesn’t like to go out much. As she puts it: “I don’t mind staying in my hotel and ordering room service.” Last month, though, Nancy took three weeks off from the tour to visit a girlfriend in La Grange, III. There she played golf at the local country club and watched her favorite television shows—Dallas, Magnum, P.I. and Quincy. One night she went to a disco, but none of the men recognized her. “They often don’t,” she says with a smile as wide as the fairway, “without my visor.”
Nancy isn’t alone: Jan Stephenson is also losing in match play
At a pro-am tournament on April 28 in Birmingham, Ala., Jan Stephenson was rounding the course when she hit an unexpected hazard: A deputy sheriff arrived at the clubhouse bearing a petition from her husband seeking to have her declared incompetent and committed to an institution. But after she voluntarily submitted to a psychiatric examination, the suit was dismissed and Stephenson returned to the tournament. (She didn’t win.)
Jan’s romantic life has long been turbulent. Last March 5 the flamboyant blonde married her traveling secretary, Larry Kolb, 28. Two nights later she left him and returned to the tour. Then on April 19 she filed for an annulment. Stephenson claimed she hadn’t realized she was still married to someone else—Fort Worth businessman Eddie Vossler.
Australian-born Stephenson, 30, had been living with Vossler, a 31-year-old oilman. This was a common-law marriage, Jan argued, which nullified her union with Kolb. Late last month, after the events in Birmingham, Kolb responded to her suit for annulment by obtaining a temporary freeze on Stephenson’s assets (nearly $1 million) and asked that a Fort Worth court appoint a guardian of their property. (An agreement has been reached barring her only from selling her assets.)
Last week Jan was venting her frustration with Kolb. “I’ve tried to sit down and talk with him about this like two grown people,” she fumed. “But he just likes to get his name in print.”
Kolb’s lawyer, Douglas Hudman, insists his client is concerned only with Jan’s well-being. In an affidavit filed in Fort Worth, Kolb states that Vossler has put Jan into a “trancelike” state through systematic torture, including beating, choking, sleep and food deprivation, sexual abuse, humiliation and frequent death threats. Hudman has likened the treatment to techniques used on Patty Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Meanwhile Vossler and Jan are once again sharing a home—and a lawyer. “Eddie has never mistreated Jan physically or mentally,” says their attorney, Robert Watson. “They are happily married and stand as one.”
The bizarre triangle began last Christmas when Stephenson and Vossler broke up after one of their frequent fights. Disconsolate, Jan spent the holidays in Paradise Valley, Ariz, with golfer Tom Weiskopf, his wife, Jeanne, and Larry Kolb. Jan has recalled that during their visit she sat looking at Kolb and saying to herself, “I love that man.”
Two months later she was just as sure she had made a mistake. Kolb had alienated her from Vossler, Jan now claims, by making up stories that Eddie was dating other women. Stephenson and Vossler had met in the early ’70s in Fort Worth, when his father, golf pro Ernie Vossler, started coaching her. Since then their relationship has been stormy. Once Vossler came home to find Jan in a white dress. “We’re getting married,” she announced. Snapped Vossler, “We’re never getting married.” But he changed his mind last year, and the couple took out a marriage license. Then Jan backed out.
A reported multimillionaire in his own right, Vossler handled all of Jan’s business affairs until last year when he hired Kolb. The three formed a company called International Sports Concepts Inc., but Vossler fired Kolb in January. Admits Jan, who was married briefly in the early 1970s to an Australian businessman: “It sounds like a soap opera, doesn’t it?”
The drama has taken its toll. Jan, who was the LPGA’s fifth-ranked money earner last year, has made only $27,000 so far this year and has yet to win a tournament. Jan is also worried about keeping some endorsement contracts (e.g., Kentucky Fried Chicken). Still, there are certain advantages to notoriety. When a provocative picture of her languishing on a bed appeared in Fairway magazine last year, her galleries tripled. Says Jan, “There’s no telling what they’ll be like now.”

Net worth
The 60-year-old retired golfer is a real winner as she succeeds to earned more than $5 million dollar prize money during her career.
Without a doubt, she has a glorious career and she might have million dollars of net worth. However, her estimated salary is 42,000 USD.

She was raised by her parents , Domingo and Marina Lopez in Rosewell, New Mexico along with her older sister. Nancy Lopez is of Mexican descendant and was raised in a traditional catholic household. Her mother was housewife who cared for her children and tended household needs, meanwhile her father owned an auto repair business. Her mother and father were immigrants who had come to the United States at an early age.  When Nancy was just eight, she received her first pair of golf clubs and already at the age of 9 started playing tournaments. She soon won her first state championship the following year. Continuing on at the age of 12 Nancy was already playing USGA (United States Golf Association) championships and won twice. During high school, Nancy's school didn't have a golf team for girls, so instead she played on the boys team and helped them win two state championships. She attended Goddard High.By: Elizabeth LeiferEducation  In 1975 Nancy received a scholarship on golf  for the University of Tulsa. Nancy soon left the University in her sophomore year in the pursuit of going pro. Nancy won five straight tournaments including her first championship in 1978.

Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals.

Cincinnati Reds[edit]
Knight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in 1974.[1] He spent all of 1975 and 1976 with the triple A Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in 1977. During that time, the Reds won both World Series titles.
Knight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the "Big Red Machine" following Rose's defection to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1979. Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.
On May 13, 1980, Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets.[2] He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat August 9, 2002.[3] He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.[4]
In 1981, Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. Following the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third.
Houston Astros[edit]
Knight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team once again in 1982, and was used at third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season (96 to 67).
After batting .304 in 1983, Knight was batting only .237 in 1984, and had fallen out of favor with the Astros' organization when he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later.
New York Mets[edit]
Knight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.
Knight came out of the gate eager to prove the Mets wrong, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates.[5] Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight, back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.[6]
The Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.
The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.[7]
He hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.
Baltimore Orioles[edit]
Unable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for 1987, Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding a hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.

Post-playing career[edit]
Upon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in 1993. Early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in 1996 regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the 1994 season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.
Knight managed the Reds from 1996 to 1997, and served as acting manager for a single game in 2003. In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.
Knight is currently a broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, and hosts Nats Xtra, MASN's pregame and postgame show. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster, has playfully referred to him as the "Silver Fox."

1986 Mets reunion[edit]
Knight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who is the Atlanta Braves pitching coach), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre (whose reasons for not attending are unknown). While the official reason given for Knight's absence was a previous commitment, many have speculated that it was more likely because of his treatment by the organization immediately following his heroics in the 1986 World Series.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Ray Knight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now retired LPGA golfer.[10] They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight who is the oldest, Erinn Knight who is the middle, and Torri Knight who is the youngest. He also briefly caddied for her. They lived in Albany, Georgia and also had a home at The Villages, Florida. He also has a son from a previous marriage, Brooks Knight. Knight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.

Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals.

Cincinnati Reds[edit]
Knight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in 1974.[1] He spent all of 1975 and 1976 with the triple A Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in 1977. During that time, the Reds won both World Series titles.
Knight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the "Big Red Machine" following Rose's defection to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1979. Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.
On May 13, 1980, Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets.[2] He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat August 9, 2002.[3] He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.[4]
In 1981, Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. Following the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third.
Houston Astros[edit]
Knight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team once again in 1982, and was used at third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season (96 to 67).
After batting .304 in 1983, Knight was batting only .237 in 1984, and had fallen out of favor with the Astros' organization when he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later.
New York Mets[edit]
Knight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.
Knight came out of the gate eager to prove the Mets wrong, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates.[5] Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight, back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.[6]
The Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.
The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.[7]
He hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.
Baltimore Orioles[edit]
Unable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for 1987, Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding a hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.

Post-playing career[edit]
Upon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in 1993. Early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in 1996 regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the 1994 season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.
Knight managed the Reds from 1996 to 1997, and served as acting manager for a single game in 2003. In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.
Knight is currently a broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, and hosts Nats Xtra, MASN's pregame and postgame show. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster, has playfully referred to him as the "Silver Fox."

1986 Mets reunion[edit]
Knight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who is the Atlanta Braves pitching coach), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre (whose reasons for not attending are unknown). While the official reason given for Knight's absence was a previous commitment, many have speculated that it was more likely because of his treatment by the organization immediately following his heroics in the 1986 World Series.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Ray Knight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now retired LPGA golfer.[10] They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight who is the oldest, Erinn Knight who is the middle, and Torri Knight who is the youngest. He also briefly caddied for her. They lived in Albany, Georgia and also had a home at The Villages, Florida. He also has a son from a previous marriage, Brooks Knight. Knight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.

Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals.

Cincinnati Reds[edit]
Knight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in 1974.[1] He spent all of 1975 and 1976 with the triple A Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in 1977. During that time, the Reds won both World Series titles.
Knight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the "Big Red Machine" following Rose's defection to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1979. Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.
On May 13, 1980, Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets.[2] He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat August 9, 2002.[3] He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.[4]
In 1981, Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. Following the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third.
Houston Astros[edit]
Knight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team once again in 1982, and was used at third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season (96 to 67).
After batting .304 in 1983, Knight was batting only .237 in 1984, and had fallen out of favor with the Astros' organization when he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later.
New York Mets[edit]
Knight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.
Knight came out of the gate eager to prove the Mets wrong, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates.[5] Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight, back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.[6]
The Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.
The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.[7]
He hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.
Baltimore Orioles[edit]
Unable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for 1987, Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding a hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.

Post-playing career[edit]
Upon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in 1993. Early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in 1996 regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the 1994 season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.
Knight managed the Reds from 1996 to 1997, and served as acting manager for a single game in 2003. In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.
Knight is currently a broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, and hosts Nats Xtra, MASN's pregame and postgame show. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster, has playfully referred to him as the "Silver Fox."

1986 Mets reunion[edit]
Knight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who is the Atlanta Braves pitching coach), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre (whose reasons for not attending are unknown). While the official reason given for Knight's absence was a previous commitment, many have speculated that it was more likely because of his treatment by the organization immediately following his heroics in the 1986 World Series.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Ray Knight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now retired LPGA golfer.[10] They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight who is the oldest, Erinn Knight who is the middle, and Torri Knight who is the youngest. He also briefly caddied for her. They lived in Albany, Georgia and also had a home at The Villages, Florida. He also has a son from a previous marriage, Brooks Knight. Knight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.

Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals.

Cincinnati Reds[edit]
Knight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in 1974.[1] He spent all of 1975 and 1976 with the triple A Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in 1977. During that time, the Reds won both World Series titles.
Knight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the "Big Red Machine" following Rose's defection to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1979. Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.
On May 13, 1980, Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets.[2] He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat August 9, 2002.[3] He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.[4]
In 1981, Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. Following the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third.
Houston Astros[edit]
Knight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team once again in 1982, and was used at third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season (96 to 67).
After batting .304 in 1983, Knight was batting only .237 in 1984, and had fallen out of favor with the Astros' organization when he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later.
New York Mets[edit]
Knight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.
Knight came out of the gate eager to prove the Mets wrong, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates.[5] Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight, back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.[6]
The Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.
The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.[7]
He hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.
Baltimore Orioles[edit]
Unable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for 1987, Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding a hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.

Post-playing career[edit]
Upon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in 1993. Early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in 1996 regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the 1994 season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.
Knight managed the Reds from 1996 to 1997, and served as acting manager for a single game in 2003. In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.
Knight is currently a broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, and hosts Nats Xtra, MASN's pregame and postgame show. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster, has playfully referred to him as the "Silver Fox."

1986 Mets reunion[edit]
Knight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who is the Atlanta Braves pitching coach), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre (whose reasons for not attending are unknown). While the official reason given for Knight's absence was a previous commitment, many have speculated that it was more likely because of his treatment by the organization immediately following his heroics in the 1986 World Series.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Ray Knight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now retired LPGA golfer.[10] They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight who is the oldest, Erinn Knight who is the middle, and Torri Knight who is the youngest. He also briefly caddied for her. They lived in Albany, Georgia and also had a home at The Villages, Florida. He also has a son from a previous marriage, Brooks Knight. Knight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.

Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals.

Cincinnati Reds[edit]
Knight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in 1974.[1] He spent all of 1975 and 1976 with the triple A Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in 1977. During that time, the Reds won both World Series titles.
Knight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the "Big Red Machine" following Rose's defection to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1979. Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.
On May 13, 1980, Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets.[2] He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat August 9, 2002.[3] He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.[4]
In 1981, Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. Following the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third.
Houston Astros[edit]
Knight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team once again in 1982, and was used at third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season (96 to 67).
After batting .304 in 1983, Knight was batting only .237 in 1984, and had fallen out of favor with the Astros' organization when he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later.
New York Mets[edit]
Knight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.
Knight came out of the gate eager to prove the Mets wrong, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates.[5] Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight, back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.[6]
The Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.
The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.[7]
He hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.
Baltimore Orioles[edit]
Unable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for 1987, Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding a hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.

Post-playing career[edit]
Upon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in 1993. Early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in 1996 regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the 1994 season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.
Knight managed the Reds from 1996 to 1997, and served as acting manager for a single game in 2003. In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.
Knight is currently a broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, and hosts Nats Xtra, MASN's pregame and postgame show. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster, has playfully referred to him as the "Silver Fox."

1986 Mets reunion[edit]
Knight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who is the Atlanta Braves pitching coach), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre (whose reasons for not attending are unknown). While the official reason given for Knight's absence was a previous commitment, many have speculated that it was more likely because of his treatment by the organization immediately following his heroics in the 1986 World Series.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Ray Knight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now retired LPGA golfer.[10] They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight who is the oldest, Erinn Knight who is the middle, and Torri Knight who is the youngest. He also briefly caddied for her. They lived in Albany, Georgia and also had a home at The Villages, Florida. He also has a son from a previous marriage, Brooks Knight. Knight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.

Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals.

Cincinnati Reds[edit]
Knight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in 1974.[1] He spent all of 1975 and 1976 with the triple A Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in 1977. During that time, the Reds won both World Series titles.
Knight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the "Big Red Machine" following Rose's defection to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1979. Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.
On May 13, 1980, Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets.[2] He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat August 9, 2002.[3] He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.[4]
In 1981, Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. Following the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third.
Houston Astros[edit]
Knight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team once again in 1982, and was used at third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season (96 to 67).
After batting .304 in 1983, Knight was batting only .237 in 1984, and had fallen out of favor with the Astros' organization when he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later.
New York Mets[edit]
Knight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.
Knight came out of the gate eager to prove the Mets wrong, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates.[5] Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight, back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.[6]
The Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.
The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.[7]
He hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.
Baltimore Orioles[edit]
Unable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for 1987, Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding a hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.

Post-playing career[edit]
Upon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in 1993. Early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in 1996 regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the 1994 season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.
Knight managed the Reds from 1996 to 1997, and served as acting manager for a single game in 2003. In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.
Knight is currently a broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, and hosts Nats Xtra, MASN's pregame and postgame show. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster, has playfully referred to him as the "Silver Fox."

1986 Mets reunion[edit]
Knight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who is the Atlanta Braves pitching coach), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre (whose reasons for not attending are unknown). While the official reason given for Knight's absence was a previous commitment, many have speculated that it was more likely because of his treatment by the organization immediately following his heroics in the 1986 World Series.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Ray Knight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now retired LPGA golfer.[10] They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight who is the oldest, Erinn Knight who is the middle, and Torri Knight who is the youngest. He also briefly caddied for her. They lived in Albany, Georgia and also had a home at The Villages, Florida. He also has a son from a previous marriage, Brooks Knight. Knight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.

ArchiveOn the Beach No More, Nancy Lopez and Ray Knight Score a Tie for Golf and BaseballBy Richard LemonPosted on April 25, 1983 at 12:00pm EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 



Nancy Lopez and Ray Knight, at 26 and 30, are more alike than their sports. Both were pushed as athletes from their youth by demanding fathers and grew up to become pros in their fields. Both are religious (Southern Baptist), neither smokes or drinks (not even coffee or cola in his case), and both are notably gracious to fans. More significantly, both have had marriage failures that sent them into slumps on the job, which, not incidentally, helped bring them together. Soon they’ll have even more to share.
Lopez, who has been favored to lead the Ladies Professional Golf Association this year, announced last month that she is quitting the tour in July to await the birth of a baby—her first, Ray’s second. The Knights can certainly afford her maternity leave: Nancy recently became one of the five woman golfers who have won more than $1 million in prize money (the others: Donna Caponi, Kathy Whitworth, JoAnne Carner, Pat Bradley), and Ray’s five-year contract as first baseman for the Houston Astros brings him a hefty $2.5 million. Their marriage last October and the baby due in November represent for Nancy, in particular, a kind of joyous upheaval that had been missing from her life.
It was only six years ago that the cheery 21-year-old from a close Mexican-American family in Roswell, N.Mex. made her debut in pro golf. In an awesome first season she won five straight tournaments, a streak no other female golfer has ever equaled. The next season she took an amazing eight of 19 tourneys.
But then, almost as suddenly, her game, and her life, turned ragged. Having just broken an engagement to one man, she married and divorced another. She ballooned to 161 pounds (on a 5’4½” frame), lost the odd but natural swing she trusted, and slid from first on the LPGA money list to seventh last year (she is third so far in 1983). It was during the unhappiness of her three-year marriage to TV sportscaster Tim Melton that her game really unraveled. “I knew I needed something else in my life to make me happy,” she says, “and I would go out on the golf course and play terribly. I cried for days.”
Lopez and Knight both know the strain that jock stardom can put on a marriage, though Nancy insists the cause of her split with Melton “wasn’t career problems. We just grew apart.” Of his 1981 divorce from Terri Schmidt after a five-year marriage, Ray says, “I was devastated. I had a good wife, but she just did not understand what I was going through to achieve success.” Ray and Nancy first met in Japan in 1978, when she was in a tournament and he was playing exhibition games with the Cincinnati Reds. Pete Rose introduced them. “Ray was sweet,” Nancy says. “I saw how nice he was with autograph seekers. I know a lot of athletes, but he seemed healthier, warmer. And I loved those blue eyes.”
Later, coincidence kept them in contact. Nancy and Tim moved to Cincinnati when Melton got a job with WCPO, and he and Ray became friends. They saw each other at most of the Reds’ home games. In 1981 Tim went to work in Houston, and later that year Ray, freshly divorced, was traded to the Astros. By the time he got to Houston, Nancy and Tim had parted. Ray discovered this when he took a house near the Meltons’ place and called to say he was in town. “I had thought she was the happiest person in the world,” Ray says. “I was one of the last to know about the separation.” As Nancy tells it, “We started talking about my problems with my marriage, and we realized that we were alike. He had been devastated. So was I. I was playing poorly, and Ray could relate to that because he went into a hitting slump when he got his divorce. I really needed somebody because my family wasn’t there. The only thing I could rely on was Ray as my friend, helping me through rough times.”
When they decided to marry, both agreed they should wait until 1984 for tax reasons. But, says Nancy, “We were so in love we already felt married. So we got married.” The 100-guest wedding was held at the home of a friend of Ray’s in Pelham, Ga., and Ray and Nancy had a delayed November honeymoon in Hawaii after she won the Mazda Japan Classic. She later skipped a tournament to join him at spring training in Florida.
Their schedules make togetherness rare, and they are looking forward to having three full months away from their games between baseball’s end in October and the January start of the 1984 golf tour. Nancy plans to resume playing then and has already hired a nanny to travel with her and her child.
Nancy’s father, Domingo, who owned an auto body shop in Roswell, groomed her to win. “I started playing golf at 8 and won the women’s state amateur at 12,” she says. “But I was so scared I always threw up. I carried a trash can with me. My dad told me, ‘If you’re going to play golf, you’ve got to get over being sick.’ I didn’t want to quit, so I decided to get over it.” She turned pro after two years at the University of Tulsa. Before her mother died in 1977, Nancy told her the kind of man she wanted as an ideal mate: one who was tall, handsome, didn’t smoke or drink and was religious.
Ray fits the specs. He grew up in Albany (pronounced All-benny by the natives), Ga., where his father works for the parks department, and joined the Reds’ farm system right out of Albany Junior College. In 1979, his first regular year in Cincinnati, he was voted MVP, though he played with so many injuries suffered in games or practice he was nicknamed “Battlescar Galactica.” In Houston, Astros President Al Rosen rates him admiringly as “a tough individual who can play hurt. He will be out there 161 games out of 161 games a season if you need him.”
Both Nancy and Ray are strong-willed, or “stubborn,” as Nancy says, “and we won’t give in when we have arguments. But it’s over in 30 minutes, and we’re saying ‘I love you.’ ” He has been teaching her to hunt (“I feel bad after I kill something,” she admits); she gives him golf tips. Although she again plays as Nancy Lopez—”I felt the fans did not relate to me as Lopez-Melton”—at home she’s Nancy Knight.
Just now they have a surfeit of houses between them: two in Houston, two in Palm Coast, Fla., a condo in Cincinnati and, as HQ, a four-bedroom house with a pool in Albany. “I love Albany because I know most of the people, and family means everything to me,” Ray says. “I wouldn’t consider relocating.” Nancy agrees: “It’s a wonderful place to raise children.” The food’s good, too: “Ray’s mother is the best cook in the world—all those wonderful Southern dishes.”
They spend much time meshing three schedules—hers, his and that of Brooks, his 3-year-old son, who lives with his mother in Tampa but visits Ray and Nancy often. “Brooks understands I’m his second mommy,” Nancy says. “I spanked him once. It nearly killed me, and I said to him, ‘I hope you understand I spanked you because I love you.’ ” When she returns to golf after her baby is born, will the new member of the family be a distraction to her game when she’s playing? “When I’m standing over a hole, it’s like nobody else is there,” she says confidently. “I’m alone. I do not hear anything.”

Lopez is LPGA's Knight in Shining Armor
By Lisette Hilton
Special to ESPN.com

"The pain that Nancy suffered as a young player, not being able to golf courses other people could play. But it certainly has molded her life in a way that she doesn't see color," says Ray Knight, Nancy Lopez's husband, on ESPN Classic's SportsCentury series.

Nancy Lopez's rookie season was one of the greatest in golf history.She was Nancy with the laughing eyes.  She had a smile laser-bright, she hit the golf ball off the end of the earth, and she was a cat burglar on the greens. In a sport for the privileged, she was a Mexican-American from a family of modest means.

Nancy Lopez dominated women's golf in the late 1970s and was a major force in the 1980s.  There were seasons when she won more tournaments than many do in an entire career. There was one incendiary stretch when she became the first LPGA golfer to win five straight tournaments.

Lopez was an intense competitor who came into her own with a powerful, unorthodox swing taught her by her father. While she had length, touch and poise, she also had a relaxed attitude despite her fierce concentration. Her winning way with the galleries was of immeasurable help in advancing the sport with the public. Perhaps her greatest triumph is that for all of her accomplishments in a Hall of Fame career, her peers didn't begrudge her that success.

On Lopez's first full year on the LPGA Tour, Hall of Famer Mickey Wright was awed by the 21-year-old's talent. "Never in my life have I seen such control in someone so young," Wright said.

Lopez took the tour by storm, winning 17 tournaments in her first two full years. She remains the only player to win Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year and Vare Trophy (best scoring average) in the same year (1978). A four-time Player of the Year, she has 48 tour victories, including three LPGA Championships. 

She was born on Jan. 6, 1957 in Torrance, Calif., and raised in Roswell, N.M., where the family moved soon after her birth. Her father, Domingo, who owned a local auto repair shop, was the driving force in Nancy becoming a golfer. 

He suggested that his wife, Marina, start playing golf to ease consistent chest pains. Nancy followed her parents around their home course in Roswell. Domingo encouraged his daughter to join in the fun and gave her a sawed-off four wood when she was eight.

Although Lopez didn't have professional lessons growing up, she had the constant coaching of Domingo, who taught his daughter to "play happy." Her father was so convinced that golf was her calling that he wouldn't give Nancy any household chores, in order to preserve her precious golf hands. The family could barely afford orthodontic braces for Lopez but sacrificed so that she would have them. In Domingo's mind, the braces were important for someone who would someday be famous.

Lopez won her first peewee tournament at nine. At 12, she won the New Mexico Women's Amateur. As a teenager she won the U.S. Golf Association Junior Girls Championship in 1972 and 1974.

Being of Mexican descent, Lopez remembered experiencing racism while growing up. "I thought we weren't members of the country club because we couldn't afford it," she said. "Now I think it was discrimination."

Lopez led the otherwise all-boys high school golf team at Goddard High School in Roswell to state titles in 1973 and 1974. Remarkably, as a senior, she tied for second at the U.S. Women's Open in 1975.

The first woman to receive a full golf scholarship to Tulsa, she won the AIAW National Championship as a freshman when she was an All-American and the school's Female Athlete of the Year. She turned pro in 1977 after her sophomore year. 
Nancy Lopez finished second -- or tied for second -- in the U.S. Open four times.In six tournaments that season, she finished second twice. Reflecting on the way she played on the tour early in her career, Lopez said that she often played in the safe, prevailing LPGA style, avoiding bogeys rather than going for birdies. 

The turning point in her life and game was the death of her mother, who died unexpectedly after an appendectomy, in September 1977. Lopez said that the experience made her more mentally powerful.

Playing in 26 tournaments in 1978, the 21-year-old Lopez won nine times and led the tour by earning $189,813. Her first pro victory came in February at the Bent Tree Classic at Sarasota, Fla., when she birdied the 71st hole to beat Jo Ann Washam by a stroke and earn $15,000.

This was just a warm-up for Lopez. In May and June, she set the golf world ablaze by winning five straight tournaments: the Greater Baltimore Classic, the Coca-Cola Classic in Jamesburg, N.J., the Golden Lights Championship in New Rochelle, N.Y., the LPGA Championship, and the Bankers Trust Classic in Rochester, N.Y. 

In winning the LPGA Championship by six strokes over Amy Alcott, Lopez set a tournament record with her 275 on the King's Island course in Ohio.

In 1979, the 5-foot-5 Lopez repeated as Player of the Year, as the Vare Trophy winner with a 71.20 stroke average (.56 better than her rookie year) and as the leading money-winner ($197,488). A sudden-death playoff win over Bonnie Bryant at the Coca-Cola Classic was one of Lopez's eight victories.

After those two years of superstardom, Lopez stopped dominating, although she remained one of the best players on tour. She won three times each in 1981 and 1982.

In May 1982, Lopez divorced sportscaster Tim Melton, whom she had married in 1979, and wed Houston Astros third baseman Ray Knight five months later. 

In 1983, Lopez cut back on playing because of the impending birth of Ashley, the first of her and Knight's three children (all girls). Still, she won two tournaments and exceeded the $1 million mark in career earnings.

After another two-victory season in 1984, the following year Lopez won five times, including gaining her second LPGA Championship when she shot a 273 to coast to an eight-stroke victory over Alice Miller. She was named Player of the Year as she set a record with a stroke average of 70.73.

After playing in only four tournaments in 1986 because of the birth of her second daughter, Erinn, she returned to the tour the following year and won twice. Her victory at the Sarasota Classic (the same event in which she gained her first career win in 1978) was her 35th victory, which qualified her for the LPGA's Hall of Fame. She was inducted on July 20, 1987 as the 11th member.

In 1988, she was named Player of the Year for the fourth time after winning three tournaments. She won three more tournaments the next year, including her third LPGA Championship when she shot 274 to defeat Ayako Okamoto by three strokes.

In the 1990s, Lopez won only six tournaments. Her last title came at the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship in 1997. Since 1999, Lopez has played limited tournaments, due to knee and gallbladder surgeries as well as knee problems.

Where Lopez came up short in her career was at the U.S. Open. She finished second four times. The two that bothered her most were her loss to Hollis Stacy by two strokes in 1977, and in 1997. Lopez, 40, became the first woman to post four rounds in the 60s (69-68-69-69) in the tournament but still lost by a stroke to Alison Nicholas, who shot a 274. 

In 2000, Lopez was recognized as one of the LPGA's top 50 players and teachers during the association's 50th anniversary celebration.

In March 2002, Lopez, 45, announced this would be her final full season on the LPGA Tour. She said she didn't want to be one of those athletes that would keep playing even though she couldn't perform on a high level anymore. Lopez also said that she needed more time to be with what had become her priority: her family.

Just like her Hall of Fame career, family is focus of Nancy Lopez's Hall of Fame exhibit

Nancy Lopez won 48 tournaments on the LPGA Tour and was player of the year four times.


 


But with all of the trophies, medals, clubs and photos in her World Golf Hall of Fame exhibit that commemorate her on-course accomplishments, Lopez hopes fans will come away with one important impression of her life."I hope they see that family was very important to me," Lopez said shortly after touring the Hall of Fame's eighth special exhibit, "Nancy Lopez: Pride, Passion, Personality," which had its grand opening Saturday. "Golf was a big part of my life, but my life and my family was more important. That's where I got my strength, from my family."The Lopez exhibit, the first for an LPGA player, will be shown for a year. Previous special exhibits have honored Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson, Bobby Jones, Gary Player and Bob Hope.Lopez, a native of New Mexico, was taught to play golf at the age of 7 by her father and was rewarded for junior tournament victories with Barbie dolls. She played on her boys high school golf team, won the New Mexico women's amateur at age 12, captured the AIAW individual national championship at the University of Tulsa, then took the LPGA Tour by storm at age 20, when she won nine tournaments (including five in a row).Lopez, 54, remains the only player to have won the LPGA rookie of the year, player of the year and scoring average title in one season.Her main family support system is now her three grown daughters, Ashley Hughey (27), Erinn Knight (24) and Torri Knight (19), who toured the exhibit with her mother Saturday. Many of the exhibits are pictures and mementos of Lopez's childhood away from golf (such as her Communion veil and her Girl Scout merit badge sash) and that of her daughters' childhood.It was the first trip to the Hall of Fame for Lopez's three daughters."We've known she was in the Hall of Fame for a long time [Lopez qualified in 1987], but it was great to do a lot more than read or hear about her career," Erinn Knight said. "When we were kids, it was, 'Mom, you won a tournament? Great, I want a grilled cheese.' We appreciate her career on a whole different level now."Ashley Hughey said golf fans will be able to see the strong family bonds her mother had over the years by touring the exhibit."She's always been family-oriented and you can see just from the photos how close she was to our grandfather," she said. "Almost everything you see here relates in some way to family. She was a daughter and a mother. There was a life outside of golf that was more important to her."Lopez began crying during an interview when relating how she felt about her daughters touring the exhibit for the first time."They're a blessing ... they're very sweet girls and they've always been there for me," Lopez said.To be sure, there are enough artifacts to represent the career of perhaps the best combination of accomplishment and charisma in LPGA history. There's the Ray Cook putter that Lopez used for the first 20 years in her career, the bag representing her first Solheim Cup and trophies for her three LPGA Championships.Almost all of the items came from her home in Albany, Ga. Hall of Fame chief operating officer Jack Peter said an 18-foot truck was required to transport all of it."This was one of our easier special exhibits to put together because everything was in one place," Peter said.After viewing the exhibit, Lopez held court for about 250 fans for a question-and-answer session.About half of the fans came from The Villages, the central Florida retirement community where Lopez has designed golf courses and made several appearances."My fans have made me what I was on the golf course," Lopez said. "They've supported me through ups and downs, through wins and losses, through slumps. They are there rooting for you and cheering you on and I've appreciated them throughout my whole career."garry.smits@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4362
