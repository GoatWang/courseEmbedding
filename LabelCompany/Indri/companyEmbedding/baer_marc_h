Years licensed: Most to least
Years licensed: Least to mostClear all View mapMediationThe mediation process can help you resolve disputes without going to court. In a mediation proceeding, a neutral third party (a mediation lawyer or mediator) meets with you and the person you disagree with. Mediators are trained to find mediation solutions in legal disputes, including divorce mediation and business disagreement mediation. The mediator acts as a facilitator, helping you negotiate until a solution is found. Mediation is the most informal process for dispute resolution and is usually the least expensive method. The drawback is that, unlike an arbitrator in arbitration, the mediator does not make a final decision. So, unless the parties agree and enter into a settlement agreement, the mediation can end without the dispute being solved.Mediation lawyers in cities near Glyndon, MDBaltimoreBel AirColumbiaDundalkEllicott CityGaithersburgGlen BurnieLaurelMillersvilleParkvillePasadenaWestminsterSee all cities in Maryland Nearby attorneys in related practice areasLawsuit / Dispute Attorneys 21136Appeals Lawyers 21136Arbitration Lawyers 21136Litigation Lawyers 21136See all practice areas Set LocationCity and stateCancelSave

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
