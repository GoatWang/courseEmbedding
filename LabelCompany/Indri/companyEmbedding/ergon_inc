Welcome


Ergon is a company that works.


	We’re family owned and operated, brought together more than six decades ago in the petroleum industry’s service sectors. Driven by the values of hard work, customer service, reliable supply and quality products, we’ve grown steadily and strategically over the years to become a well-diversified organization.


	Our companies are engaged in a wide range of operations including sophisticated crude oil processing, marketing naphthenic and paraffinic specialty oils, producing and marketing specialty asphalt products, manufacturing and marketing road maintenance products and machinery, transporting and terminaling raw materials and refined products, propane marketing, oil and gas exploration and real estate development—among other undertakings. Our horizons have expanded since we first began, but our mission remains the same:


Meet needs. Support families. Serve customers.


	We attribute our progress and achievements to one ingredient: our people. Through the efforts of forward-thinking, responsive employees and the integrated relationships of our company’s many components, Ergon has built a synergistic company in the fullest sense of the word.

Refining & Marketing


    Refining & Marketing operations make up Ergon's largest business segment, encompassing the purchase and conversion of crude oil from a wide variety of qualified sources into specialty petroleum products. These refined products are then marketed and distributed worldwide. The Refining & Marketing companies benefit from strategically positioned storage terminals owned and operated by other Ergon subsidiaries and third parties, which facilitate the ability to quickly transport crude and finished products. Ergon leverages the capacities, knowledge and relationships of two independent, collaborative refineries. Both facilities utilize other subsidiaries to maximize throughput, improve efficiency and control quality.








Ergon Refining, Inc. (ERI)

Products: naphthenic process and base oils, brightstock, electrical insulating oils, ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, naphtha, asphalt


    In 1978, Ergon formed Ergon Refining and built its first refinery to produce fuels in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The refinery has grown to be the largest manufacturer of naphthenic process oil in the world and currently has a processing capacity of up to 25,000 barrels of crude oil per day.


    Strategically located 340 river miles north of New Orleans in the Vicksburg Industrial Park just off the Mississippi River, ERI benefits from low transportation costs via river, rail and highway. ERI also enjoys distinct competitive advantages in the process and base oil industries due to its ability to easily obtain and refine naphthenic crude into high-quality finished oils for niche markets worldwide. For cost and efficiency purposes, ERI's sister company Ergon Oil Purchasing, Inc., handles the initial crude purchases and logistics.


    ERI's Vicksburg refinery is the largest manufacturer of specialty naphthenic products in the world.


    Crude oil is shipped to the Ergon-St. James, Inc., terminal located on the Mississippi River in Louisiana. The facility stores the crude before it is shipped to Vicksburg in barges owned and operated by Magnolia Marine Transport Company. ERI currently processes naphthenic heavy crude oils from various fields around the globe that contain aromatic compounds, naphthenic acids, nitrogen compounds and organic sulfur. These crudes are especially corrosive, and there are a limited number of refineries capable of processing them without dilution with more expensive, less acidic crude. ERI utilizes equipment constructed of sophisticated corrosion-resistant metallurgy to process this type of crude oil, and it continues to evaluate naphthenic crude oil sources worldwide.


    Ergon's specialty oils are distributed throughout the globe.


    The refinery is equipped with two hydrotreaters, atmospheric and vacuum distillation towers, three hydrogen gas plants, a sulfur recovery unit and a propane deasphalting unit. ERI produces specialty petroleum products using a distributed digital control system, while an ERI-developed statistical process control system aids operators in maintaining the highest standards of product consistency, repeatability, quality and stability.


    Once production is completed, the specialty oils are stored near the refinery and then sent by barge, truck or rail directly to customers or to bulk storage tanks in terminals around the world. Naphthenic base and process oils produced in Vicksburg are used by Ergon's global customers in numerous applications including transformer oils, compound blending operations, rubber products, chemical processing, printing inks, metalworking fluids, refrigeration oils, hydraulic fracturing oils, paints and greases.


    Ergon International, Inc., an ERI subsidiary, distributes specialty naphthenic insulating oils, base oils and process oils to customers in Eastern Europe, Turkey, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. It maintains a strategically located storage terminal in Belgium, and its licensed distributors are located in Eastern Europe, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. ERI has also expanded its global distribution network to include South America and Mexico.


    Ergon México, S. de R.L. de C.V., provides Mexico with a direct supply of specialty naphthenic and paraffinic products produced at Ergon-owned refineries in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Newell, West Virginia.


    ERI produces multiple grades of residual products in Vicksburg, including industrial asphalt flux used in the roofing and bunker fuel markets. Also at the Vicksburg facility, Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc., produces polymer-modified asphalts, asphalt emulsions and SUPERPAVE  asphalt paving products.


    ERI is 
	ISO 14001:2004 and ISO 9001:2008 certified.

Ergon - West Virginia, Inc. (EWV)

Products: highly refined paraffinic process and base oils, waxes, ultra-low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuels, kerosene solvents, petroleum resins


    Recognizing an opportunity to expand its niche markets to include paraffinic products, Ergon's subsidiary Ergon - West Virginia acquired the Newell, West Virginia, refinery from Quaker State in July 1997. Originally constructed in 1972, the Newell refinery utilizes very high-pressure hydrotreating, solvent dewaxing, vacuum distillation and residuum solvent deasphalting to produce highly refined paraffinic Group II â€œneutralâ€ base oil products, waxes, and Group I bright stock and petroleum resins.  


    EWV currently has the capacity to process up to 23,500 barrels of crude oil per day. EWV processes 100% paraffinic crude oils gathered from approximately 40,000 locations throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and New York.


    The crude refined at EWV provides a very high yield of paraffinic specialty products. It is initially managed by Ergon Oil Purchasing and transferred by truck or pipeline to gathering centers in Ohio and Pennsylvania before moving on to the refinery via truck, barge and pipeline. EWV maintains the flexibility to purchase additional crude from other sources and ship it to the refinery via barge or pipeline.


    Ergon - West Virginia produces highly refined paraffinic specialty products and fuels from local Appalachian grade crude.


    Crude oil is refined using the facility's hydrotreater and Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) dewaxing unit. After the refining process, the ultra-low sulfur fuel products are sold at the refinery truck rack or by barge within EWV's regional market. The paraffinic process and base oils are used in a wide variety of applications including motor oils, gear oils, greases, pharmaceutical and agricultural spray oils and in high-temperature rubber applications.


    The location of the West Virginia refinery is a competitive advantage from a transportation and terminaling standpoint as it is the sole refinery in the northeastern U.S. with significant Group II base oil production. Group II standards were set by the automotive industry to provide better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.


    EWV is ISO 9001:2008 certified.

Process Oils, Inc. (POI)

	Based in Sugarland, Texas, Process Oils is a specialty oils marketer serving the rubber, plastic and lubricant industries. Founded in 1979, POI has established relationships with a variety of specialty oil manufacturers. POI promotes an extensive portfolio of paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic oils, but also has aromatic alternatives for the rubber industry that meet European regulations on high PAH oils. POI serves a primary customer base within the United States and Canada, but is steadily growing towards a worldwide market. 

Ergon Oil Purchasing, Inc. (EOP)

    Ergon Oil Purchasing's roots and core functions stretch back to the earliest days of the Ergon enterprise. EOP purchases crude oil for use at Ergon's refineries and for sale to customers in addition to providing crude oil logistics, division order processing and payments for other Ergon subsidiaries.


    EOP has expanded its crude oil gathering and trading activities in several producing areas across the country. Working in conjunction with its sister companies, new infrastructure and facilities have increased overall storage and throughput capacity. Ergon's midstream companies have improved their logistics capabilities, increasing their ability to gather and transport liquids throughout the United States.

Ergon BioSciences, Inc.

Ergon BioSciences is invested in renewable fuels production. Its subsidiary, Ergon BioFuels LLC, is an ethanol processor with nearly 60-million gallons of annual production capacity at its facility in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Significantly tougher than conventional emulsions, the innovative, new eFlex allows roads to be more tolerant of higher temperatures and more resistant to potential snowplow damage. Its polymer ingredient is available exclusively from Ergon A&E’s labs. Read More »


Featured Treatments


Warm Mix Asphalt (Evotherm)
Warm Mix Asphalt is the latest advancement in paving technology. Compared to conventional HMA, Evotherm allows a 30-50% reduction in mixing and application temperatures and facilitates easier compaction while requiring no change to aggregate gradation or mineralogy. Greenhouse gasses produced at the plant are cut drastically, providing excellent environmental benefits. Worker safety is also improved, as fumes behind the paver and exposure to hot paving materials are greatly reduced.
Micro Surfacing/Slurry
Micro surfacing and slurry seals are cold mix systems customized to perform with varying aggregate mineralogy, climate and surfaces. Both products protect the underlying pavement from further distress and oxidative damage while restoring the driving surface. Friction resistance remains high throughout the life of the treatment. Slurry seal is used on airport runways, mall parking lots, city and residential streets as well as state and county highways. Micro surfacing has the added capability of being applied in thicker lifts. It can be used for specific rut fill situations and/or as leveling and wearing courses for city arterial routes, high ADT highways and interstate systems.
Engineered Emulsion Treatment
EET is an engineered emulsion treatment used in base stabilization or pavement reclamation projects (CIR, HIR, FDR) to upgrade the traffic-bearing capabilities of existing routes. Offering same day return to traffic as well as crack and moisture resistant flexible roadways, EET’s properties are superior to conventional cement or lime-treated bases and FDR projects.

Welcome


Ergon is a company that works.


	We’re family owned and operated, brought together more than six decades ago in the petroleum industry’s service sectors. Driven by the values of hard work, customer service, reliable supply and quality products, we’ve grown steadily and strategically over the years to become a well-diversified organization.


	Our companies are engaged in a wide range of operations including sophisticated crude oil processing, marketing naphthenic and paraffinic specialty oils, producing and marketing specialty asphalt products, manufacturing and marketing road maintenance products and machinery, transporting and terminaling raw materials and refined products, propane marketing, oil and gas exploration and real estate development—among other undertakings. Our horizons have expanded since we first began, but our mission remains the same:


Meet needs. Support families. Serve customers.


	We attribute our progress and achievements to one ingredient: our people. Through the efforts of forward-thinking, responsive employees and the integrated relationships of our company’s many components, Ergon has built a synergistic company in the fullest sense of the word.

Welcome


Ergon is a company that works.


	We’re family owned and operated, brought together more than six decades ago in the petroleum industry’s service sectors. Driven by the values of hard work, customer service, reliable supply and quality products, we’ve grown steadily and strategically over the years to become a well-diversified organization.

Our horizons have expanded since we first began, but our mission remains the same:


Meet needs. Support families. Serve customers.


	We attribute our progress and achievements to one ingredient: our people. Through the efforts of forward-thinking, responsive employees and the integrated relationships of our company’s many components, Ergon has built a synergistic company in the fullest sense of the word.

Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
