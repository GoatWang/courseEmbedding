AfterMaster Audio Labs, a subsidiary of AfterMaster, Inc. (OTCQB:AFTM), is an industry leading audio technology company based in Hollywood, California.  AfterMaster was founded pursuant to a multi-year, multi-million dollar development effort and is driven by innovators focused on exploring bold new possibilities in digital audio processing.   AfterMaster Audio Labs is headed by a group of world class audio engineers and music industry veterans who have been involved with the development and implementation of countless successful proprietary audio technologies and products over the last 25 years as well as an unrivaled resume of hit music recordings.
The AfterMaster Audio Labs mission was to bring Texture, Shape, Form and Emotion back to Consumer Audio.  The rapid adoption of digital audio was a disruptive and highly trans-formative force in not only the music industry, but also the consumer electronics industry. However, few addressed the issue of whether digital audio quality could really be markedly improved.   AfterMaster Audio Labs undertook the challenge of finding innovative ways to take digital audio to significantly greater heights in amplitude, depth and clarity without altering file size or distorting the original recording. Solving the digital audio riddle involved exploring unconventional approaches and pairing technological innovation with the team’s expertise to develop a novel technology that can solve a variety of issues that were limiting the sound quality of digital audio.
After thousands of hours of developing, listening and testing, a true breakthrough in digital audio processing emerged that far surpassed expectations and has the potential to change the industry once again.  That technology is the award winning AfterMaster Audio (“AfterMaster”). AfterMaster Labs maintains five primary business units: Professional music mastering, consumer electronics, online mastering, AfterMaster Recording and Mastering Studios and Audio Consulting services.

 










  



  







AfterMaster Audio Technology


AfterMaster is a groundbreaking and revolutionary audio technology developed for mastering, re-mastering and processing of audio.  It is unlike any other audio enhancement product or mastering process commercially available.  AfterMaster delivers an unparalleled clarity, depth, imaging and fullness to audio recordings while delivering a significant increase in volume without increased distortion, loss of dynamic range or affecting high and low frequencies.  It brings audio alive and creates imaging and depth to the flat sound field inherent in digital audio.  Its versatility and smart processing characteristics make it effective across a broad range of applications stemming from professional recording studios to a standalone speaker unit.
The AfterMaster process is highly sophisticated and was developed by challenging the listening standard for digital audio that became the norm and taking it to a new level.  AfterMaster engineers focused on the core elements of an audio event and its analog to digital to analog conversions and discovered a new and unique pathway to deliver an audio experience that has never been heard before. Thousands of hours of testing, millions of songs and audio sources of all types have been processed using AfterMaster’s award winning technology and the results have spoken for themselves with platinum records, numerous strategic partnerships and overwhelming industry support. What truly makes the AfterMaster system standout is the universal nature of the platform, as it can greatly enhance the listening experience in applications that span far beyond music.
AfterMaster technology is currently used by professional mastering engineers to master music for some of the worlds biggest artists, for online music mastering for independent artists and soon in consumer hardware products.

 










  



  







The Aftermaster Difference


Audio enhancement technologies have been offered for decades and generally focus on using wideners, expander’s and volume boosters.  Traditional enhancers typically add high end exciters and widen the audio to make sound appear to be enhanced, when in reality they lose frequency range, change the balance and degrade the sonic integrity noticeably.  This results in a muddy playback or changes important elements of a recording.  In music, it thins out the drums, vocals, bass, losing the top or bottom and the dynamic range.  In essence, the production style and creative intent of what the artist, engineers, producers and mastering technicians intended for the public to hear is changed by blanket processors.
Unlike other audio post production processes, AfterMaster preserves the original intention of an audio event and brings greater clarity, depth and amplitude to all of the audio elements without changing the integrity of the underlying recording. This is accomplished by AfterMaster’s proprietary and state-of-the-art Adaptive Intuitive Response™ mechanisms and complex algorithms, which provide a ground breaking, pristine listening experience where virtually every sonic detail is heard with added warmth and fidelity.  Indeed, without any compromises, apparent volume, richness and clarity can now be obtained on any device when AfterMaster’s real time intuitive audio enhancement is utilized.

AfterMaster Audio Labs, a subsidiary of AfterMaster, Inc. (OTCQB:AFTM), is an industry leading audio technology company based in Hollywood, California.  AfterMaster was founded pursuant to a multi-year, multi-million dollar development effort and is driven by innovators focused on exploring bold new possibilities in digital audio processing.   AfterMaster Audio Labs is headed by a group of world class audio engineers and music industry veterans who have been involved with the development and implementation of countless successful proprietary audio technologies and products over the last 25 years as well as an unrivaled resume of hit music recordings.
The AfterMaster Audio Labs mission was to bring Texture, Shape, Form and Emotion back to Consumer Audio.  The rapid adoption of digital audio was a disruptive and highly trans-formative force in not only the music industry, but also the consumer electronics industry. However, few addressed the issue of whether digital audio quality could really be markedly improved.   AfterMaster Audio Labs undertook the challenge of finding innovative ways to take digital audio to significantly greater heights in amplitude, depth and clarity without altering file size or distorting the original recording. Solving the digital audio riddle involved exploring unconventional approaches and pairing technological innovation with the team’s expertise to develop a novel technology that can solve a variety of issues that were limiting the sound quality of digital audio.
After thousands of hours of developing, listening and testing, a true breakthrough in digital audio processing emerged that far surpassed expectations and has the potential to change the industry once again.  That technology is the award winning AfterMaster Audio (“AfterMaster”). AfterMaster Labs maintains five primary business units: Professional music mastering, consumer electronics, online mastering, AfterMaster Recording and Mastering Studios and Audio Consulting services.
AfterMaster ProAftermaster Audio Labs has created a completely new category of consumer
electronics product—The Aftermaster Pro™, the world's first Personal
Re-Mastering Device™ that makes all your audio content sound incredible.
Aftermaster Pro has been designed to transform the audio of your television,
smart-phone, headphones, laptop, tablet, gaming unit and virtually any audio
enabled device to a quality level never before experienced.

AFTERMASTER_PRO from AfterMaster Audio on Vimeo.
MasteringMastering is the last step in the creation of a professional audio production. It is done by a mastering engineer who makes the final changes to an audio production to make it the best that it can be. Over time, audio is often re-mastered to make it sound even better than than it did originally. Our world-class team of audio experts have produced, engineered and mastered more hit music than any audio company in history. We know what sounds right. We spent years developing our patented Aftermaster audio technology, a unique audio process that takes sound to levels that we couldn't reach with even the best mastering techniques.
We combined our in-studio expertise with our breakthrough Aftermaster audio technology and created the world's first Personal Re-Mastering Device™ which will re-master all of your audio in real time and transform it to a whole new level—bigger, clearer, fuller, louder and more exciting than anything you've ever experienced before.
Designed For Any Audio Enabled DeviceOur mission with Aftermaster Pro is to provide a convenient and inexpensive way to enjoy all your audio content the way it was intended: with clear, dynamic, and exciting sound. For your TV, Aftermaster Pro hooks up easily between your TV and video source via HDMI cables. Aftermaster Pro will transform your TV audio by automatically raising and clarifying TV dialogue while improving all of the audio quality in the program. No more need to continually adjust the volume of your favorite TV show to hear what people are saying.
The Aftermaster Pro also has a built-in rechargeable battery so it can be used on-the-go with smart phones, tablets, laptops, etc. Aftermaster Pro is easily linked in between your device and headphones or speaker through standard 3.5mm audio cables. Your Pro will instantly re-master all your favorite music and videos and deliver a spectacular audio experience that you can't get anywhere else.
