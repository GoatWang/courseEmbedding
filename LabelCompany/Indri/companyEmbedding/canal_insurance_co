They think they can fix everything with candy and treat us like we are 1st graders. Favoritism is rampant. Something has to change. Everyone is looking for another job at this point.

It is a small, once family owned business, that houses all the components of an insurance package from CEO to clerical staff.ConsMismanagement of qualified and professional claims representatives and their experience. Canal deliver a false sense of employment security and relationship development. Most employees have over 20 years with the company and have come to know and learn how to tolerate those who they consider their equal. Those who are not their equal or propose a threat in any way are constantly bombarded with an absurd war of power by management. I cannot say all management behaves that way, but a couple of bad apples definitely spoils the bunch here.Advice to ManagementPlease respect the employees and their asset to the company. One cannot conduct professional business, build relationships, be involved in self development training AND give attention to the deceptive propaganda that may be created against them by the management department, unbeknowest to the individual. Things would be a lot nicer if personal opinions were not a factor in the overall business environment or if the sensitivities of the managment staff was greatly reduced.

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)
