Donald Trump to Start Fundraising Push in California

Donald Trump’s campaign plans to launch a new fundraising push later this month with a Los Angeles event hosted by Thomas Barrack, the founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital, which sold its stake in Miramax in March.
The Washington Post reported that the event would be held on May 25 and would be followed by dozens of other fundraisers, as Trump shifts to a new campaign finance strategy that will draw on big dollar donors.
Trump’s campaign has said that he will still spend his own money on the campaign. But in an indication that Trump also will tap a network of donors and bundlers, his campaign last week named Steven Mnuchin, chairman and CEO of Dune Capital Management and a major co-financier of Warner Bros. movies, as his national finance chairman.

Barrack’s Colony Capital is a global real estate firm that purchased Miramax from Disney in 2010. But Colony and another shareholder, Qatar Investment Authority, sold their stakes to beIN Media Group in March. Up to that point, Barrack had served as Miramax’s chairman since 2013.
Barrack endorsed Trump in February, calling him “the only candidate in America who comes to the campaign trail already possessing power, wealth and celebrityship.”
“His mastery of financial, political and economic intellectual complexity combined with his charm and emotional intelligence when partnering with New York labor unions, governmental regulatory bodies, Wall Street lenders, sophisticated institutional global investors, demanding developers, global media and entertainment companies and hard-working employees, is a dynastic art form,” Barrack said at the time.
A challenge for Trump’s fundraising will be in raising the hundreds of millions needed to wage a general election campaign in a relatively short period of time.
There is also the question of just how much of the showbiz community will support Trump, as Hollywood’s fundraising traditionally leans heavily to the Democrats. The split so far this cycle is 73% to 27%, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. On May 23, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to make her 12th visit to Los Angeles since announcing her candidacy, with a fundraiser at the home of CAA’s Bryan Lourd and restaurateur Bruce Bozzi, co-hosted by Anna Wintour.
Even so, past GOP nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain have found enough support to make showbiz-focused fundraisers worthwhile as they headed into the general election.
Longtime GOP donors like broadcasting mogul Stanley Hubbard have said that they would back Trump, but others who bundled in the past, like former MGM chief Harry Sloan, have been wary of Trump’s candidacy. Mitt Romney himself continued his criticism of Trump on Wednesday, with a Facebook post that questioned why Trump was not releasing his tax returns.
A spokeswoman for Barrack declined comment. A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment.
It’s expected that the Trump campaign will join with the Republican National Committee for a joint fundraising operation that will allow donors to contribute more than the $2,700 limit to the candidate. Clinton has already formed a joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee called the Hillary Victory Fund. Proceeds from a recent fundraiser at the home of George Clooney went to that fund, in which money is split between the campaign and national and state parties.

Oh here we go, Mr. flip flopper once again, this was the best thing he had going for him, not owned by any corporate donors and what a joke, he never even self funded – loaned it all to himself and will get paid back every red cent with your tax dollars.  This litigious loser has not been consistent on one issue, he is a lifelong DEM, loves Hillary and he will never be able to build the wall or deport millions so what have you got left?

Monetizing the Celebrity Meltdown
Tom Barrack, a billionaire investor who made his fortune in real estate, has discovered a market in distressed celebrities. With Neverland Ranch and Miramax 
under his belt, he’s now on a shopping spree�and bringing along his buddy 
Rob Lowe.

You’ll see why Michael called this place Neverland,� says Tom Barrack, the newest owner of Michael Jackson’s Neverland Valley Ranch. Barrack is a 63-year-old billionaire with a gleaming shaved head, summer-in-Sardinia tan, personally trained muscles, and sockless tasseled loafers. He is sitting on the lawn beside the Tudor-style, panic-room-equipped main house, near a gnarled oak tree with steps winding up to the perch where Jackson wrote Bad.
This, the manicured park with the giant floral clock and movie theater featuring isolation boxes for immunocompromised children�default B-roll for all TV coverage of Jackson�comprises just 32 acres. It scarcely hints at the grandeur of the full property, which is nearly ten times that size, with 67,000 oaks and sycamores, the odd rattlesnake and mountain lion, and a former Chumash Indian worship site overlooking a savannah-like plain. �You’ll feel something, which I think was what drove him,� Barrack says of the Chumash site. �And I don’t mean that�I’m not coming from outer space�but you will actually feel it, I promise.�
When Barrack’s private-equity firm, Colony Capital, took over Neverland in November 2008, averting foreclosure, even the groomed portion was going to seed. Jackson, self-exiled after his child-molestation acquittal to places like Bahrain and Las Vegas, hadn’t been home since early 2005. His 275 employees had dwindled to four. The amusement-park rides and steam train�operable only by California’s single licensed steam-train engineer�had been sold off to raise money. The petting zoo’s animals had been removed by animal-rescue groups; the snakes from the reptile barn were, um, released into the wild.
Since then, Barrack’s team has worked steadily to rehabilitate the estate, refinishing the wood floors, relandscaping acres of grass, introducing more swans into the lakes, and repositioning Jackson’s statue of a long-gun-brandishing pirate to scare off coyotes. In the dance studio, a solitary bulb lights a spot worn down by Jackson’s spinning. The elephant barn now houses a labyrinth of walls filled with effusive notes penned by visitors from around the world. The only obvious reminders of Jackson’s complicated legacy are the bronze statues of children at play that dot the estate.

Barrack built his fortune making deals, and in some ways, Neverland began as just another one�a contrarian bet on a troubled asset, an operating business backed by real estate. Only in this case, the operating business was a person. Colony would bail Jackson out of his substantial debt; in return, the firm would assume ownership of Neverland, and Jackson, after a thirteen-year hiatus, would go back to work to generate new revenue. Jackson’s death, before he could carry out a planned comeback tour, turned the transaction into more of a straightforward real-estate play: Colony is fixing up Neverland and plans to sell it, at some point, for a profit. But after doing the Jackson deal, Barrack and his team began to wonder whether they might have stumbled on a whole new class of investment: the distressed celebrity.
Earlier this year, two financial firms, Cantor Fitzgerald and Media Derivatives, moved to create futures exchanges devoted to betting on film box-office receipts. Neither plan made it through Congress, which was heavily lobbied by Hollywood studios, but these would-be speculators weren’t alone in seeking a new way for Wall Street to enter the cultural marketplace. Earlier this fall, CAA sold a 35 percent stake of its agency to the private-equity firm TPG, modeling the deal on Ted Forstmann’s purchase of IMG in 2004. And while there have always been moneymen willing to buy a stake in the big studios, along with a deep bench of bored tycoons eager to �executive produce� their way into hanging out on set, Hollywood is now luring harder-nosed investors backing individual movies in the full expectation of an attractive return on equity.
Other investors have sought ways to take positions in celebrities themselves. Thirteen years ago, David Bowie famously raised $55 million by issuing so-called Bowie Bonds, paying 7.9 percent interest through album royalties and introducing the concept of securitized intellectual property. Now the model is proliferating. In 2007, Mark Cuban co-founded Content Partners to do for celebrities what structured-settlement firms do for winners of lotteries and lawsuits: pay an up-front lump sum in return for the right to future revenue. (Cuban won’t name names but claims the venture has been �highly profitable.�) Art Capital Group, a high-end pawnshop, lends money to brand-name artists who pledge their paintings and photographs as collateral. 
Over the past two years, Barrack has been lining up deals that target celebrities and entertainment properties whose value he believes to be artificially depressed. In some cases, that’s because they haven’t yet figured out a way to monetize their assets. But mostly it’s because the investment is, in the classic sense, distressed�individuals like Jackson or Annie Leibovitz whose financial mismanagement has obscured their future revenue potential, or properties like the Miramax film library, which Disney is unloading at a time when no one can agree on what a studio archive is worth. This summer, Barrack created a new $500 million media-and-entertainment investment fund, working with his friend Rob Lowe, who is a partner in the fund. Together they have been on something of a shopping spree�and generating a little tabloid coverage while they’re at it. In one TMZ appearance, a paparazzo’s telephoto captured Lowe and Barrack, shirtless, checking their BlackBerrys on a yacht in the Mediterranean. In a second, the two men were video-ambushed as they entered the Mayfair restaurant C London for dinner with owner Giuseppe Cipriani and Formula One’s Flavio Briatore.

Thomas J. Barrack Jr. is a longtime friend of Donald Trump‘s and will be the last person without the Trump name to speak at the Republican National Convention on July 21. Barrack is the founder and CEO of real estate investment firm Colony Capital and also worked in the Ronald Reagan Administration as Deputy Undersecretary of the Department of the Interior. He has been one of Trump’s major donors and formally endorsed him in February. 
Here’s a look at Barrack and Trump’s relationship.

1. Trump & Barrack Have Been Friends Since the 1980s, When Barrack Helped Sell The Plaza Hotel to Trump

Barrack and Trump have been friends since the 1980s and Trump had his eye on buying New York’s Plaza Hotel for awhile. In 1988, Barrack’s boss, Robert Bass, owned it. Just four months after Bass bought the hotel, Barrack was given a green light to negotiate a sale with Trump for the hotel, reports the New York Times. It was about to go to auction, but Trump wanted Bass to skip that process.
“I told him: ‘You’re too good. You’ll want to buy it and it will get tied up in all these contingencies.’ He said, ‘No, it’ll be a real deal.’ I said, ‘No contingencies,'” Barrack recalled in an interview with the Times about the deal. Bass sold Trump the Plaza for $407.5 million. 
“It was a genius deal for Trump because while an auction would have fetched a bigger initial price, it would have been tangled up in contingencies. And he’d just convinced me to fix everything for him,” Barrack told the Times.

2. Barrack Says Trump Is ‘One of the Kindest & Most Humble Friends I’ve Had’ & Thinks He Can Win in November

Before formally endorsing Trump, Barrack was already talking about how great a person his friend is. “I’ve known Donald Trump for almost 30 years. He’s one of the kindest and most humble friends I’ve had,” Barrack told CNBC on February 1. “He’s one of the smartest and most astute businessmen I’ve ever known.”
 

 
Barrack also said that he thinks Trump can win in November and that the country is ready to be run like a business. 
“So, whether you like it or don’t like it, what you’re getting is unfiltered and raw from a guy who’s writing his own checks. I think that’s novel,” Barrack said. 
“Tom has an amazing vision of the future, an ability to see what’s going to happen that no one else can match,” Trump said of Barrack in a 2005 Fortune Magazine interview.
 

 
The Trump campaign released a statement on February 29, announcing Barrack’s formal endorsement of the candidate.

3. Barrack Helped Kick off a Campaign Fundraising Effort in May

In late May, the Trump campaign kicked off an effort to raise $1 billion called “Trump Victory” and it started with a fundraising event at Barrack’s home on May 25 in Los Angeles. The Los Angles Times reported that tickets for the event started at $25,000 per individual or $100,000 per couple. 
Barrack told CNN that he raised $9.5 million from that event for Trump, which Trump even attended. “He was his real, usual class act,” Barrack said of Trump.
 

 
According to Bloomberg, Trump reported to the Federal Election Committee that his campaign raised $94.2 million during his campaign, but $89 million of that was raised in June alone.

4. Barrack Created the Rebuilding America Now Super-PAC to Support Trump, Starting With $32 Million From Donors

In an interview with CNN in June, Barrack announced that he created a Super-PAC called Rebuilding America Now, which was backed by $32 million from four new donors. The group has since created six advertisements. The latest highlighted infamous lies from Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
 

 
“These super PACs have meaning, they have purpose, but they have been viewed historically as being not so trustworthy,” Barrack said on CNN. “So the idea of having a solid, trustworthy — with no skimming, no float — that’s aligned with the candidate but is not coordinating with the candidate, is key.”

5. Barrack Criticized NAFTA & TPP, Just Like Trump

In an essay on globalization that Bloomberg posted, Barrack does not mention Trump, but he makes cases for economic ideas Trump has shared on the campaign trail. He criticizes two of Trump’s favorite punching bags – the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. 
 

 
He calls for new negotiations with Canada and Mexico on NAFTA, as one could “ensure the benefits of trade outweigh its negative impact on American workers and strengthen the alliance among the three North American allies.” In September 2015, Trump was more blunt, calling NAFTA a “disaster” that he would try to “break.” 
In his essay, Barrack makes the case against TPP. Barrack writes that studies showed American workers would not see the benefits of the trade partnership and doesn’t take into account how cheaper labor could be found overseas or how currency manipulation would hurt the U.S.
“The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments,” Trump will say in his speech on July 21 at the convention, via Politico. “I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.”

(Photo by Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)  Donald Trump’s longtime friend Thomas J. Barrack Jr. spoke glowingly about the Republican presidential nominee last week in Cleveland. A California private-equity executive and founder of Colony Capital who has known the candidate for 35 years, Barrack praised Trump’s leadership and perseverance and told stories about real estate development deals they have done together. One deal that didn’t come up that night: Trump and Barrack’s agreement to together develop the Old Post Office in Washington into a 263-room luxury hotel, a partnership that never came to be. Trump and Colony bid for the project together, and when the General Services Administration selected the two companies — beating out a bevy of other hotel and real estate bidders — federal officials expected that the Trump Organization would serve as the lead developer, managing the day-to-day aspects of the project, and Colony Capital would provide financial backing. The two firms issued a joint news release after being selected, saying they would co-invest. Barrack said he was “delighted to team with The Trump Organization to redevelop this historic American landmark while preserving its grandeur and elegance.” “As long-term investors in hospitality, we share the GSA’s vision for transforming this iconic property into one of the finest destination hotels in the country. We look forward to working with the Trump Organization and GSA to make the redevelopment a reality,” he said in the news release. [How the Trumps landed the Old Post Office Pavilion] Colony is a major global investor in real estate, which bolstered Trump’s efforts to secure the deal. At the time, Colony had already invested $45 billion in more than 14,000 corporate and real estate assets, ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide. Most commercial real estate developments are built by similarly formed partnerships; the arrangements allow multiple partners to share both the risks of a project and the potential returns if the project is successful. But a year later, Trump said he and his daughter Ivanka, an executive at his company who leads the project, were reconsidering. Trump told The Washington Post he was “considering Colony and others” as investors and that “every bank wants to do this deal.” “We don’t even need financing,” Trump said at an event hosted by The Post. “We could do it in cash.” Soon thereafter, the Trumps decided to put up the equity for the project themselves, investing $42 million of what they say is their own money and borrowing about $170 million from Deutsche Bank to finance construction. GSA officials have confirmed this arrangement.      Tom Barrack, CEO of Colony Capital, told the Republican National Convention that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is "well-versed enough to do it on his own merits." (The Washington Post)   Colony decided to pull out, although it made no announcement until Monday, when the company’s public relations agency issued a statement to The Post that said: “Colony exited the joint venture after the project’s timeline became too long for the firm. As the project evolved, cheaper sources of capital for longer term investment became available to Trump. Colony simply could not compete with more attractive financing.” Given the loan from Deutsche Bank, this suited the Trumps fine. Ivanka Trump has said on a number of occasions she wanted to keep the company in her family for generations, which is more easily achieved when their company controls the project on its own. Colony wasn’t interested in staying in that long. Ivanka and her family are now moving full steam ahead with the project toward a Sept. 12 opening. The Trump Organization has been hiring staff, booking events and showing the building off to travel agents as construction crews work through the last few weeks of construction. Chef David Burke of BLT Prime is putting together a menu of steak and seafood offerings, and Italian suitmaker Brioni will open its first D.C. location there. Colony’s exit will not look so good for Trump, however, if the Old Post Office deal goes sour — because then it will be his money to lose. Trump’s campaign has prompted some business partners to cut ties with him, but afforded him worldwide brand recognition. Barrack, meanwhile, was given a prime slot at the Republican convention, preceding only Ivanka before Trump took the stage to accept the nomination. Barrack described Trump as a relentless and disciplined businessman. “He really is better than the billing that you see, just as an administrator, as an executive, as a guy who can actually take care of the people that work for him and build teams,” he said.  Follow Jonathan O’Connell on Twitter: @oconnellpostbiz         business capitalbusiness digger     false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.
