The longtime Lionsgate exec also will hold on to his title as Co-COO. The new contract provides Beeks with a $900,000 annual base salary, 50,000 “time-vesting restricted share units,” 150,000 “performance-vesting restricted share units,” 125,000 “time-vesting options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock,” 375,000 “performance-vesting options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock,” plus an annual bonus targeted at half his base salary, the company tells the SEC this morning. Here’s Lionsgate’s announcement:


SANTA MONICA, CA, and VANCOUVER, BC, March 9, 2012 — Steve Beeks, a 14-year veteran of Lionsgate  (NYSE: LGF), has signed a new longterm agreement to continue serving as Lionsgate’s Co-Chief Operating Officer, and he has been named to the additional position of President of Lionsgate’s Motion Picture Group, the  Company announced today as part of the ongoing integration of Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment. In his capacity as Co-Chief Operating Officer, Beeks will continue to report to Lionsgate Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer. He will report to Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Co-Chairs Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger in his role as President of the Motion Picture Group.
Beeks will be responsible for corporate operations and administrative matters for the combined entity, and he will continue to play a key role in the Company’s strategic direction. He also has direct oversight of Lionsgate U.K. and the Company’s home entertainment operations, including packaged media, worldwide television distribution and digital media initiatives.
Within the Motion Picture Group, Beeks will focus on business, financial and planning decisions for the combined Lionsgate and Summit theatrical slates, including their home entertainment releases, while newly named Motion Picture Group President of Production Erik Feig will spearhead creative decisions. Feig will continue to report directly to Friedman and Wachsberger. Beeks’ appointment to Motion Picture Group President under Friedman and Wachsberger will also facilitate an even more integrated approach to Lionsgate’s feature film releases as they are distributed in their theatrical and home entertainment windows.
“With the growth of our combined operations through the recent Summit acquisition and a combined feature film slate that is now capable of generating a billion dollars a year at the North American theatrical box office alone, Steve’s ongoing focus on financial discipline, cost control and overhead management is more critical than ever,” said Feltheimer. “We have achieved one of the best overhead-to-revenue and productivity track records  in the industry in recent years, and Steve will play an integral role in maintaining these imperatives as we continue to grow.”
“Steve and Erik bring complementary strengths to our motion picture group,” said Friedman and Wachsberger.  “Steve’s financial acumen and business leadership, coupled with Erik’s creative prowess and incredible eye for  films with global appeal, position our filmed entertainment operations for continued growth and industry leadership worldwide. Steve’s tremendous knowledge of the home entertainment business will also foster an even more coordinated approach to our feature films’ releases from the theatrical arena through their home  entertainment windows.”
“I’m delighted to work with Jon, Michael Burns, Rob, Patrick, Erik and the rest of our team in building the  Lionsgate brand to the next level of performance, and I look forward to becoming more involved in helping to  build on our theatrical success,” said Beeks. “We are bringing a rich and diverse portfolio ofproduct to our theatrical and home entertainment buyers across traditional and digital platforms alike. As we continue to grow, we want to ensure that we acquire, produce and distribute our content in the most rationalized, targeted and cost-effective ways possible.”
Beeks has led Lionsgate’s home entertainment business to several years of industry leadership in DVD-to-box  office and VOD-to-box office conversion rates. Lionsgate’s home entertainment market share is expected to grow significantly with the combined Lionsgate and Summit slates of product.
Beeks has served as co-Chief Operating Officer of Lionsgate since 2007, and the Company has consistently  achieved one of the best overhead-to-revenue percentages in the industry. He joined Artisan Entertainment,  Lionsgate’s predecessor company, as President of Home Entertainment in 1998. He was named President of  Lionsgate in 2004, shortly after Lionsgate’s acquisition of Artisan, and his title was expanded to include Co-Chief Operating Officer in 2007.

Congratulations to Steve. Fantastic guy, great community member, excellent father. He does it right.












Huh? • 						on  Mar 9, 2012 7:26 am


I don’t get it.  This makes no sense.  So now there are two CHAIRMEN of the MP group (Friedman, Wachsberger).  The new PRESIDENT of the MP (Beeks) group does not report to them.  The new PRESIDENT OF PRODUCTION (Feig) does report to the CHAIRMEN but he does not report to the PRESIDENT?  Who do the heads of marketing, distribution, and international report to?  Sounds like there are four different guys doing the same job.












judypants • 						on  Mar 9, 2012 8:35 am


Who the fuck is Steve Beeks?  President of Motion Picture group AND Co-COO?  Reporting to Patrick and Rob AND to Feltheimer?  This sounds retarded.












Who Asked You Anyway • 						on  Mar 9, 2012 4:48 pm


Worked with Beeks a million years ago and he is a fair guy and a hard worker but for sure not the most empathic.  For anyone who does not know who he is don’t show your ignorance of the business by shouting it out.  I think there is much to be interpreted between the lines as Huh? has pointed out.

Steve Beeks Bullish on Catalog, 4K Ultra HD Releases


26 May, 2016


By: Erik Gruenwedel 






 





Lionsgate co-COO expects flurry of new high-definition format releases by the fourth quarter

Characterizing the launch of 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and digital distribution as being in its infancy, Lionsgate co-COO Steve Beeks says the studio remains ahead of the industry remastering titles for distribution in the new high-definition format. Lionsgate is remastering its top 100 movies in UHD for digital, broadcast and physical release.
“It is an opportunity for us to continue to release, not only new product, but go back to the library and release key titles once again,” Beeks said on a May 26 fiscal call.
The executive expects the winter holidays and fourth quarter to be “pretty big” for 4K releases.
“I think you’re going to see [4K Ultra HD] determine its course over the next several months.”
Separately, Beeks said Lionsgate’s home entertainment library of proprietary and third-party titles earmarked for distribution generated $520 million in revenue in the fiscal year (ended March 31), with contribution to the bottom line of around $200 million.
He said the library business continues to grow — adding 600 titles in the past year — even after posting its largest-year of contribution over the past 10 years, with cash flow approaching $300 million.
Beeks, who is also president of the motion picture group, said third-party companies continue to seek out Lionsgate to distribute and manage their movie libraries because of “our success in that area.”
“The truth is the library business is still very robust for us,” he said.

Stephen John "Steve" Beeks (born 10 April 1971) is an English former professional footballer and coach. In November 2010 Beeks became the trainer of Finnish women's club Åland United.[1]
Playing career[edit]
Beeks made his Football League debut with Aldershot in 1989–90. After three league appearances, he moved on to Woking.[2]
In 1996 Beeks joined Aldershot Town from Staines Town.[3] He became one of eight players to play for both the Aldershot league club and the new club which emerged following bankruptcy.[4]
Coaching career[edit]
In October 2001 Beeks took over at Fleet Town and led the club to promotion from the Wessex League back into the Southern Football League in 2001–02. In September 2002 he resigned, being replaced by Adrian Aymes and Mark Dennis. Beeks blamed finances for his decision: "At the best, the club got its sums wrong, at worst, I've been led up the garden path."[5]
Beeks runs his own football academy.
After joining Åland United, he signed international players Hayley Lauder and Pille Raadik.[6]

Lionsgate given a three-year extension to Steve Beeks, its co-chief operating officer and president of its motion picture group.
The studio made the disclosure May 6 in an 8K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said the extension had gone into effect April 1.
Beeks joined Lionsgate as part of its 2003 acquisition of Artisan Entertainment, where he had been an executive since 1998. He became co-chief operating officer in 2007 and president of the motion picture group in 2012, when he signed a long-term employment agreement.
As motion picture group president, he’s reported to co-chairs Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger and overseen the financial and planning decisions for films, which have included the “Hunger Games,” “Now You See Me” and “Divergent” franchises. Lionsgate became the first independent studio to top $1 billion in annual domestic grosses in 2012.







The filing said Beeks will continue to oversee the company’s day-to-day operations and strategic initiatives with co-chief operating officer Brian Goldsmith. He and Goldsmith report to CEO Jon Feltheimer.
Beeks will receive an annual base salary of $950,000 and will be eligible to receive an annual bonus with a target of 75% of base salary — with the actual amount to be determined by the board’s compensation committee.
He was also granted 33,333 time-vesting restricted share units, 66,667 performance-vesting restricted share units, 116,667 time-vesting options to purchase shares of common stock and 233,333 performance-vesting options to purchase shares. The vesting of the awards will also be subject to an assessment of his performance.
