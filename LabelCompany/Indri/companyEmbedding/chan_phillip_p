Career[edit]
He worked as a Royal Hong Kong Police Force police inspector before entering the entertainment industry. His most memorable moment as a police inspector was during a press conference he held with members of Hong Kong's press at the scene of the 1974 Po Sang Bank robbery, which was one of the biggest bank robbery cases up until then in Hong Kong history. He resigned as a Superintendent of Police in 1976 to join Bang Bang Films as a Producer and simultaneously headed its Advertising Department, marketing the then very popular jeans and apparel brand-name in Hong Kong.
Chan first made his popularity in the then British Colony of Hong Kong by being the lead vocalist for the first all-Chinese college pop group, "The Astro-Notes" (taken after the Astronauts representing the US and the Sputniks representing the USSR during the space race in the early 60s. He became a household name when he joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1965 by displaying courage and leadership in solving several sensational, major crime cases in the British Colony, including the first ever armed bank robbery in 1974 in which 11 hostages were held at ransom. He was nicknamed the "Singing Inspector" when he wrote the lyrics and went on TV to promote road safety for school children. His success in police work earned him a quick promotion to Superintendent of Police in 1975.
In 1976, he was invited by actress Josephine Siu (Siu Fong Fong) and director Pochi Leung to write a police screenplay involving heroin trafficking between Amsterdam and Hong Kong, "Jumping Ash". The upbeat detective movie hit an instant box-office success in 1976, grossing one million dollars in three days and caused the young policeman to consider pursuing his greatest love of his life, films and music. . He resigned from public service to head the film production department and marketing department for Bang Bang Group, which was then the most successful jeans company in Hong Kong. He also took the helm in producing two popular youth programs on Hong Kong Television Broadcasting Limited and the then Rediffusion Television respectively to promote Bang Bang Fashion. He went on to become a renowned actor, script-writer, director and producer, with 14 films under his direction from 1976 to 1990. He is the Honorable Lifetime Chairman of the Hong Kong Film Director's Guild and an Honorable committee member of the Hong Kong Performing Artistes Guild. He was also one of the principal emcees in Hong Kong's leading television station, Hong Kong Television Broadcasting Limited (TVB) for over 15 years.
Intending to strengthen his skills in Management and Marketing, he spent less and less time in acting and producing and eventually became a fully fledged executive working for several commercial conglomerates in Hong Kong:-

1980s general manager, Capital Artist Company (華星娛樂唱片公司) – creating numerous hits and propelling a string of singers into super stardom, including Aaron Kwok (郭富城), Sammi Cheng (鄭秀文), Andy Hui (許志安), Edmond Leung (梁漢文) and Coco Lee (李玟).
1990s managing director, Metro Broadcasts Limited (香港新城電臺) – Hong Kong’s youngest radio station, owned by business tycoon Li Ka Shing was running on loss for five consecutive years since it opened. It was during this time that he produced numerous stage award shows and events that gave Metro Broadcast the success and increase in revenue that was long overdue. In three years he turned the business around.
Late 1990s until early 2000, chief operating officer, Star East Group (東方魅力集團) – a stars/celebrities owned company engaged in the running of themed restaurants (including the then very successful Planet Hollywood). Philip was involved in the opening of the Star East Entertainment complexes in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and the driver of the franchised project in Chengdu. The Group has been sold to another listed company in 2002.
Since 2000 Proprietor and chief operating officer, Endless Idea Management Limited – A promoter of concerts and event marketing in Hong Kong. Apart from supplying Hong Kong stars’ performances and concerts to Mainland China, Singapore, Malaysia and Atlantic City, he also produced the very popular Winter Wonderland in Tsuen Wan for Sino Properties and the same show was, by demand, produced in Donguan, China.
2003–2005 He was the chief executive officer, Mandarin Films (東方電影).
2005–2007 chief operating officer, Emperor Motion Pictures (英皇電影). Once again he became a front-line filmmaker with the opening up of the China market. He simultaneously headed the Emperor Films/Shanghai Film Group joint-venture, the SFG Emperor Film Company (上映英皇电影有限公司)in Shanghai. During this period he produced two films, “Home Run” (回家的路)and the comedy ”The Fantastic Water babes” (出水芙蓉).

Since 1999 he started his penetration into the entertainment market of Mainland China in the fields of television production (the starting up of the Lucky Paid TV Channel in Shanghai), film production (for Emperor Films in the movie "Home Run" and its subsequent distribution. He acted as a consultant for the Canadian independent horror film “Walking the Dead” which was shot on location in Heibei, Northern China in 2009.
For 32 years, he has been one of Hong Kong’s top masters of ceremony and show host. His unique style is the result of his congenial style and personality, his energy and humour. His TV appearances include “The Return Of Hong Kong’s Sovereignty to China”; the annual main Hong Kong beauty pageant “The Miss Hong Kong Pageant”; and the “Eastern China Flood Relief Charity Gala” at the People’s Hall in Beijing to “Miss Playboy International”.
He is the chairman and chief executive officer of Endless Idea Management (Hong Kong) Limited and Fantasia Entertainment Production Group (Macao) Company Limited. These companies engage in event planning and production for major Casinos and Hotels in Macao and Mainland China. He has also formed a new film company, Good Earth Films, to consult and produce for overseas and Chinese film companies in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Chan is the CEO of Endless Idea Management (Hong Kong) Limited and Endless Idea Management (International) Limited, companies which he founded in the 1990s. The two companies engage in the work of artists agent, variety event production, event management and film production consultancy. He is also the CEO of Grand Olympia Films (Hong Kong) Limited. He heads the development of several films to be jointly produced by Mainland China and Hong Kong film companies. One of these films, The Tiger and I, is under pre-production and is due for principal photography in October 2014.

Career[edit]
He worked as a Royal Hong Kong Police Force police inspector before entering the entertainment industry. His most memorable moment as a police inspector was during a press conference he held with members of Hong Kong's press at the scene of the 1974 Po Sang Bank robbery, which was one of the biggest bank robbery cases up until then in Hong Kong history. He resigned as a Superintendent of Police in 1976 to join Bang Bang Films as a Producer and simultaneously headed its Advertising Department, marketing the then very popular jeans and apparel brand-name in Hong Kong.
Chan first made his popularity in the then British Colony of Hong Kong by being the lead vocalist for the first all-Chinese college pop group, "The Astro-Notes" (taken after the Astronauts representing the US and the Sputniks representing the USSR during the space race in the early 60s. He became a household name when he joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1965 by displaying courage and leadership in solving several sensational, major crime cases in the British Colony, including the first ever armed bank robbery in 1974 in which 11 hostages were held at ransom. He was nicknamed the "Singing Inspector" when he wrote the lyrics and went on TV to promote road safety for school children. His success in police work earned him a quick promotion to Superintendent of Police in 1975.
In 1976, he was invited by actress Josephine Siu (Siu Fong Fong) and director Pochi Leung to write a police screenplay involving heroin trafficking between Amsterdam and Hong Kong, "Jumping Ash". The upbeat detective movie hit an instant box-office success in 1976, grossing one million dollars in three days and caused the young policeman to consider pursuing his greatest love of his life, films and music. . He resigned from public service to head the film production department and marketing department for Bang Bang Group, which was then the most successful jeans company in Hong Kong. He also took the helm in producing two popular youth programs on Hong Kong Television Broadcasting Limited and the then Rediffusion Television respectively to promote Bang Bang Fashion. He went on to become a renowned actor, script-writer, director and producer, with 14 films under his direction from 1976 to 1990. He is the Honorable Lifetime Chairman of the Hong Kong Film Director's Guild and an Honorable committee member of the Hong Kong Performing Artistes Guild. He was also one of the principal emcees in Hong Kong's leading television station, Hong Kong Television Broadcasting Limited (TVB) for over 15 years.

Description:

RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. Nos. 61/430,389, filed Jan. 6, 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention concerns compositions and methods useful in selectively modifying the internal and external surfaces of porous polymer beads used in blood, blood product or physiologic fluid purification. This methodology is useful in preserving or imparting hemocompatibility while allowing enhanced binding (or destruction) of proteins, toxins and pathogens.BACKGROUNDTechniques of blood purification via extracorporeal therapy or transfusion related products are reliant on the hemocompatibility of materials used. CytoSorbents has been developing porous polymers for the removal of drugs and proteins for about 11 years. The development of biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can remove substances from blood and physiologic fluids is the core technology. Its flagship product is CytoSorb™, a highly efficient porous bead-based cytokine filter currently in human clinical trials to treat cytokine storm in patients with sepsis and severe lung injury. Blood is pumped out of the body, directly through a CytoSorb hemoperfusion cartridge where the beads remove cytokines broadly, and the purified blood is then pumped back into the body. CytoSorb has been used safely in more than 600 human blood treatments. The polymer beads have passed strict ISO 10993 biocompatibility and hemocompatibility testing, which also includes genotoxicity, acute sensitivity, cytotoxicity and others.Most commercial porous resins are synthesized either by macroreticular synthesis (Meitzner, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,224,415; 1980), such as Amberlite XAD-4® and Amberlite XAD-16® by Rohm and Haas Company or by hypercrosslinking synthesis [Davankov, et al. J. Polymer Science, Symposium No. 47, 95-101 (1974)], used to make the Hpersol-Macronet® resins by Purolite Corp. Many conventional polymeric sorbents have a large pore surface and sorbtion capacity but are not hemocompatible and therefore are not suitable for sorbtion of proteins directly from body fluids.The porous polymeric sorbents specified in the present invention demonstrate compositions and methods useful in selectively modifying the internal and external surfaces of porous polymer beads used in blood, blood product, or physiologic fluid purification. This methodology is useful in preserving or imparting hemocompatibility while allowing enhanced binding (or destruction) of protein toxins and pathogens.SUMMARYIn some aspects, the invention concerns polymer systems comprising at least one polymer, the polymer comprising residues of one or more aromatic monomers and one or more cross-linking agents, the polymer having an external surface and a plurality of pores, the polymer being functionalized with different functional groups on the external surface and on surfaces within the pores.Certain aspects of the invention concern methods of functionalizing a polymer where the methods comprise (a) functionalizing the polymer on substantially all surfaces; and (b) functionalizing in a stepwise manner such that a different functional group resides on the external surface and the internal pore surface of the polymer.Some aspects of the invention concern methods of functionalizing a polymer, the polymer comprising a plurality of pores, the pores having external and internal surfaces, the method comprising functionalizing the external surfaces such that functional groups reside on the external pore surfaces.The invention also concerns methods of functionalizing a polymer, where the polymer comprises a plurality of pores, the pores having external and internal surfaces, the method comprising selectively functionalizing the polymer such that the functional groups reside on the internal pore surfaces.The porous polymers of this invention are constructed from aromatic monomers of styrene and ethylvinylbenzene with crosslinking provided by one of the following or mixtures of the following of divinylbenzene, trivinylcyclohexane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate. Other crosslinking agents that may be used to construct the porous polymeric sorbents of this invention are divinylnaphthalene, trivinylbenzene and divinylsulfone and mixtures thereof.In another embodiment, the polymer sorber is synthesized by an organic solution in which 25 mole % to 90 mole % of the monomer is crosslinking agents such as divinylbenzene and trivinylbenzene, and the resulting polymer sorber has a sufficient structural strength.The porous polymers of this invention are made by suspension polymerization in a formulated aqueous phase with free radical initiation in the presence of aqueous phase dispersants that are selected to provide a biocompatible and a hemocompatible exterior surface to the formed polymer beads. The beads are made porous by the macroreticular synthesis with an appropriately selected porogen (precipitant) and an appropriate time-temperature profile for the polymerization in order to develop the proper pore structure.Porous beads are also made with small pore sizes by the hypercrosslinking methodology which is also known as macronetting or the macronet synthesis. In this methodology, a lightly crosslinked gel polymer—crosslinking usually less than two (2) wt. %—is swelled in a good difunctional swelling agent for the polymeric matrix. In the swollen state, the polymeric matrix is crosslinked by a catalyzed reaction. The catalyzed reaction is most often a Friedel-Crafts reaction catalyzed by a Lewis-acid catalyst. The resulting product is a porous polymer which is a crosslinked polymer having a permanent pore structure in a dry, non-swollen state.For the purposes of this invention, the term “biocompatible” is defined as a condition of compatibility with physiologic fluids without producing unacceptable clinical changes within the physiologic fluids. The term “hemocompatible” is defined as a condition whereby a material when placed in contact with whole blood or blood plasma results in clinically acceptable physiologic changes.In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a polymer system comprising at least one polymer with a plurality of pores, said polymer is initially functionalized on all surfaces via lewis acid, lewis base, free radical or oxidation/reduction reactions.

Some embodiments, after selective surface modification can be further derivatized without a protection/deprotection scheme based on the already fixed functionality.In these embodiments, solvent or aqueous solvent organic maybe viscosified to improve retention in the polymer pores.For the purposes of this invention, the term “macroreticular synthesis” is defined as a polymerization of monomers into polymer in the presence of an inert precipitant which forces the growing polymer molecules out of the monomer liquid at a certain molecular size dictated by the phase equilibria to give solid nanosized microgel particles of spherical or almost spherical symmetry packed together to give a bead with physical pores of an open cell structure [U.S. Pat. No. 4,297,220, Meitzner and Oline, Oct. 27, 1981; R. L. Albright, Reactive Polymers, 4, 155-174 (1986)]. For purposes of this invention, the term “sorb” is defined as “taking up and binding by absorption and adsorption”.XPS data is quantified using relative sensitivity factors and a model that assumes a homogeneous layer. The analysis volume is the product of the analysis area (spot size or aperture size) and the depth of information. Photoelectrons are generated within the X-ray penetration depth (typically many microns), but only the photoelectrons within the top three photoelectron escape depths are detected. Escape depths are on the order of 15-35 Å, which leads to an analysis depth of ˜50-100 Å. Typically, 95% of the signal originates from within this depth. When a sample analyzed is considered for the External Surface, the whole beads or as received is analyzed. When one considers the Internal Surface the sample is ground. Atomic Concentrations are recorded in % and are normalized to 100% of the elements detected. XPS does not detect H or He.Also for purposes of this invention, the terms Lewis acid/Lewis base chemistry refer to a Lewis base is a chemical species with an available (reactive) pair of electrons and a Lewis acid is an electron pair acceptor.For the sake of clarity, some of the preceding embodiments have been tabulated in Table 1 & 2.TABLE 1InitialExternalInternalFunctionReactiveReactiveProtectiveProtectiveFunctionFunction¶ No.alizationOrganicAqueousOrganicAqueousalizationalization0011Yes—ExternalInternal—YX0012Yes—InternalExternal—X′Y′0013YesExternal——InternalY″X″0014YesInternal——ExternalX′″Y′″0015NoExternal——InternalZ—0016No—ExternalInternal—Z′—0017NoInternal——External—Z″0018No—InternalExternal——Z′″ TABLE 2InitialExternalInternalFunctionali-ReactiveProtectiveFunctionali-Functionali-¶ No.zationAqueousGaszationzation0019YesExternalInternalY″″X″″0020NoExternalInternalZ″″— BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 illustrates the concept of protecting solvent.FIG. 2 presents the structure of Triton X-100.FIGS. 3 and 4 represent selectively reacting the inner core with Triton X 100 to leave the exterior hemocompatible.FIG. 5 graphical data of selective hydrolysis.FIG. 6 graphical data of Triton X-100 modification.FIG. 7 illustrates use of a carboxylated CytoSorb polymer with an aqueous interior phase and a diethylether interstitial phase with the reactive alkylating agent like diazomethane to direct the alkylation to the bead exterior.FIG. 8 XPS/ESCA, high resolution analysis overlay of a selective diazomethane reaction.FIG. 9 illustrates an example of use of lipophilic and lipophobic polymer cores and biphasic conditions to exploit free radical grafting on the interior and exterior of the polymer bead which can be augmented by the selection of organic soluble and water soluble free radical initiators.FIG. 10 graphical data of selective free radical grafting of styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTSAs required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limits, but merely as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention. The specific examples below will enable the invention to be better understood. However, they are given merely by way of guidance and do not imply any limitation.Some solutions used in the methods described herein can be viscosified to assist maintaining the fluids within pores during process steps. Viscosification is well known to those skilled in the art and can be accomplished, for example, by dissolving a polymer in the solvent to increase viscosity.With hydrophobic polymer compositions, the polymer may need to be wetted to assist in inclusion of aqueous solutions within the pores. Wetting techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.EXAMPLESExample 1Sorbent SynthesesThe present invention provides for a porous polymer to be protected inside the pore surface with a non-reactive organic solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) while cleaving the exterior reactive functionality under neutral, acidic or basic aqueous conditions. The organic protecting phase could be thickened with a straight chain polymer to insure adhesion to the bead interior. This protecting phase can be eluted at will. This concept is diagramed in FIG. 1.In this example we would then selectively react the inner core with Triton X 100 (FIG. 2) leaving, the exterior hemocompatible FIGS. 3 & 4. CytoSorb polymer is chloromethylated (J. S. Fritz et al., J. Chromatography. A 691, (1995) 133-140) and then treated with toluene. The interstitial liquid (between the beads) is removed and replaced with an aqueous phase to convert the reactive exterior chloromethyls to hydroxymethyls. The protecting solvent is eluted via column chromatography or a Soxhlet apparatus. Further reaction with the sodium salt of Triton X-100 modifies only the interior pore surface leaving the exterior of the bead hemocompatible.Selective Hydrolysis of Chloromethylated Polymer,In a 40 mL glass vial was transferred the chloromethyl polymer 0.52 g, then added 3 mL of toluene to allow the beads to swell for two hours at room temperature, to protect the inside of the beads with organic toluene. Toluene was sucked out with the help of a pipette. Purified water 2.63 mL was added to the polymer and the mixture was heated in an oil bath, provided with a thermocouple at 78° C. for a desired time period with no stirring, occasional shaking was required. This experiment was studied for 2 h, 6 h, 14 h, 24 h and a 70 h time period at 78° C. After the hydrolysis time period was complete, the reaction was cooled to RT (Room Temperature). The aqueous layer was removed via a pipette. The polymer beads were washed with 3 ml of water four times, 3 ml of methanol three times and 2 ml of diethyl ether three times. Let, the polymer air dried for two hours inside the hood, then dried in a high vacuum oven over night at 55° C. The product obtained (0.42 g) in ˜85% yield, was analyzed by XPS/ESCA analysis (Table 3 & FIG. 5). FIG. 5 shows a steep drop in the % Cl during the first 14 hours of hydrolysis for the external surface, while the internal content remains relatively constant.TABLE 3% Cl,% O,% Cl,% O,ExternalExternalInternalInternalRxn time (h)SurfaceSurfaceSurfaceSurface03.75.53.84.622.96.13.84.762.27.33.25.4141.67.53.34.7241.87.53.54.6701.493.04.9 Example 2Sorbent SynthesesIn a three neck round bottom flask provided with nitrogen inlet, rubber septum, addition funnel and a magnetic stirrer were transferred sodium hydride (65%), 0.65 g, 0.0176 mol. The oil in sodium hydride was removed by washing two times with 3 ml of dry toluene. The flask was cooled in an ice bath at 0° C. Transferred 3.5 ml of dry DMF via a syringe into sodium hydride, followed by a very slow addition of a solution of Triton-x-100, 12.3 g, 0.0196 mol in 7.0 ml of dry DMF. Lots of gas evolution and frothing was occurred during the addition. Addition time was 35 minutes. After the addition, let stir for another 30 minutes at 0° C. Ice bath was then removed and the reaction was allowed to warm to RT. Solution tuned brown at the end of formation of the anion and all the sodium hydride was disappeared in 2 h at RT.In a separate 100 ml 3-neck round bottom flask, provided with a nitrogen inlet, rubber septum, addition funnel, mechanical stirrer (glass shaft with a glass blade) and a thermocouple probe were transferred polymer beads, 0.35 g, (chloromethyl group inside the polymer and hydroxyl-methyl outside the polymer), added 7.0 ml of dry DMF via a syringe. To the stirring slurry at 0° C. was added the above prepared anion solution via the addition funnel. This addition was fast in ˜5 minutes. Let stir at 0° C. for 10 minutes, warm to RT in ˜30 minutes and then heated at 55° C. for 16 h.Reaction cooled to RT, quenched with ice-water (10 ml), some exotherm 4-5° C. was observed. Water and DMF were removed by vacuum suction. Polymer beads were washed with water 3 times, 0.1N HCl 2 times, 2-propanol 2 times and toluene 2 times. The washed beads were soxhlet with toluene for 16 h. From the beads toluene was washed with methanol 2 times and with diethyl ether 2 times. After air drying for 2 h inside the hood, beads were dried in high vacuum at 55° C. for 16 h.The dried beads obtained 0.32 g. A sample was analyzed by XPS/ESCA analysis. The data is shown in Table 5 and graphical analysis is shown in FIG. 6. Triton X-100 has significant oxygen content due to the repeating glycol moieties (n=9−10). The % oxygen on the exterior of the 14 hour hydrolysis sample and the Triton X-100 treated sample are very similar. This indicates minimal modification on the exterior of the beads. The internal oxygen content has increased for the Triton X-100 treated sample indicating selective internal modification.TABLE 5% O,% O,% Cl, ExternalExternal% Cl, InternalInternalRxn time (h)SurfaceSurfaceSurfaceSurface14 Hour Sample1.67.53.34.7Triton X-100,0.47.80.59.6Modified Sample Other functional groups besides the chloromethyl group could lend themselves to be utilized via solvent protection in the interior of the porous bead. They include, benzyl aldehydes, carboxylic acids, acid chlorides, amines, epoxides, methyl bromides, benzyl alcohol, sulfonic acids to name just a few.Example 3Sorbent SynthesesThe previous approach exploits the lipophilic nature of the CytoSorb (divinylbenzene ethylvinyl benzene copolymer) pore structure. An alternative approach could be would be to take a lipophobic system for the interior and an organic solvent occupying the bead exterior or interstitial space. This organic solvent is non-reactive with a reactive substrate. One example is a carboxylated CytoSorb polymer (Boudenne J L, et al, Polymer International, 51: (2002) 1050-1057.) with an aqueous interior phase and a diethyl ether interstitial phase with the reactive alkylating agent like diazomethane. This would direct the alkylation to the bead exterior. See FIG. 7.Conversion of Carboxylic Acid to Methyl Ester of Exterior Surface,Generation of Diazomethane: Sigma Aldrich provided 1 g of N-nitroso-N-methylurea in a 100 ml glass bottle. Sigma's bottle was cooled in an ice bath and added 2.50 ml of diethyl ether. In 40 ml glass vial a 40% potassium hydroxide solution was prepared separately, by dissolving 1.2 g KOH and taking up to 3 ml of water. To the KOH solution was added 7.50 ml of ether and the vial was also cooled in an ice bath.Pre-cooled KOH/Ether solution was transferred to the Sigma's bottle cooled in an ice bath. A yellow color started to generate immediately in the ether layer (contains diazomethane).In a separate 40 ml vial was transferred one ml of polymer beads (DVB Polymer/Carboxylic acid). These beads were washed with water 4 times, after the final washing, water was removed via a pipette and the vial was cooled in an ice bath.Transferred ˜2 ml of yellow ether solution to the polymer beads vial, added another few drops, until the yellow color persisted. After 5 minutes the reaction mixture in the ice bath was quenched with ˜2-3 ml of 10% acetic acid.At the end of reaction (no yellow color), aqueous solution was removed by a pipette. The polymer beads were washed 4 times with water, 2 times with methanol and 2 times with ether. Air dried for 2 h, then in high vacuum at 55° C. A sample was submitted for XPS/ESCA, high resolution analysis (Table 6 & 7, FIG. 8). Data discussed below.The external surface of CH2N2 treated Polymer was similar to the DVB Polymer/CO2H starting material but clearly contained excess C—O when compared with the starting material and the ground version (Internal surface) of CH2N2 treated Polymer (see FIG. 7). This is demonstrated quantitatively in Table 7 as C—(O,Cl). [Note that this amount exceeds the total C—(O,Cl) for the starting material leading to the conclusion that there may be some C—O present]. The difference in this value is a measure of the amount of methoxy groups on the surface (˜4 atom %, 10.8-6.5). This is approximately the same as the total amount of O—C═O suggesting near total conversion of COOH to COO—CH3 on the exterior.TABLE 6Atomic Concentrations (in %)Sample% C% O% ClDVB Polymer, CO2H, External85.111.83.2Surface (Starting Material)CH2N2 treated Polymer, External84.712.03.3SurfaceCH2N2 treated Polymer, Internal86.210.53.4Surface TABLE 7Carbon Chemical State (in Atom % of C)C—CC—(O,Cl)O═C—O—(H,R)π-π*SampleAtom %eVAtom %eVAtom %eVAtom %eVDVB Polymer,71.8284.86.586.63.989.22.891.5CO2H, ExternalSurface(StartingMaterial)CH2N2 treated67.7284.810.886.73.689.12.591.5Polymer,External SurfaceCH2N2 treated72.6284.87.386.73.589.12.891.5Polymer, InternalSurface Example 4Sorbent SynthesesThis protecting solvent concept can be extended to free radical grafting chemistry. Divinylbenzene ethylvinyl benzene copolymers have unreacted pendant vinylbenzene groups ranging from 30 to 40% (K. L. Hubbard, J. A. Finch, G. D. Draling, Reactive & Functional Polymers 36 (1998) 17-30). Lipophilic and Lipophobic polymer cores and biphasic conditions can be used to exploit free radical grafting on the interior and exterior of the polymer bead. This can be augmented by the selection of organic soluble and water soluble free radical initiators. An example of this technology is to be found in FIG. 9. The CytoSorb polymer with 4-styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt in an organic solvent (toluene), organic soluble free radical initiator (BPO) is suspended in the bead interior after replacement of the interstitial with an aqueous phase. This allows the system to be initiated thermally directing the graft polymerization to the pore's exterior surface preserving the interior's lipophilic nature.Reaction of DVB Polymer with Styrenesulfonic Acid Sodium Salt Under Free Radical Conditions,In a 3-neck round bottom flask provided with mechanical stirrer, thermocouple and an air condenser were transferred 10 g, of DVB polymer (swelled in 50 ml of toluene for 16 h) with the help of another 10-15 ml of toluene by adding the rinse to the reaction flask. Benzoyl peroxide 0.04 g, was added to the reaction flask at RT and stirred for 10 minutes. Most of the toluene was removed by vacuum suction. Added a slurry of 4-styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt 4.0 g, and sodium chloride 5.0 g in 50 ml of purified water at RT. Cool the reaction flask in an ice bath (7-9° C.), then added a solution of monosodium phosphate 2.55 g, in 10 ml of water (to keep the reaction pH between 4-5, checked by pH paper). Let, stir at 7-9° C. for 2 h. ice bath removed and reaction mixture was allowed to cool to RT and then heated at 80° C. for 16 h. Reaction mixture was cooled back to RT, aqueous contents were removed by vacuum suction. Added 100 ml of water, warm to 55° C. and water removed by suction. The polymer was washed 4 times with water, 3 times with methanol and soxhlet extracted with methanol overnight. Polymer beads were washed 3 times with diethyl ether, air dried for 2 h in a hood and finally in a high vacuum at 55° C. After drying, 8.5 g of product was obtained. A sample was analyzed by XPS/ESCA analysis. The data is shown in Table 8 and graphical analysis is shown in FIG. 10. The sulfur of the styrene sulfonic acid was only detected on the exterior of the bead.TABLE 8Sample% S% O% NaInternal Surface0.01.20.1External Surface0.65.10.7 Example 5Sorbent SynthesesIn addition to non-reacting aqueous or organic solvents as protecting media, air or gasses could be utilized to the same manner. One such example is shown below.Placed two vials each with 1.0 g of Chloromethyl DVB polymer. Set oil bath to 80° C. Added 5 mL of purified water at RT to each vial. Vials placed in oil bath and occasionally shaken by hand. Removed first vial at 10 minutes. Immediately rinsed the sample via vacuum filtration. First washed with cold water, then 2 times methanol, then 3 times diethyl ether. After the ether wash the sample was placed in the oven. Repeated the last 3 steps on the other sample but removed from oil bath after 1 hour. Samples were analyzed by XPS/ESCA analysis. The data is shown in Table 9 and is consistent with higher surface O concentrations and higher interior Cl concentrations.TABLE 9Sample% O% Cl10 min, External5.73.010 min, Internal3.93.9 1 hr, External6.02.6 1 hr, Internal4.03.6 In summary, this protective solvent approach could be applied to polymer beads via:  Free Radical ChemistryOxidation/Reduction ChemistryLewis acid/Lewis base chemistry

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Phillip Chan has the following 1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Diagnostic Radiology
    Radiologists help doctors get a closer look at what’s happening inside your body. If your primary care doctor wants to investigate your symptoms further, they may refer you to a radiologist to get an ultrasound or x-ray. Some radiologists specialize in mammography and breast imaging, which is who you see when you need a mammogram. A Radiologist can also determine if bones are broken or fractured after any kind of accident.


    Radiologists are trained to perform MRIs and CT scans, both of which are used to determine the presence of diseases or disorders and help your doctor properly diagnose you. They can detect anything from tumors, bleeding and infections to bone and muscle disorders.
