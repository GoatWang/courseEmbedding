Connect People and Products With YouTube’s ‘Shoppable’ Channel Gadget

From makeup tips and recipe ideas to home repairs and business recommendations, your customers are using social media for advice every day. Platforms like YouTube have had to adapt, offering visitors more than just entertaining content. Today, people turn to the video-sharing site to learn a new skill, find more information, and shop for products.
This has created a valuable opportunity for brands to reach shoppers and provide them with an easy way to go from watching a video to purchasing a product. To help convert video views into sales, YouTube has introduced a new channel gadget that will enable brands to connect consumers directly with retailers.
Now when someone finds a how-to video featuring your product, he or she can go from watching to finding out which retailers carry it, compare prices, and make a purchase — all the while minimizing the number of unnecessary clicks. It’s also a good way to keep the consumer focused on your product, rather than have someone bookmark the task for later.

Unilever has already built out a YouTube channel to highlight its hair care brand, Tresemmé. According to Google, the company has already generated more than 2.7 million views on its channel. Using the new gadget, the company can now connect those viewers with the products they’re watching in the videos. Individuals can now click on the products used in demos for more information as well as details on how to buy from a variety of retailers.
Powered by Gloto — an “engagement technology company” — the functionality will only work on brand channel pages. This means that videos embedded on other websites, such as your blog, won’t be “shoppable.” The new gadget is being made available as a “premium offering” for Google’s consumer good clients. If you’re interested, contact your Google representative for more details.

Understanding the 6 Facebook Post Types by Practical eCommerce
***** 5 STARS

Facebook Rants and Raves

John Capone details advertising statistics and projections that suggest, over the next couple of years, in terms of advertising revenue, “Google will begin to leave Facebook and the rest (of the major ad sellers) in the dust.” He describes Google as The Predator of the online advertising world, while Facebook is more like Barney the purple dinosaur.
5 reasons your brand doesn’t need Facebook by iMedia Connection
Peter Platt sets out to dispel five “myths” of Facebook marketing, among them that Facebook is an engagement platform for brands: “A couple of years back, we wanted to ‘like’ brands so we could see what their offers were. But all too often, brands became that annoying friend who posted too much, and we quickly learned to hide or unfriend those brands. Brands also started building out complex Facebook platforms with lots of functionality and engagement tools, but the reality is that the news feed is the core of Facebook activity. Complex portals garner some interest, but at the end of the day, the news feed is where most of the users are.”
Before You Buy Into The ‘Zuckerberg Put’: 5 Things Facebook’s CEO Won’t Tell You by Seeking Alpha
Kyle Spencer advises investors that although Mark Zuckerberg may have discovered he really does need to listen to the market, there are five things to keep in mind before diving into this stock, such as that the kids are somewhere else: “There was a time when Facebook was cool. Not anymore. 65% of Facebook users are 35 and older, and adults are the fastest growing demographic…Why is it important where teens hang out? Because parents follow their kids around on the Internet. Teens are the first adopters, the fastest social innovators and have more free time to surf the net. Jumping ship keeps teenagers one step ahead of mom and dad. Remember AOL? It’s an old folks home, now.”
Facebook is for Likes Not Leads by Brent Price Carnduff
Writing that “The truth is, most of those 900 million people (actually over a billion now) aren’t there to be marketed to. And frankly, Facebook doesn’t make it that easy for businesses to connect with them,” Brent Carnduff outlines what he believes Facebook can, and can’t, do for marketers and business owners.
Facebook: Are the Good Times Really Over for Good? by WindMill Networking
Chris Treadaway laments recent changes by Facebook that make it more expensive—much more expensive—for brands to reach fans with their content. He cites recent criticism of the social media network by Mark Cuban, George Takei, and a range of Facebook community managers, yet in the end concludes “It’s going to cost us more to do the things that we’ve gotten for low cost so far…but we won’t go anywhere.” Maybe.

Social Networks Influence 74% of Consumers’ Buying Decisions



							Photo of the author, Jennifer Beese

					on November 16, 2011				












With the holidays just around the corner, spending will increase and many consumers are turning to the Internet for help. According to a study by the digital marketing agency ODM Group, 74% of consumers rely on social networks to guide purchase decisions.
Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have allowed retail brands to effectively market to a wider audience. For consumers, these platforms allow easy access to brands, but also help to guide product decisions and purchases.
On Twitter, 53% of consumers recommend companies or products in their tweets. Of those, 48% follow through with the intent to buy that product or service.

The most effective platforms in terms of mobilizing consumers to talk about products are Facebook with 86%, followed by Twitter at 65%, blogs and reviews are tied at 55%, and videos come in last with 50%. Not only should you have a social presence on these platforms, but you should make sure to monitor closely for mentions of your brand or products.
In terms of listening, businesses use consumer insights in 80% of sales and merchandising decisions. As consumers increasingly turn to the Internet to research and review products, ODM Group believes that by 2014, 53% of total retail sales will be affected by the web.
While the facts aren’t necessarily surprising, the results act as a good reminder to not only understand your target users, but to implement better communication and customer support strategies across social media platforms.
