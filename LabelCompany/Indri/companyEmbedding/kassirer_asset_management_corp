About Us
Kassirer Asset Management is a Toronto-based investment management firm engaged primarily in merger arbitrage. The investment objective is to achieve an absolute rate of return, with low volatility and low correlation to returns in global equity and fixed income markets. To meet this objective, investments are focused on a diversified portfolio of merger arbitrage, event driven, and special situation strategies.


The current low interest rate environment makes merger arbitrage a logical substitute for fixed income.
Our absolute return strategy coupled with low historical volatility, provide an attractive risk-return profile and make our market neutral strategy a rational substitute for a fixed-income allocation. Our strategy may be compelling to investors seeking liquidity and capital preservation while benefiting from rising interest rates.
