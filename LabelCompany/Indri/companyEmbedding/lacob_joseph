Early life[edit]
Lacob grew up in a Jewish family[4] in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father worked at a paper products company, his mother at a local supermarket. His favorite team in boyhood was the Boston Celtics of the NBA. When he was 14, the company that employed his father was sold. The only worker the new owners retained was his dad. The Lacob family relocated to Anaheim, California and Joe switched his allegiance to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[5][6]
Lacob earned a bachelor's degree in biological sciences from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), a master's in public health (epidemiology) from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[7] "I was a very poor kid," Lacob recalled. "Had nothing. I paid every dime of my education through college. Every single dime. I was the first person to graduate from college in the history of my family. Ever. I came from nothing."[5]
Professional career[edit]
Lacob has been a partner at Kleiner Perkins, a Venture capital investing firm, since 1987.[5] His investments have centered around firms involved in life sciences, medical technology, Internet and energy, and such enterprises as AutoTrader.com, Align Technology and NuVasive.[5] Before he joined Kleiner Perkins, Lacob held executive positions with Cetus Corporation (now Chiron), FHP International (a health maintenance organization) and the management-consulting firm of Booz, Allen & Hamilton.[8] In interviews, he has credited his epidemiology degree for giving him a background in statistics that has fed the statistical side of his longstanding sports interest.[9]
He was a primary investor in the American Basketball League, a professional women's basketball league that eventually folded from failure to compete successfully with its rival, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[5] In January 2006 he became part-owner of the Celtics, where he became a co-investor with H. Irving Grousbeck, an entrepreneur and a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[10] On July 15, 2010, Lacob and the group of investors he headed agreed to buy the Golden State Warriors of the NBA from Chris Cohan for $450 million, requiring him to sell his minority interest in the Celtics.[11] The Lacob - Peter Guber group won out over a dozen other bidders for the Warriors, including Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison, 24-Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov and Texas billionaire financier David Bonderman.[12] He had been a Warriors' season-ticket-holder for about a decade.[5] He already had extensive experience operating an NBA team as part-owner of the Boston Celtics, and also points to his friendships with two major league baseball team general managers, Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics and Jeff Moorad of the San Diego Padres, who have both proven that winning records are not solely related to the size of the team payroll.[13] Lacob approved the acquisitions of David Lee and undrafted rookie guard Jeremy Lin, a hometown favorite. He also fired coach Don Nelson and replaced him with assistant coach Keith Smart. The sale was unanimously approved by the NBA league's board of governors on November 12, 2010. Lacob and Peter Guber are the chief owners, but Lacob is in charge of day-to-day operations.[12][14]
Before the 2014-15 NBA season Lacob fired coach Mark Jackson who had just led the Warriors to the playoffs in consecutive seasons. Lacob explained the decision at a conference of fellow venture capitalists: "Part of it was, he couldn't get along with anybody else in the organization. And, look, he did a great job -- and I'll always compliment him in many respects -- but you can't have 200 other people in the organization not like you." [15]
Lacob generated some controversy by calling his team "light years" ahead of everybody else in the NBA during the 2015-16 NBA season. The Warriors won championships in the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.
Personal life[edit]
Lacob has two sons, Kirk[16] and Kent.[17]

"Had nothing. I paid every dime of my education through college. Every single dime. I was the first person to graduate from college in the history of my family. Ever. I came from nothing."[5]
Professional career[edit]
Lacob has been a partner at Kleiner Perkins, a Venture capital investing firm, since 1987.[5] His investments have centered around firms involved in life sciences, medical technology, Internet and energy, and such enterprises as AutoTrader.com, Align Technology and NuVasive.[5] Before he joined Kleiner Perkins, Lacob held executive positions with Cetus Corporation (now Chiron), FHP International (a health maintenance organization) and the management-consulting firm of Booz, Allen & Hamilton.[8] In interviews, he has credited his epidemiology degree for giving him a background in statistics that has fed the statistical side of his longstanding sports interest.[9]
He was a primary investor in the American Basketball League, a professional women's basketball league that eventually folded from failure to compete successfully with its rival, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[5] In January 2006 he became part-owner of the Celtics, where he became a co-investor with H. Irving Grousbeck, an entrepreneur and a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[10] On July 15, 2010, Lacob and the group of investors he headed agreed to buy the Golden State Warriors of the NBA from Chris Cohan for $450 million, requiring him to sell his minority interest in the Celtics.[11] The Lacob - Peter Guber group won out over a dozen other bidders for the Warriors, including Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison, 24-Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov and Texas billionaire financier David Bonderman.[12] He had been a Warriors' season-ticket-holder for about a decade.[5] He already had extensive experience operating an NBA team as part-owner of the Boston Celtics, and also points to his friendships with two major league baseball team general managers, Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics and Jeff Moorad of the San Diego Padres, who have both proven that winning records are not solely related to the size of the team payroll.[13] Lacob approved the acquisitions of David Lee and undrafted rookie guard Jeremy Lin, a hometown favorite. He also fired coach Don Nelson and replaced him with assistant coach Keith Smart. The sale was unanimously approved by the NBA league's board of governors on November 12, 2010. Lacob and Peter Guber are the chief owners, but Lacob is in charge of day-to-day operations.[12][14]
Before the 2014-15 NBA season Lacob fired coach Mark Jackson who had just led the Warriors to the playoffs in consecutive seasons. Lacob explained the decision at a conference of fellow venture capitalists: "Part of it was, he couldn't get along with anybody else in the organization. And, look, he did a great job -- and I'll always compliment him in many respects -- but you can't have 200 other people in the organization not like you." [15]
Lacob generated some controversy by calling his team "light years" ahead of everybody else in the NBA during the 2015-16 NBA season. The Warriors won championships in the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.
Personal life[edit]
Lacob has two sons, Kirk[16] and Kent.[17]

Early life[edit]
Lacob grew up in a Jewish family[4] in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father worked at a paper products company, his mother at a local supermarket. His favorite team in boyhood was the Boston Celtics of the NBA. When he was 14, the company that employed his father was sold. The only worker the new owners retained was his dad. The Lacob family relocated to Anaheim, California and Joe switched his allegiance to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[5][6]
Lacob earned a bachelor's degree in biological sciences from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), a master's in public health (epidemiology) from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[7] "I was a very poor kid," Lacob recalled. "Had nothing. I paid every dime of my education through college. Every single dime. I was the first person to graduate from college in the history of my family. Ever. I came from nothing."[5]

Joe Lacob
Owner & CEO









In his role as Owner & CEO, Joe Lacob is the managing member of the Golden State Warriors’ ownership group.  He serves on the NBA Board of Governors and is a member of the league’s Competition Committee, Planning Committee and Labor Committee. 
This past season, Lacob’s fifth as owner, the Warriors posted a franchise-best 67 wins during the regular season and captured the team’s first NBA Championship in 40 years. This marked the first time in 20 years, since the Houston Rockets in 1994 & 1995, that an ownership group had captured an NBA title within its first five years after taking control of the franchise.  The championship campaign culminated the most successful three-year run in Warriors history, as the club has posted 165 regular-season victories over the last three seasons and made three-straight playoff appearances for the first time since 1975-77.  In fact, prior to the last three seasons, the club had only made the playoffs once in the previous 18 years. 
The franchise’s success in recent years has also extended to the business side.  In 2014, the Warriors were named “Sports Team of the Year” by the Sports Business Journal/Daily, in recognition of the organization’s innovative and successful business practices.  Additionally, over the last year, the revamped Warriors Foundation has distributed over $1.5 million in grants (one of the top figures in the NBA) and more than 12,000 game tickets to deserving Bay Area organizations supporting youth development. 
Since making a then-record-setting bid to purchase his hometown NBA club – a longtime dream of the Atherton resident – and assuming control of the team on November 12, 2010, Lacob has been the driving force behind many of the creative changes that have transpired with the organization, including several major announcements, prominent personnel additions and an emphasis on transparency.  
In October 2015, the Warriors completed the purchase of 12 acres of land in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood, where the team intends to build a new state-of-the-art sports and entertainment center.  In addition to making monumental commitments to the team’s future, Lacob has taken an active role in connecting the current Warriors organization with its rich history.  In 2012, Lacob saw to it that one of the most beloved players in franchise history, Chris Mullin, received the honor of having his #17 jersey raised to the rafters at Oracle Arena, becoming the sixth player in franchise history to have his number retired. 
During his first full offseason as owner in the summer of 2011, Lacob recruited two of the most experienced, successful and respected individuals in NBA circles to join the organization, landing NBA Hall of Famer and basketball icon Jerry West as an executive board member, and hiring longtime league and team executive Rick Welts as president and chief operating officer.  Additionally, Lacob played a significant role in the hiring of successful sports agent Bob Myers, who is now the club’s general manager.  
Lacob’s NBA and professional sports experience dates back over two decades, including a five-year tenure as minority owner of the Boston Celtics, where he served on the basketball committee. He earned an NBA World Championship ring in 2008 with the storied franchise before selling his minority stake to purchase the Warriors. 
Lacob has been a partner of Menlo Park, California, based Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers since 1987. Though still a partner in the firm, he has relinquished his managing partner role in order to pursue his lifelong goal of owning and operating an NBA team. In his role as a venture capitalist, he has led investments in over 50 start-up companies across multiple fields in life sciences and medical technologies, the internet and energy. 
Lacob earned a Bachelor’s in Biological Sciences from the University of California-Irvine, a Master’s in Public Health (Epidemiology) from UCLA and an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He credits his Master’s degree in Epidemiology (biostatistics) with providing him a background in statistics that helped drive his passion for sports. It also played a role in his decision to invest in Sportsline – one of the first sports internet sites – and one of Lacob’s earliest sports success stories.  He was also a primary investor and pioneer of the American Basketball League, a professional women’s basketball league that eventually lost out to the WNBA.  Lacob continues as one of the original partners in the Pebble Beach Company, an effort formed to bring the historic Pebble Beach resort and golf course back to long-term American ownership.  Additionally, Lacob has been involved with Stanford basketball for over 25 years and is a fixture in his courtside seats at Maples Pavilion.  Lacob currently serves on the Board of Directors of one public company, Align Technology, as well as several other privately-held companies, including Neuropace, SunDrop Fuels, Imoji, and Athos, a wearable technology startup in athletic wear. 
In recent years, Lacob has been involved in industry organizations including the American Heart Association and the AHA Roundtable. He has also been very active at Stanford University, serving on advisory boards at the medical center, business school and athletic department. Lacob’s philanthropic interests focus on education, both in the community and with universities. He has also provided scholarships to a number of high potential academic and athletic high school and college students in need.  
An avid golfer, Joe has been a longtime participant in the AT&T National Pro-Am at Pebble Beach.  He has played in a regular pick-up basketball game, and still does, at least twice weekly for over 30 years at Stanford. Most importantly for Warriors fans, Lacob has been a passionate fan of the Bay Area club that he now owns – supporting his local franchise as a loyal and dedicated Season Ticket Holder since 1998.
