You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.

About Installing Citrix Receiver










Where can I download Citrix Receiver on other platforms and devices?







You can click to download the Receiver versions noted in this list of platforms and devices.


































Android (3.11.2)

























Chrome OS (2.5)

























iOS (7.2.2)



































Linux (13.5)

























Mac (12.6)

























Windows Desktop (4.8)


































Universal Windows Platform (1.0.2)

























Windows Phone (1.2.2)
























How do I install Receiver?







It’s easy. Click to view the step-by-step guide for the device or operating system you’re running. You will need set up information provided by your system administrator or IT help desk to complete the installation process.

















Android







Blackberry 10







Blackberry PlayBook
















iOS







Linux







Mac
















Windows Desktop







Windows 8/RT







Windows Phone























How do I get help installing or using Receiver?







Citrix Receiver requires a backend infrastructure to be correctly configured before you start using it. We recommend that you contact your system administrator or IT help desk. They have the necessary set up information required to resolve your questions.











I’m looking for the ICA Client. Is that the same as Receiver?







ICA is the extension of the configuration file that Receiver uses to connect to a Citrix-provided application or desktop. The ICA Client is an early version of Receiver. You use Receiver to centrally configure, manage, and update the technology, such as ICA, installed on the device.











I have a version of Receiver already installed. Do I need to uninstall previous versions?







Receiver automatically replaces many previous versions of Receiver and the Citrix online plug-ins, however, some versions must be removed manually before you can install the most recent version of Receiver. In that case, Receiver prompts you to remove the earlier versions from your device manually.











How do I get started after Receiver is installed?







In many cases, you open an appropriate URL in your browser to authenticate and use applications and virtual desktops. At times, you may need to configure your account by entering your email or a server address to authenticate with Receiver and use applications and virtual desktops. You can ask your system administrator for the steps to follow in your situation.











Where can I find previous versions of Receiver?







You can find earlier versions of Receiver on the Citrix Downloads website. Please confirm with your system administrator that you require an earlier version of Receiver before proceeding. Download current versions of Receiver using the links above.











Google Chrome asks me to download and install Citrix Receiver each time I access my apps. What’s happening?







Citrix recommends moving to the latest Receiver for Windows, Mac and StoreFront 3.0 to get the fix for this issue. The issue is that the default settings in Google Chrome have changed since April 2015. Please see this blog for workaround until you move to StoreFront 3.0 and latest Receivers to keep using Receiver with Chrome. Citrix Receiver continues to work as before with many alternative browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.











I’m a system administrator. How do I get help?







Support resources for system administrators are available on the Citrix Support website. Customers with a current technical support agreement can also open a support case with Citrix Support.











I am a system administrator. How do I upgrade my users from Receiver 3.4 to Receiver 4.4.1000 for Windows, and maintain app shortcuts?







You can now configure Receiver for Windows in “shortcut only” mode. This gives your users a seamless desktop experience with ready access to a core set of applications in a consistent way, automatically placing specific application and desktop shortcuts directly in the Start menu or on the desktop itself. Take a look at this Upgrade Guide for step-by-step instructions on completing the scripted-upgrade for all your users.











Will Receiver 12.6 for Mac work on my operating system?







Citrix Receiver for Mac currently supports the following operating systems:

Mac OS X 10.12

Mac OS X 10.11
Mac OS X 10.10
Mac OS X 10.9

Please note that Mac OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. For a full list of Receiver for Mac 12.0 system requirements, visit this page. To download earlier versions of Receiver, please visit the Citrix Downloads website.

Virtualize Skype for Business 







Over 100 million people are using Skype for Business to communicate for work. According to Microsoft, 79% of enterprise customers in the United States use or plan to use Skype for Business for telephony—and three out of four Citrix customers adopting unified communications have chosen Skype for Business.
Without proper consideration and design for optimization, virtual app and desktop users will very likely find the Microsoft Skype for Business experience to be subpar—but Citrix has the solution. XenApp and XenDesktop include the HDX RealTime Optimization Pack, developed with and endorsed by Microsoft, which allows you to publish Skype for Business as a virtualized application or within a virtual desktop—with the same performance as a local installation.
Read more about delivering Skype for Business with XenApp and XenDesktop











Enable virtual desktops on or offline







Citrix DesktopPlayer extends the benefits of XenDesktop to BYO and corporate laptop users, enabling them to run Windows virtual desktops on Windows or Mac devices whether they are online, offline, or over a slow and intermittent network connection. The type 2 client hypervisor features centralized management capabilities, including zero-touch provisioning, one-to-many patching, and role-based policy management for comprehensive IT control.
DesktopPlayer for Windows and Mac secures virtual computers and reduces the risk of data loss for on-the-go laptop users with features such as time-based lockout, expiration, and remote wipe policies. With these capabilities, sensitive information within the virtual desktop stays safe—even if the device is lost or stolen.

Accelerate workspace mobility with application layering







Application layering has emerged as the best way to separate apps from the underlying operating system, so they can be managed once and delivered from any end user computing solution to any device. Application compatibility is one of the most important criteria in realizing the value out of any layering solution.
Citrix App Layering offers full-stack layering technology. This enhances compatibility by layering the entire Windows workspace as modular virtual disks, including the Windows operating system itself (OS layer), apps (app layers), and a writable persistent layer that captures all user settings, apps, and data. Leverage the most scalable and feature-rich app-layering solution that simplifies the transition to the cloud, with the need to only manage a single app image across both on-premises and cloud-based deployments.

Deliver secure Linux virtual desktops and apps







Today’s mobile workforce has increased demand for secure access to mission-critical, high-performing Linux apps and desktops from any device. These Linux resources are essential to many industries, such as those conducting research and development work on chip design, numerical computation for financial and scientific modeling, or providing proprietary Linux-only apps to their engineers and developers.
XenApp and XenDesktop give users secure access to mission-critical, specialized Linux desktops from non-Linux devices. IT administrators can manage both Windows and Linux applications and desktops using a single console to reduce complexity and increase ROI of infrastructure investment by avoiding the need to purchase new hardware.

Centrally deliver graphics-intensive 3D apps







Design and manufacturing companies are embracing a new approach to IT. Instead of installing CAD applications on costly high-end workstations, they are moving desktops, apps and data to the datacenter and cloud providers, where they can be securely accessed on-demand by users anywhere. Apps and desktops run centrally on either virtual or physical machines freeing people to work on any device they choose—even a tablet. Network optimizations ensure an experience that looks, feels and acts like a traditional high-end PC no matter what the access type.
The most complete and effective virtualization solution for 3D apps comes from Citrix, the longtime leader in virtualization and mobile workstyles. Accessible on any device, the solution provides compression and graphics acceleration technologies to optimize professional 3D graphics apps over low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. Designed for seamless integration and proven in demanding production environments, the Citrix solution combines high performance with simplicity and manageability unmatched by point solutions or piecemeal strategies.

Deliver secure access to web and SaaS apps in any browser







Web-based apps are now a common part of many organizations’ IT strategy, but web browsers can cause many of the same headaches as any Windows app—from compatibility issues to frequent updates. To ease the delivery of specific browser-based apps to user, regardless of their chosen browser, Citrix offers Secure Browser. Secure Browser is a virtual browser that enables IT to deliver secure remote access to web and SaaS applications with zero endpoint configuration.
Secure Browser lets users choose any browser without the need for IT to test every type, version or plugin. This is especially significant as a broader range of devices enter the workplace, including mobile devices equipped with native browsers that often break web apps.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.
