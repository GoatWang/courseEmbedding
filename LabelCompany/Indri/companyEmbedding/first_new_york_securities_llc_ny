Most people don’t know what really goes on behind closed doors at a proprietary trading firm. So, we went to premier shop First New York Securities to get some answers about the business and what they look for in prospective hires …
Damien Hoffman: Gentlemen, what exactly does First New York do?
Joe Schenk: Contrary to popular belief, our business is proprietary trading not day trading.  Though we may trade intra-day, we are not day traders.
Our core business is a long-short equity book which is both domestic and international. We trade commodities and macro vehicles such as global interest rates, global FOREX, and Treasuries. We trade fixed income both taxable and tax exempt. We also get diversification by having approximately 250 or so independent decision makers.
Damien: Tell me more about those decision makers. How do you determine who will thrive in your firm?
Donald Motschwiller: The type of talent we generally look for are people spinning out of a bulge bracket banking firm or hedge fund.  The people that make the most amount of sense for us are discretionary traders.  Our definition of a discretionary trader is somebody who sources his ideas, sizes his ideas, executes his ideas, manages the risk of his ideas, and most importantly has been paid for his ideas.
When we look for new traders, we look for people that bring to the table another view, another skill set, another style, another strategy. We have an enormous amount of diversification at our firm. We don’t deploy a firm-wide strategy.  We don’t have group think.
We also look for people who have a repeatable strategy with good historical returns and scalability so we can add size. And, again, our business is a bottom line business, so the strategy has to be profitable.
So, we are not a healthcare fund or a tech fund.  We do not run a balance sheet intensive fund or strategy.
Liquidity drives our business. We need to know, “Is the product exchange traded? Is the product liquid?” All the products must be marked so we can get an accurate profit-and-loss statement. We want the ability to get out of our inventory in a relatively short period of time without impacting the market place or impacting our own portfolio.
Joe Schenk and Donald Motschwiller
Damien: Do you like to see experience on a resume before letting a new trader put a piece of your book at risk?
Joe: The biggest form of risk management in the firm is the fact that we trade only our own capital. So, we don’t have public or private money — we just have our own money. However, our model is a no-money-up model. Unlike many other prop shops, traders don’t have their capital at risk.
While interviewing prospects, we like to ask, “Where did you trade and how did you trade?”  We like to see people trading their own money.  I’m not saying the guys at bulge bracket banking firms or hedge funds are coy and cavalier about somebody else’s money.  But, perhaps we might trade our money and our family’s money a little bit differently than somebody else’s money.
Damien: That seems very psychological. Is there a psychological profile that one needs to have or can successful trading be taught?
Joe:  	There’s a lot of correlation between successful traders and athletes.  A trader does better when they’ve been under pressure and could live with his or her performance. If I were to guess how many of our traders were better than average athletes, I would say it’s a pretty high percentage.
Donald Motschwiller:  	It’s part of the commercial DNA we look for.  If there was a guy who was an athlete in college in a very competitive environment which positively and negatively reinforced his actions, and if he can take the negative reinforcement and return the next day looking to be better, that person has what it takes to do well as a trader. It takes a certain kind of candidate who is able to recognize that it’s a bottom-line business and thrive on a daily basis.
In our business there is nowhere to hide.  So, if Damien is a trader here, everyday Damien knows what he made or what he lost.  Everyday the firm knows what Damien made or what Damien lost.  You can’t hide on the desk if the desk does well but you’re doing poorly.  It’s not as if you’re working at a hedge fund or a banking firm where you’re reporting numbers on a monthly basis while intra-month you’re not doing well.
There’s also no netting risk. So, if Damien is trading and Donald is trading and Donald messes up, it doesn’t impact Damien’s ability to get paid. So in many instances, at other shops a stellar performer’s pay may be mitigated by another sector or somebody else having a more challenging time.
Joe: A successful trader must also have a passion for the market. Then we look at academics and experiences. We like people that have good strong mathematical skills. We rely heavily upon our interviewing process which in many instances are four to five separate individuals that challenge the new person on a wide variety of professional and personal experiences.
Donald: The biggest difference between people who have success in our field versus those who have less success is the ability to take risk.
The first time you trade, you react to a script. If the stock makes a certain move over the course of the day, if you’re reacting to what has already happened you’re going to capture a very small percentage of that move. As you get better, you start anticipating. When you start anticipating you start capturing a larger percentage of that move.
But the guys who truly trade the markets the best — the most talented guys in the firm — they trade the markets intuitively. They’ve seen it so many times and are so confident in the decision making process that they’re not reacting. They’re not anticipating. They’re just intuitively going about their business.
Damien:  	Does that lead to a Darwinian natural selection where you guys are constantly bringing in new talent and replacing talent that can’t necessarily cut it on that level of the game?
Donald:  	If the trader is as advertised, I believe we are the best place on planet Earth for that person. Over the past few years the talent pool has become much better. So we have been upgrading the talent.
The turnover we experience is more an issue of guys coming in and just not being as advertised.  I don’t recall instances when people left the firm because they weren’t given enough money to run or they weren’t making a reasonable amount of money.
The trader here is paid in cash, not in deferred comp or toxic assets.  Here, the trader gets a formulaic way of getting paid — so there’s no subjectivity of what he’s going to make.
Therefore, this is a very entrepreneurial shop. If you’re somebody who is accustomed to and ready to stand by your performance, this is a great place to be. If your part of a big conglomerate and your department is up a couple of million, but you’re down three and you still get paid, that’s a whole different thing philosophically.  This is definitely a place for entrepreneurs who have a lot of confidence in their ability. It’s a pure meritocracy.
Damien: Back tracking a tad, how did you make the decision that traders would not use their own money?
Donald:  	Over the past five years, there have been dynamic changes in market place.  We believe capital gives us staying power.  And in order for the firm to really be profitable, it has to have an economic model that gives the trader as well as the firm an opportunity to profit.
So, we have a platform of seeding propriety traders.  Our platform provides clearance, execution, technology, and capital.  And you as a proprietary trader will come in here and bolt your business model onto our platform.
In money-up models there is far less control the firm can have on the trader because the trader is going to take the perspective, “It’s my money and I’m going to do what I want with my money. Since you don’t have the risk, who are you to jiggle me out of positions when the market is going against me.”
Also, generally, in the money-up model most of the traders and firms are thinly capitalized.  And I would say our competitive advantage in the market place is the fact we are substantially capitalized.
Damien: Does that imply individual retail traders are at a disadvantage?
Donald:  	It’s more and more difficult to make money as a day trader.  I still think there’s plenty of opportunity for event-driven, catalyst-driven, short-term swing type of traders.  But the high-volume, low-margin day trader … that business is more and more challenging because that’s what the computers do. And the computers can think, move, react, and anticipate much quicker than an individual.
Plus access to information has become much more commoditized. Thus, it’s more difficult for the individual to get a leg up on the pros.
Damien: Well, Don and Joe, thanks for giving us a glimpse into the inner workings of a premier prop shop on Wall Street.
Don and Joe: Our pleasure.

CEO quit

                              
                              the ceo quit and there are rumors the firm is not doing too well. If you can get a paid gig there, go for it but I would think twice before investing with them given the circumstances.

solid reputation

                              
                              You train to be more of a research assistant/trader's bitch, but they are pretty selective. They do pay a base salary for SOME POSITIONS, which is more of an analyst type position than an actual trader.If you are willing to take risk to be independent and earn your income on your own, first NY is not the place to go. You'd be better off going with Broad St, CY Group, Capital Traders Group, or somewhere similar that offers free training. If you need the security of a base salary, First New York is a great firm to start at. I'll give a quick disclaimer. I interviewed here but I was looking for rates and BP for a new account, not for a job.

Reputable

                              
                              They have the best reputation of any prop firm.  If you have no experience, their training program takes about 2 years, and they pay you a pretty good salary.  It could be frustating not being able to trade for that long, but they are making an investment in you instead of just encouraging you to churn your account like most prop firms.

ultra high quality prop firm

                              
                              There is a reason this firm only accepts top-10 business school graduates and similarly qualified people. I have heard their program is top-tier and worth the long application process. Definitely a firm to consider strongly if you have the credentials to apply.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.





Will I have the option to act as my own Registered Agent?

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.
