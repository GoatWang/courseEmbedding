This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Keenly priced with a couple of good actives but kojic acid may irritate sensitive skin


Salma Hayek’s much anticipated skincare line, Nuance, has finally been launched and, naturally, I immediately bought the nothing if not affordable Renewing and Brightening Facial Serum ($19.99 for 1oz at CVS) and tried it out for the first time over the weekend.  The 44-year old actress says that the line is inspired by her grandmother and the Facial Serum makes a big feature out of licorice. Before Salma Hayek’s line was launched there was a flurry of speculation that the star of the show would be something called concha nacar (mother of pearl) and that the actress would be using it to make a “lightening cream”. But now that the Nuance serum has debuted, it doesn’t even have a bit part.  In fact, the lightening role looks to be the job of a stable form of kojic acid (the third ingredient listed - aminopropyl kojyl phosphate). Now kojic acid, typically used as a skin whitener, is somewhat controversial and is certainly a strong irritant or sensitizer. In 2008, the European Union concluded that “data support the conclusion, that skin penetration in rats and humans is considerable” and that “the use of kojic acid at a maximum concentration of 1.0% in skin care formulations poses a risk to the health of the consumer.”  So at less than 1%, kojic acid may be relatively safe. However, the industry body, CIR says that at less than 1%, while safe, skin lightening wouldn’t be seen. I don’t know what the concentration is in Nuance, but I would assume that it is 1% or less. That’s good, but then am I to have low expectations for this product to work?  Despite my misgivings about kojic acid, I’m giving Nuance a try out on my neck. My skin seems a bit reaction-prone right now, so I am taking a cautious approach in case this serum irritates me.  Although the most dominant ingredient after water is unimpressively a thickening agent, pentaerythrityl tetraisostearate, I found the consistency of the Nuance Facial Serum to be a little on the thin side. Nor does it absorb very well, which tends to make the metal roller with which it is applied a bit redundant since I resorted to rubbing it in with my fingers.  There are a good number of decent botanicals in Nuance. I especially like omega 7 rich macadamia and mimosa (albizzia julibrissin) seems to have exciting possibilities as a free radical scavenger that is more potent than L-ascorbic acid. Probably the most impressive track record is held by cactus pear (opuntia), a cancer fighter that deploys an array of different antioxidants. Nuance also contains blue agave extract, but I’ve never been able to find much justification for its role in skincare. Licorice is supposed to play a key role in Nuance's serum and it is certainly an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, although less convincing as a skin lightener.  Another interesting inclusion is hexanoyl dipeptide-3 (which is lecithin and norleucine acetate) activates skin cell regeneration by stimulating the natural desquamation process of the skin, leading to a gentle peeling.  There are, of course, the usual suspects in the preservative department (sodium hydroxide and phenoxyethanol) and undisclosed fragrance. The above mentioned thickener emollient (pentaerythrityl tetraisostearate) has way too big a role. But that may be how the price of Nuance Facial Serum is kept at such a keen level. And for something that is under twenty bucks, I think the formulation is, on the face of it, pretty good. Now I just hope that my skin can cope with the kojic acid. I’ll report back in a while.

Can't find this product in the store or online anymore. Has it been discontinued? I love washing my face with it!!! What happened to it?

I am on first name bases with a dermatologist!  Frequent visits and expensive purchases resulted in this familiarity...I recently tried Nuance when it was on sale!

I can not believe the difference it has made in my complexion. The "Rosacea Redness" is completely gone..Truth!!!  The product is so much more reasonable than the dermatologist's products...I am so pleased and the product feels so refreshing!

I am radiant....

I am THRILLED.  After years of trying product after product with little in the result departments, I am THRILLED with the Nuance line.  This morning I noticed for the first time how much smoother my face is, how much the lines in my face and neck have been diminished.  Better still is an overall tightening of my skin.  I am a Nuance user for life.

I love her line omg I brought the facial gel with green tea extract and my skin felt great! I think her and her billionare truly invested some serious money to get this product right. I also use chanel and kheils but am adding if few if her products to my regimen in love!

This is to Salma:  I have been meaning to contact you for awhile.  I am a user of your Nuance product line, in particular, the cheek trio (Mauve).  Without fail, when ever I venture out, I receive so many compliments on my skin!!! Just out of the clear blue, people will walk up to me and tell me how beautiful my skin is! This product is luminiscent, and my skin looks healthy! (Even my Oncology doc is amazed!) I tell them it is the product I use.  One gal wanted to know if I could make her look as good as me.  It has been hard to find your products (in particular at CVS), I was afraid your line did not make it.  I bought a couple more products to try.  Your product has blessed me, for you see, I have terminal cancer.  No hair, (I wear caps - no wigs) no eylashes and no eyebrows!! So to have people tell me I have pretty skin, or compliment me, has really helped my state of mind.  I think this has a lot to do with my attitude with healing.  Even though I have baffled the docs with how I look, God and I will decide when it is time for me to go!! Thank you!!!  Love and Hugs!

I love her products especially since it is hard to find a paraben free and natural product that works! The moisturizer is a little creamy just use a little that is enough. Her makeup is great too love her lipstick! I am addicted to the packaging, smell and how it works! Please buy her products I need it to stay in stores!

I rarely rave about a product. I am raving. I love the AM/PM cream, and the Anti-Aging Eye Cream. I have not tried any of the other products, but love that these are obtainable locally, are affordable, and bring results! I will be 60, this August of 2012, and really am quite impressed, to say the least!

I picked up a trial size tube of the Curl Cream for my daughter's curly hair and allergy to man-made perfumes.  The cream is beyond amazing; how it smells, how it works, the cost... I'm sure there are other wonderful products in department stores for loads.  I love everything in the hair care line.  Now that I've found other people who've tried the skin care products, I'll be trying those out too.  For the cost, I love the products.

I find it beyond amazing, and confounding, that celebrities with the resources- not only financial, but say putting an assistant to work researching skincare and finding products and sites to obtain knowledge (textbook, critical knowledge, maybe not for themselves to knock around, but for the team who is going to put the product together) when they want to take the plunge themselves into this industry.

As you've cited, Marta, Salma's products isn't "bad," and my guess is she's aiming at the drugstore market who can't afford more. For this purpose I think she's probably offered an acceptable product... awaiting your approval. There are concerns, and I do trust your judgement.

My arguement here is celebrities on whole seem so clueless. It's my impression they will see a $500 price tag and believe that means they MUST be purchasing a select and dependable product. What I wouldn't give if TIA could reach in and help even more... more... ~jk

5 Products Worth Trying from Nuance by Salma Hayek

When it comes to celebrity beauty lines, consider me a natural skeptic. I mean, besides their name, what value is a singer/model/actress really going to add when it comes to formulating effective products? That said, a few celebrities have proven me wrong. I adore Drew Barrymore’s Flower cosmetics, have splurged on Josie Maran’s namesake skincare products, and now, I find myself obsessing over Salma Hayek’s Nuance line, available exclusively at CVS. In preparation for this post, I spent months testing and retesting 30+ products from Hayek’s collection. Here are the ones that came out on top:
Green Tea Cooling Eye Gel ($17): My three-word review? It actually works! As an allergy-sufferer with chronic insomnia, I’ve tried more drugstore eye creams than I’d ever care to admit, and more often than not, they do absolutely diddley squat. This fast-absorbing gel de-puffs eyes instantly and effectively, especially when stashed in the fridge in between uses.
My Secret Super Brightening Hand Cream ($10): Hayek’s ultra-rich hand cream reminds me of something my grandma would have on her nightstand, and I mean that in the best possible way. The formula is incredibly moisturizing but doesn’t feel greasy, and I’m so gaga over its lightly nostalgic floral scent I keep a tube at home and at work.
White Clay Ageless Clarity White Clay Treatment Mask ($13): In warmer months, clay masks work their way into my weekly rotation, and Hayek’s radiance-boosting iteration has quickly become a favorite. Fortified with tepezcohuite, an ingredient prized by the ancient Mayans for its anti-microbial and regenerative properties, and tempered with calming calendula, this mask sloughs away dead, dull skin and absorbs excess grease without irritation or over-drying.
Cucumber & Rosewater Dual Phase Makeup Remover ($8):  Occasionally I buy beauty products simply because they’re pretty to look at, a habit that often leaves me disappointed. The purchase of this pretty layered eye makeup remover was not one of those instances. Packed with nourishing botanical extracts, including a few standards (cucumber, rosewater, lavender) along with some newbies (blue agave, camapu, mimosa and prickly pear), this product is easy on the eyes, in more ways than one. Good thing it’s pretty to look at because one bottle lasts for MONTHS.
Rose Petal Hydrating Balm ($15): This past winter, I had a cold that lasted months. After blow no. 4,994,225, my poor nose needed major TLC. I tried Vaseline, Neosporin, vitamin E and coconut oil—all to no avail. Desperate for relief, I dabbed a bit of this balm on at bedtime with zero expectations. When I woke up, my chapped, split nostrils were healed! Since then, I’ve considered this rosy balm something of a miracle-worker, and have used it on everything from torn cuticles to curling iron burns to bug bites.

THESE HAPPENED, TOO

I see her products whenever I go to CVS and have been curious about them. Great reviews, especially when you mentioned key ingredients in each product.

Love this post! I use the Nuance serum, daytime moisturizer & the nighttime cream as well. In love with these products.  Can’t wait to add your recommendations to my Nuance collection.

I’ve been on the lookout for a cheaper eye makeup remover (I’m running low on my trusted Lancome one!) so I might just try this one out! Thanks for the review 🙂 Can you also do one one Vain Pursuits? I’d love to hear what you have to say about them!

I’ve been wanting to try Salma’s line but like you I am skeptical about celebrity beauty lines. I can’t wait to try out these products.  Thanks for the review.

Nuance retinal capsules are a must have. 28 capsules in a bottle. 25 dollars a bottle and works far better than a 300 dollar bottle of another brand. Goes on like silk. This stuff is AMAZING!!!  It’s definitely a must have!

I purchased the sea salt spray.  First I was going to put it into a gift bag for velentines day for my granddaughter.  Then I just though I’d try it on my fine thin hair. Amazing! I’m sold on this product now I’m stressing that like so many hair products it will be discontinued.  My intention is to go on amazon and purchase about 5 bottles.  I’ve stewed and stressed over fine thin hair for 5 years.  I lost all my hair during chemo treatments and just felt like I looked so old.  Now I feel almost pretty once again ! Thank you.
