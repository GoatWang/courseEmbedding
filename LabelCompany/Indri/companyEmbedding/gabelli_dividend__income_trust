Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.  You can obtain more information about the Fund by calling 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554). The Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Stocks are subject to market, economic, and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investors acquire shares of the Fund on a securities exchange at market value, which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand.  Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.
