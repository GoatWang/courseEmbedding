Daniel R. Hesse 

















Former President and CEO of Sprint Corporation 




Daniel R. Hesse joined Akamai as a director in August 2016. As a veteran telecommunications and Internet executive, Hesse served as President and CEO of Sprint Corporation from December 2007 to August 2014. 


Previously, Mr. Hesse served as Chairman and CEO of Embarq Corporation, a $6 billion telecommunications services company, and he was Chairman, President and CEO of Terabeam Corporation, a wireless telecommunications technology company. Hesse spent over two decades at AT&T, having led AT&T’s Online Services Group and the launch of the company’s first Internet service, WorldNet, and served as President and CEO of AT&T Wireless Services, the United States’ largest wireless carrier at the time. 


In addition to receiving Corporate Responsibility magazine’s Lifetime Achievement Award, Mr. Hesse has been named “Most Influential Person in Mobile Technology” by LAPTOP magazine, Wireless Industry “Person of the Year” by RCR magazine, “Executive of the Year” by Wireless Business and Technology magazine, “CEO of the Year” by the National Eagle Leadership Institute, one of the five “Best Turnaround CEO’s of All Time” by Fierce Wireless, one of “10 Inspirational Leaders who Turned Around Their Companies” by Entrepreneur magazine, and he has twice received Wireless Week magazine’s Leadership Award.

For Mr. Hesse’s last two full calendar years as CEO, Sprint’s Total Shareholder Return (assuming reinvested dividends) ranked #1 among all S&P 500 companies. 


Mr. Hesse serves on the National Board of Governors of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and on the board of PNC. He has been awarded a CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

Early life[edit]
Hesse's father was a career army officer and he spent his early years going from army base to army base attending 8 different schools between kindergarten in Italy before graduating Stuttgart American High School.
He received a Bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame in government and liberal studies in 1975;[2] an MBA from the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University in 1977; and master's of science from the MIT Sloan School of Management as a Sloan Fellow in 1989.
In telecommunications[edit]
AT&T[edit]
He spent 23 years at AT&T where he started out as an intern.
From 1991–1995 he was President and CEO of AT&T Network Systems International based in the Netherlands.
He launched the online division's AT&T Worldnet service in February 1996 which introduced unlimited internet dial up for $20/month as long as you subscribed to AT&T's long distance services.[3]
In May 1997 he became head of AT&T Wireless.[3]
Terabeam Corporation[edit]
From March 2000 to June 2004 he was CEO and chairman of Terabeam Corporation.[4]

During his tenure he appeared in numerous television commercials for the company, filmed in black and white, and created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. The ads were filmed in New York City.
When Hesse took over at Sprint, the company was losing numerous customers. His strategy to stem further losses included improved customer service, an increased emphasis on prepaid cell phones, striking a deal with Apple to sell iPhones and other Apple products, and a 4G presence investment/ownership stake in WiMAX-provider Clearwire. He also started adding retail stores across the nation in an attempt for increased in-person customer service.
On August 6, 2014 Sprint announced that Hesse would be replaced by Marcelo Claure, founder of Brightstar Corporation.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Dan Hesse took a year off of work following him leaving Sprint.[7]

From 1991–1995 he was President and CEO of AT&T Network Systems International based in the Netherlands.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Hermann HesseHermann Hesse Born July 2nd 1877 in Calw, Württemberg, Germany. He was a profound poet, novelist and painter. His parents were Johannes and Marie Hesse who both served under the Protestant Christian Missionary society. His most famous works consist of fictious novels, in which discover a man's inner-self spiritually. They are...-Siddartha -Steppenwolf-The Glass Bead Game-Demian  He received the Nobel Prize in 1946 in literature, for humanitarian ideals and high quality style. In this website they wrote that Hermann won the prize"for his inspired writings which, while growing in boldness and penetration, exemplify the classical humanitarian ideals and high qualities of style". (http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1946/) -“Lying In Grass by Hermann HesseIs this everything now, the quick delusions of flowers,And the down colors of the bright summer meadow,The soft blue spread of heaven, the bees' song,Is this everything only a god'sGroaning dream,The cry of unconscious powers for deliverance?The distant line of the mountain,That beautifully and courageously rests in the blue,Is this too only a convulsion,Only the wild strain of fermenting nature,Only grief, only agony, only meaningless fumbling,Never resting, never a blessed movement?No! Leave me alone, you impure dreamOf the world in suffering!The dance of tiny insects cradles you in an evening radiance,The bird's cry cradles you,A breath of wind cools my foreheadWith consolation.Leave me alone, you unendurably old human grief!Let it all be pain.Let it all be suffering, let it be wretched-But not this one sweet hour in the summer,And not the fragrance of the red clover,And not the deep tender pleasureIn my soul.” "The novel attracted especially young veterans of the WW I, and reflected Hesse's personal crisis and interest in Jungian psychoanalysis. With Aldous Huxley he shared belief in the need for spiritual self-realization. "There is no reality except the one contained within us," Hesse once said. "That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself." Hesse later admitted that Demian was a story of "individuation" in the Jungian manner. (http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm) Steppenwolf Plot Summary"It is a discourse of a man who believes himself to be of two natures: one high, the spiritual nature of man; while the other is low, animalistic; a "wolf of the steppes". This man is entangled in an irresolvable struggle, never content with either nature because he cannot see beyond this self-made concept."(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(novel)#Plot_summary) Siddartha Plot Summary""The story begins as Siddhartha, the son of a Brahmin, leaves his home to join the ascetics with his companion Govinda. The two set out in the search of enlightenment.Siddhartha goes from asceticism, to a very worldly life as a trader with a lover, and back to asceticism as he attempts to achieve this goal.The story takes place in ancient India around the time of Gautama Buddha (likely between the fourth and seventh centuries BC[2])."(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)#Film_versions) The Glass Bead Game Plot Summary"The Glass Bead Game takes place at an unspecified date, centuries into the future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book's narrator writing around the start of the 25th century. The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called Castalia, reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to nurture and play the Glass Bead Game, whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school within Castalia known as Waldzell. The rules of the game are only alluded to, and are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine. Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music, mathematics, and cultural history. Essentially the game is an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics."(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game) Demian Plot Summary"Emil Sinclair is a young boy raised in a bourgeois home, amidst what is described as a Scheinwelt, a play on words that means "world of light" as well as "world of illusion". Emil's entire existence can be summarized as a struggle between two worlds: the show world of illusion (related to the Hindu concept of maya) and the real world, the world of spiritual truth. In the course of the novel, accompanied and prompted by his mysterious classmate 'Max Demian', he detaches from and revolts against the superficial ideals of the world of appearances and eventually awakens into a realization of self."(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demian) Hermann Hesse is an important person to the 20th century because he explores the journey to understanding life, and reaching the ultimate goal in the human condition. He is an intelligent person who discovers and expresses the meaning of life through ficticious characters in his novels.  Works Cited"Demian." Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia.
