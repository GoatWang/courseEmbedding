We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

S Corps provide personal asset protection, which shields you from being personally liable for business debts. Owners have no personal asset protection, which makes them personally liable for business debts. Managing Your Business Flexibility in management      LLCs must be member or manager managed according to the terms of the operating agreement. Member managed means the owners of the company manage the company. Manager-managed means the members (or owners) elect one or more managers to manage the company. C Corps are required to have shareholder elected directors who oversee and elect officers to run the day-to-day operations of the company. The business owner(s) can be the shareholder(s), the director(s) and officer(s). S Corps are required to have shareholder elected directors who oversee and elect officers to run the day-to-day operations of the company.

Nonprofits are managed by their board of directors following the regulations set forth in their Bylaws. Ease of ownership changes Varies     Changes in ownership of an LLC are dependent on the terms of the operating agreement. Ownership changes in a C Corp are easily made through the sell of stock to new or existing shareholders. Ownership changes in an S Corp are easily made through the sell of stock to new or existing shareholders. DBAs cannot make ownership changes. Perpetual existence Varies     The life of the LLC is dependent of the terms of the operating agreement. Its existence may be short term or perpetual that survive the death or transfer of the membership interests of the original founders. C Corps are separate entities that survive the death or transfer of stock of the owners and/or major shareholders. S Corps are separate entities that survive the death or transfer of stock of the owners and/or major shareholders. DBAs end upon closure of the company or the death of the owner. Nonprofits are entities that survive any change in their board of directors. Ongoing formalities      Depending on the state of incorporation, an LLC may be required to file an annual report and/or pay franchise fees. After formation, C Corps have many ongoing formalities such as writing bylaws, selecting directors, holding initial and annual shareholder meetings, and issuing stock. After formation, S Corps have many ongoing formalities such as writing bylaws, selecting directors, holding initial and annual shareholder meetings, and issuing stock. There are no ongoing corporate formalities.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.
