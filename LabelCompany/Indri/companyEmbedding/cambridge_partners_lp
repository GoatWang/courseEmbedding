We welcome the opportunity to put our expertise and experience to work for you and look forward to hearing from you.
Up-to-Date Appraisal
Markets are constantly fluctuating or changing. These fluctuations affect various properties differently. Because of this constant state of flux, there is no all-inclusive answer as to how long an appraisal may be considered up-to-date. Whether an appraisal needs to be updated depends on any changes that have occurred in the assets that were already under appraisement and whether the value and premise of value at the time of that appraisal are still pertinent. We recommend that an appraisal be reviewed and updated as required at least every year. If the business, asset or market conditions have changed dramatically, a review may be required sooner.

FLP Appraisal and LLC Discount Study Valuations: Appraisals of family limited partnership interests, LLC member interests, discounts for lack of control and marketability (DLOM and DLOC), fractional equity interests




















Home

About Us

Contact Us

Sitemap


















A Discount Study is a form of valuation that is generally performed to determine the value of a non-controlling equity interest (minority interest). The discount study will also address  whether an absence of a market to sell the shares warrants additional discounts to the stock's value (marketability).





Lack of  Control and Lack of Marketability Issues affecting valuation
When compared with the  value of a majority interest in a public company, the value of a minority  interest in a privately held company is negatively impacted by both  marketability and control issues. 
Marketability is defined in the International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms as “the ability to quickly convert property to cash at minimal cost”. A Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM) is “an amount or percentage deducted from the value of an ownership interest to reflect the relative absence of marketability".
Given two identical business interests, a higher price will be paid by investors in the market for the business interest that can be converted to cash most rapidly, without risk of loss in value. An example is publicly-traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, where the owner can order the sale and the proceeds are deposited in a bank account in three days.
In the alternative, a lesser price is expected for the business interest that cannot
                  be quickly sold and converted to cash. A primary concern driving this price 
                  reduction is that, over the uncertain time frame required to complete the sale, the 
                  final sale price becomes less certain and with it a decline in value is quite 
                  possible. Accordingly, a prudent buyer would want a discount for acquiring such 
                an interest to protect against value loss in a future sale scenario.
The Business Valuation Committee of the American Society of Appraisers states a discount for lack of control represents “an amount or percentage deducted from a pro-rata share of the value of 100 percent of an equity interest in a business, to reflect the absence of some or all of the powers of control.” The discount for lack of control is synonymous with the minority interest discount. As cited in the third edition of Valuing a Business, by Pratt, Reilly and Schweis: The lack of control (minority interest) discount is attributable to the fact that a holder of a Member Interest generally does not have the power to: 

Appoint or change operational management or members of the board of  directors
Determine management compensation and  perquisites
Set operational and strategic policy and change  the course of business
Acquire, lease, or liquidate assets, including  plant property and equipment
Select suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors  with whom to do business and award contracts
Negotiate and consummate mergers and  acquisitions, select joint venturers, and enter into joint  venture and partnership agreements
Liquidate, dissolve, sell out, or recapitalize  the company
Sell or acquire treasury shares
Register the company’s equity or debt securities for  initial or secondary public offering
Declare and pay cash and/or stock dividends
Change the articles of incorporation or bylaws
Set one’s own compensation (and perquisites) and  the compensation (and perquisites) of related-party employee
Decide what products and/or services to offer  and how to price those products/services
Decide which customer categories to market to  and which not to market to
Enter into inbound and outbound license or  sharing agreements regarding intellectual properties
Block any or all of the above actions 

In the context of valuation of minority or fractional ownership interests in FLP and LLC partnerships, does appraising family limited partnership interests differ from appraising a business?
Yes. Because the stock of many businesses are owned by individuals who form partnerships, the value of a majority or minority interest in the underlying partnership assets are affected. Among other variables that affect the partnerships value are: size of the interest being appraised, restrictions laid out in the family limited partnership or LLC operating agreement, the historical dividends paid (and expected future dividend paying capacity of the entity), the historical profitability of the partnership, the future outlook of the enterprise, the net asset value of the underlying assets, etc.
Cambridge Partners appraises fractional ownership interests and partnership interests for a variety of purposes, including: trust and estate planning, IRS Form 706 returns, gifting, divorce, for buy/sell agreements, joint venture contribution, calculation of the minority interest for rollover equity, etc.
 


FAIR MARKET VALUE
In performing a discount study valuation of an LLC member interest or FLP partnership interest, a Fair Market Value appraisal must consider the factors listed in Internal Revenue Service Rev. Rul. 59-60 which specifically includes:

The nature of the business and the history of the enterprise
The economic outlook in general and in particular the outlook for the specific industry of the business
The book value of the stock and the financial condition of the business
The earnings capacity of the business
Whether or not the business has goodwill or intangible value
Prior sales of stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued. The market prices of corporations that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the company being appraised, and whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, either on an exchange or over the counter
The dividend-paying capacity of the company being appraised

BRAINS AND BRAWN
                    Intangible assets or intellectual property are the “brainpower" that formulates the product or service to be produced whereas the tangible or physical assets are the "strength" that are actually involved in the product’s production. Intangible assets fall into four broad categories, they are: Market Related, Customer related, Contractual and Technology related intangibles.





How To Value Intangibles Assets and Intellectual Property 
Three primary approaches apply to the valuation of intangible assets: the Income approach, the Market Comparable approach, and the Cost approach. Numerous modifications of these approaches have been developed over the years. The value of an intangible may be based on using one or various combinations of these approaches.
Certain events trigger a need for  the valuation of Intangible Assets and Intellectual Property, for example:

An intangible asset and purchase price allocation appraisal should be performed when accounting for business combinations under ASC 805. GAAP and IFRS require the purchase price paid for a company  be properly allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. 
For a Transfer pricing study Asset Valuation (IRS Section 482) or royalty rate study which involves licensing of an intangible asset such as a trademark, patent or technology to related party companies.
An intangible asset valuation should be performed in order to comply with the goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing requirement of ASC 350.
An intangible asset valuation should be performed when contemplating a licensing arrangement of brands, trademark, technology or other proprietary assets.

Remaining Useful Life of Intangible Assets or Intellectual Property
For Fair Value financial reporting purposes, the remaining useful life determination of intangible assets is required. Estimating the useful life is important in determining the value. Generally the longer the life, the more valuable the intangible asset.
For IRS Federal income tax purposes, the remaining useful life determination of intangible assets and intellectual property is as important as the appraisal. The Internal Revenue Service allows for the amortization of intangible assets only when the taxpayer establishes that the assets have an ascertainable value separate and distinct from goodwill, and have a limited useful life whose duration can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. In order to prove that these intangible assets are wasting and have a reasonably determinable useful life, we perform an obsolescence, decay and lifing analysis.

INVESTOR BEWARE:	Cambridge fraud case spotlights risks in monitoring hedge funds - Pensions & Investments














































































































































































INVESTOR BEWARE:	Cambridge fraud case spotlights risks in monitoring hedge funds
 



      By Chris Clair
 · June 25, 2001



John C. Natale's name will forever be linked with hedge fund fraud. But in an ironic twist, Mr. Natale's name also is mentioned when it comes to hedge fund security.Mr. Natale, 46, of Long Branch, N.J., pleaded guilty in March 2000 to defrauding investors in his Red Bank, N.J.-based Cambridge Partners LP and Cambridge Partners II LP hedge funds of more than $40 million over eight years.However, he had a third, smaller hedge fund, which had less than $10 million in institutional fund-of-funds and wealthy individuals' money in it. Although Mr. Natale tried to transfer assets in that hedge fund to cover his losses in the two larger funds, a legal agreement he signed when he listed the smaller hedge fund on PlusFunds.com Ltd. prevented him from transferring money out of the PlusFunds account.

But the success Mr. Natale had siphoning off money from his hedge funds points to weaknesses in hedge fund monitoring, said Christopher C. Sugrue, chairman of PlusFunds Ltd., which runs the website. He said platforms such as PlusFunds, which list the net asset values and provide real-time risk reporting for various hedge funds, are one way investors can protect themselves.But of the thousands of hedge funds in existence, PlusFunds lists only 20, with a combined value of about $500 million, Mr. Sugrue said. It's really up to investors to protect themselves.Structure outgrown"In an industry with very low barriers to participation, and now 5,000 people providing product, a certain number of those will be frauds," Mr. Sugrue said. "The hedge fund business, in my opinion, has outgrown the structures that were initially sufficient to help it run and organize itself efficiently."In all, high-profile hedge fund fraud cost investors close to $1 billion in 2000, according to published reports.A number of pension funds, including the California Public Employees' Retirement System, Sacramento; BellSouth Corp., Atlanta; the State Board of Administration of Florida, Tallahassee; and the Oklahoma Firefighters' Pension & Retirement System, Oklahoma City, all are either considering hedge fund investments or have hired hedge fund managers.And when they look at hedge funds, they and other institutional investors might do well to keep Mr. Natale's story in mind.Between 1992, when he started the funds, and 1999, Mr. Natale gathered close to 180 investors in his Cambridge Partners and Cambridge Partners II hedge funds. His investment philosophy was to short Internet and technology stocks, believing the bull market would soon end. As stock prices fell, he reasoned, his fund - and its investors - would make big gains.But Internet and tech stocks continued to skyrocket, and Mr. Natale's investors instead lost huge sums of money - $20,000 within months of starting the funds, according to charges filed against Mr. Natale in New Jersey Superior Court in Newark.Ponzi schemeRather than let on to his investors, Mr. Natale admitted in court to using a Ponzi scheme to cover his tracks. He used new capital to cash out investors who left the funds and created false audits, tax documents and monthly statements to investors.Meanwhile, the hedge fund Mr. Natale had set up on the PlusFunds platform, which hedged large-cap domestic stocks and avoided tech stocks, was performing well. Aware of the success of the PlusFunds hedge fund, Mr. Natale tried taking money from that account and moving it to Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, New York, the prime broker overseeing the Cambridge hedge funds, to cover his larger losses in those funds, Mr. Sugrue said.For the PlusFunds hedge fund, Mr. Natale used the Bear Stearns Cos. Inc., New York, as prime broker.Hedge funds listed on the PlusFunds platform, are separate but parallel funds, Mr. Sugrue said. Everything can be the same as in the original hedge fund, but the manager agrees not to commingle the outside hedge fund money with the money in the PlusFunds fund. Also, any assets moved out of the PlusFunds hedge fund, except for client redemptions, must be put into a new PlusFunds account - barring Mr. Natale from accessing the PlusFunds hedge fund assets, Mr. Sugrue said.Finally, in mid-February 2000, after eight years of hiding losses, Mr. Natale broke down and turned himself in to the New Jersey Attorney General's office. On March 3, 2000, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud, theft by deception and misapplication of entrusted property. On Feb. 16 of this year, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Joseph Falcone sentenced Mr. Natale to 10 years in prison, barred him from working in the securities industry ever again and ordered him to pay $51 million in restitution. Mr. Natale is broke, however, so investors are unlikely to get their money back, said Emily J. Hornaday, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice.Fraud like that perpetrated by Mr. Natale and others is on the rise because more money is going into hedge funds and because hedge funds aren't closely regulated, said Thomas Fedorek, a managing director at the New York investigative firm Kroll Associates, which conducts due diligence for financial services firms, business intelligence, investigations and security.
