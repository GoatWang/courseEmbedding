About Fenimore







 

Terms of Use



	The following Terms of Use are for Fenimore Asset Management, Inc. (“FAM”), Fenimore Asset Management Trust (FAM Funds), FAM Shareholder Services, Inc. (“FSSI”), and Fenimore Securities, Inc. (“FSI”) — collectively “Fenimore.” Fenimore’s services described on our website are available only to persons in certain States within the United States. Nothing on our website shall be considered an offer of our investment advisory services, an offer or solicitation to buy, or an offer to sell a security to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction. In accordance with SEC requirements, non-U.S. investors may contact us for more information about Fenimore’s investment services and products available to them.

Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
	The information on this site is provided "AS IS". Fenimore does not warrant the accuracy of the materials provided herein, either expressly or impliedly, for any particular purpose and expressly disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Fenimore will not be responsible for any loss or damage that could result from interception by third parties of any information made available to you via this site. Although the information provided to you on this site is obtained or compiled from sources we believe to be reliable, Fenimore cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy, validity, timeliness or completeness of any information or data made available to you for any particular purpose. Neither Fenimore nor any of its directors, officers or employees, and third party vendors will be liable or have any responsibility of any kind for any loss or damage that you incur in the event of any failure or interruption of this site, or resulting from the act or omission of any other party involved in making this site or the data contained therein available to you, or from any other cause relating to your access to, inability to access, or use of the site or these materials, whether or not the circumstances giving rise to such cause may have been within the control of Fenimore or of any vendor providing software or services support. In no event will Fenimore or any such parties be liable to you for any direct, special, indirect, consequential, incidental damages or any other damages of any kind even if Fenimore or any other party have been advised of the possibility thereof.

USA Patriot Act
	In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the USA Patriot Act. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA Patriot Act requires all financial institutions, including mutual funds, to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For all new accounts, this means that the following information must be obtained: Name, Date of Birth, Physical Residential Address (post office boxes are permitted for mailing purposes only), and Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or passport in order to verify your identity.

	Until such verification is made, FAM Funds may be required to not open your account, close your account or take other steps we deem reasonable if we are unable to verify your identity and ensure that the information you supply is correct.

Fenimore Securities, Inc. Business Continuity Planning
	Fenimore Securities, Inc., a broker-dealer and distributor of the FAM Funds, has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, and in compliance with NASD Rule 3510, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.

Contacting Us
	If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at (800) 932-3271 you should call our alternative number firm emergency number at (518) 355-6340 or go to our web site at www.famfunds.com. FAM Shareholder Services, our service provider, will seek to continue to provide access to your account at FAM Funds.

Our Business Continuity Plan
	We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.

	Our business continuity plan addresses: data back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.

	Our service provider, FAM Shareholder Services, backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by FAM Shareholder Services that its objective is to restore its own operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new transactions and payments within 24 hours. Your transactions could be delayed during this period.

Varying Disruptions
	Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as the single building housing our firm, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to our firm, our city, or our region, we will seek to transfer our operations to our emergency site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within 24 hours. In each situation, we plan to continue in business and notify you through our web site www.famfunds.com or our customer emergency number, (518) 355-6340 on how to contact us.

FAM Funds
	While Fenimore Securities and FAM Shareholder Services plan to resume business as expeditiously as possible, should a significant business disruption occur such that FAM Funds does not calculate its net asset value (e.g., a disruption that affects trading on the NYSE or Nasdaq), your transaction may be delayed until such time as the net asset value is next calculated.

For More Information
	Any material changes to the above information will be available on our website or upon request. If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at (800) 932-3271.

Use of Links
	Should the viewer leave this site via a link contained herein, and view content that is not provided by Fenimore the viewer does so at its own risk. The content to which you link will not have been developed, checked for accuracy, or otherwise reviewed by Fenimore.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent.

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
