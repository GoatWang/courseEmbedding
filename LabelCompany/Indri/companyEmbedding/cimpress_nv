Business operations[edit]
Cimpress is based in Venlo, Netherlands and employs 10000 people globally across manufacturing, marketing, technology, software development, sales and support functions.[2] It has offices and manufacturing facilities throughout Europe, North and South America, India, Australia, Philippines, China and Japan.[1]
Through the use of its own patented technology, Cimpress aggregates, via the Internet, large volumes of small, individually customized orders for a broad spectrum of print, signage, apparel and similar products.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded under the name Bonne Impression in 1995 in Paris, France by current President and CEO Robert Keane.[3] It was a direct marketer of desktop publishing software and pre-printed laser-printer-compatible specialty papers for printing brochures, stationery and business cards from the desktops – focused on small business customers. In 1999, the company moved its business to the internet and changed its name to Vistaprint.[3]
This was followed by its initial public offering in 2005 when it began trading on the Nasdaq under VPRT.[4] The company built its first manufacturing facility in Venlo, the Netherlands, in 2003.[5] This was followed by a North American production facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, in 2005.[6] It continued to expand its operations, opening manufacturing plants in Deer Park, Australia and Bhiwandi, India, and numerous offices around the world.
In November 2014, the company changed its name from Vistaprint N.V. to Cimpress N.V. to clarify the distinction between the corporate entity's manufacturing platform and the company’s portfolio of customer-facing brands.[1]
Acquisitions[edit]
Cimpress has acquired several companies that specialize in online printing and mass customization.
In November 2011, Cimpress acquired Albumprinter, a company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands that produces photobooks and Webs, a company based in Silver Spring, Maryland, that enables users to create free websites.[7]
In 2014, Cimpress acquired People & Print Group (renamed Printdeal as of January 1, 2015), an online printing company based in Deventer, Netherlands.[8] In the same year, it acquired Pixartprinting, an online printing company based in Quarto d'Altino, Italy.[9]
In 2015, Cimpress acquired three additional online printing companies in Europe: Druck.at, Easyflyer, Exaprint and Tradeprint.[1]
In 2016, Cimpress acquired German online printing company WIRmachenDRUCK, x`x[10] and San Diego-based National Pen Company.[11]
Manufacturing[edit]
Cimpress has manufacturing facilities in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Australia, totaling over 140,000 square meters (1,500,000 square feet) of manufacturing space.[1] In 2016, the company opened its first US manufacturing plant in Reno, Nevada.[12]
Shared Manufacturing Platform[edit]
The company holds more than 220 patents, many of which are related to printing and computer integrated manufacturing.[1] Its manufacturing capabilities are organized into one shared platform that is leveraged across all of its customer-facing brands. This shared mass customization platform is a combination of its own production facilities and its network of partners, suppliers and fulfillers. Cimpress produces a variety of products that are brought to market via a portfolio of customer-focused brands. Its product categories include: marketing materials, business cards, brochures, stationery, invitations and announcements, calendars, photobooks, promotional products, signage, flags and banners, embroidered apparel, packing and other consumer photo products.
Partnerships[edit]
In 2015, the company began outsourcing certain aspects of its manufacturing to broaden its product offering and to increase its ability to serve local customers quickly.
Brands[edit]
Cimpress sells its products through several customer-facing brands that include:[1]

About Us


 


We’re passionate about empowering people to make an impression through individually meaningful, personalized physical products.
Cimpress makes customized print, signage, apparel, gifts, identity merchandise, packaging and other products accessible and affordable to everyone. This is possible because of the mass customization capabilities we’ve developed over the last 20 years - a proprietary combination of capabilities including software development, e-commerce, content creation, graphic file processing, marketing, customer service, production technologies, and manufacturing and supply chain operations.








 Tangible, Personalized Impressions Matter


In an increasingly digital world, the way people interact has changed. Digital is powerful, in part because it allows us to connect with a wide audience with speed and flexibility.
What’s missing from the digital experience is a personal, tangible connection that is often important.  Businesses and consumers have given up that tangible connection in exchange for the speed and flexibility of digital communications.
We change that.  We enable our customers to make a tangible impression when it matters most.  Whether it's apparel decorated with a company logo or an announcement celebrating the birth of a newborn baby, we bring together that very real sense of connection, with the speed and personalization that people have come to expect from today’s digital world.








 
 





How We Got Here


More than 20 years ago, Cimpress was a one-person company that launched from the spare bedroom in a small apartment in Paris. Today, we’re a global company with $1.7 billion (USD) in revenue. We have operations in 19 countries serving nearly 17 million customers a year.
Take a look at some of our proudest moments over the years.

Our History


 20 Years. Countless Milestones.


In 1994, Cimpress founder Robert Keane wanted to give small business owners access to the same high-quality, custom-printed products that bigger companies (with bigger print budgets) enjoyed.
More than 20 years later, Robert continues to lead Cimpress, which is now the world leader in mass customization and a remarkable success story that has gone from startup to over $1.8 billion USD in annual revenues.
Take a look at some of our proudest moments over the years.

Robert Keane conceives of “Internet based ganging”. Software will now automatically aggregate many individual orders of business cards into a single digital file, which then is printed using just one press setup, before being cut up and separated into individual orders.  This concept, patented in 1999, will prove to radically reduce production costs over the coming years.

1996 to 1999

January 1995
Robert starts our company in the spare bedroom of his Paris apartment. During the first year of business, most revenues come from freelance market research and consulting work for Microsoft’s “Publisher” desktop publishing software team, studying the needs of small businesses to design and produce printed materials from their desktop.


 



July to December 1994
Robert Keane identifies a clear market need for high-quality, low-cost printing of small business marketing materials. He is so busy writing his business plan that he misses his INSEAD graduation ceremony.

In November 2014, the company changed its name from Vistaprint N.V. to Cimpress N.V. to clarify the distinction between the corporate entity's manufacturing platform and the company’s portfolio of customer-facing brands.[1]

Business operations[edit]
Cimpress is based in Venlo, Netherlands and employs 10000 people globally across manufacturing, marketing, technology, software development, sales and support functions.[2] It has offices and manufacturing facilities throughout Europe, North and South America, India, Australia, Philippines, China and Japan.[1]
Through the use of its own patented technology, Cimpress aggregates, via the Internet, large volumes of small, individually customized orders for a broad spectrum of print, signage, apparel and similar products.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded under the name Bonne Impression in 1995 in Paris, France by current President and CEO Robert Keane.[3] It was a direct marketer of desktop publishing software and pre-printed laser-printer-compatible specialty papers for printing brochures, stationery and business cards from the desktops – focused on small business customers. In 1999, the company moved its business to the internet and changed its name to Vistaprint.[3]
This was followed by its initial public offering in 2005 when it began trading on the Nasdaq under VPRT.[4] The company built its first manufacturing facility in Venlo, the Netherlands, in 2003.[5] This was followed by a North American production facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, in 2005.[6] It continued to expand its operations, opening manufacturing plants in Deer Park, Australia and Bhiwandi, India, and numerous offices around the world.
In November 2014, the company changed its name from Vistaprint N.V. to Cimpress N.V. to clarify the distinction between the corporate entity's manufacturing platform and the company’s portfolio of customer-facing brands.[1]
Acquisitions[edit]
Cimpress has acquired several companies that specialize in online printing and mass customization.
In November 2011, Cimpress acquired Albumprinter, a company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands that produces photobooks and Webs, a company based in Silver Spring, Maryland, that enables users to create free websites.[7]
In 2014, Cimpress acquired People & Print Group (renamed Printdeal as of January 1, 2015), an online printing company based in Deventer, Netherlands.[8] In the same year, it acquired Pixartprinting, an online printing company based in Quarto d'Altino, Italy.[9]
In 2015, Cimpress acquired three additional online printing companies in Europe: Druck.at, Easyflyer, Exaprint and Tradeprint.[1]
In 2016, Cimpress acquired German online printing company WIRmachenDRUCK, x`x[10] and San Diego-based National Pen Company.[11]
Manufacturing[edit]
Cimpress has manufacturing facilities in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Australia, totaling over 140,000 square meters (1,500,000 square feet) of manufacturing space.[1] In 2016, the company opened its first US manufacturing plant in Reno, Nevada.[12]
Shared Manufacturing Platform[edit]
The company holds more than 220 patents, many of which are related to printing and computer integrated manufacturing.[1] Its manufacturing capabilities are organized into one shared platform that is leveraged across all of its customer-facing brands. This shared mass customization platform is a combination of its own production facilities and its network of partners, suppliers and fulfillers. Cimpress produces a variety of products that are brought to market via a portfolio of customer-focused brands. Its product categories include: marketing materials, business cards, brochures, stationery, invitations and announcements, calendars, photobooks, promotional products, signage, flags and banners, embroidered apparel, packing and other consumer photo products.
Partnerships[edit]
In 2015, the company began outsourcing certain aspects of its manufacturing to broaden its product offering and to increase its ability to serve local customers quickly.
Brands[edit]
Cimpress sells its products through several customer-facing brands that include:[1]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NIC (NASDAQ:EGOV) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 5 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $19.67 (20.29% upside)

This shared mass customization platform is a combination of its own production facilities and its network of partners, suppliers and fulfillers. Cimpress produces a variety of products that are brought to market via a portfolio of customer-focused brands. Its product categories include: marketing materials, business cards, brochures, stationery, invitations and announcements, calendars, photobooks, promotional products, signage, flags and banners, embroidered apparel, packing and other consumer photo products.

Business operations[edit]
Cimpress is based in Venlo, Netherlands and employs 10000 people globally across manufacturing, marketing, technology, software development, sales and support functions.[2] It has offices and manufacturing facilities throughout Europe, North and South America, India, Australia, Philippines, China and Japan.[1]
Through the use of its own patented technology, Cimpress aggregates, via the Internet, large volumes of small, individually customized orders for a broad spectrum of print, signage, apparel and similar products.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded under the name Bonne Impression in 1995 in Paris, France by current President and CEO Robert Keane.[3] It was a direct marketer of desktop publishing software and pre-printed laser-printer-compatible specialty papers for printing brochures, stationery and business cards from the desktops – focused on small business customers. In 1999, the company moved its business to the internet and changed its name to Vistaprint.[3]
This was followed by its initial public offering in 2005 when it began trading on the Nasdaq under VPRT.[4] The company built its first manufacturing facility in Venlo, the Netherlands, in 2003.[5] This was followed by a North American production facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, in 2005.[6] It continued to expand its operations, opening manufacturing plants in Deer Park, Australia and Bhiwandi, India, and numerous offices around the world.
In November 2014, the company changed its name from Vistaprint N.V. to Cimpress N.V. to clarify the distinction between the corporate entity's manufacturing platform and the company’s portfolio of customer-facing brands.[1]
Acquisitions[edit]
Cimpress has acquired several companies that specialize in online printing and mass customization.
In November 2011, Cimpress acquired Albumprinter, a company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands that produces photobooks and Webs, a company based in Silver Spring, Maryland, that enables users to create free websites.[7]
In 2014, Cimpress acquired People & Print Group (renamed Printdeal as of January 1, 2015), an online printing company based in Deventer, Netherlands.[8] In the same year, it acquired Pixartprinting, an online printing company based in Quarto d'Altino, Italy.[9]
In 2015, Cimpress acquired three additional online printing companies in Europe: Druck.at, Easyflyer, Exaprint and Tradeprint.[1]
In 2016, Cimpress acquired German online printing company WIRmachenDRUCK, x`x[10] and San Diego-based National Pen Company.[11]
Manufacturing[edit]
Cimpress has manufacturing facilities in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Australia, totaling over 140,000 square meters (1,500,000 square feet) of manufacturing space.[1] In 2016, the company opened its first US manufacturing plant in Reno, Nevada.[12]
Shared Manufacturing Platform[edit]
The company holds more than 220 patents, many of which are related to printing and computer integrated manufacturing.[1] Its manufacturing capabilities are organized into one shared platform that is leveraged across all of its customer-facing brands. This shared mass customization platform is a combination of its own production facilities and its network of partners, suppliers and fulfillers. Cimpress produces a variety of products that are brought to market via a portfolio of customer-focused brands. Its product categories include: marketing materials, business cards, brochures, stationery, invitations and announcements, calendars, photobooks, promotional products, signage, flags and banners, embroidered apparel, packing and other consumer photo products.
Partnerships[edit]
In 2015, the company began outsourcing certain aspects of its manufacturing to broaden its product offering and to increase its ability to serve local customers quickly.
Brands[edit]
Cimpress sells its products through several customer-facing brands that include:[1]

Albelli
Bonusprint

Druck.at
Drukwerkdeal
Easyflyer
Exaprint
Fotoknudsen

Business operations[edit]
Cimpress is based in Venlo, Netherlands and employs 10000 people globally across manufacturing, marketing, technology, software development, sales and support functions.[2] It has offices and manufacturing facilities throughout Europe, North and South America, India, Australia, Philippines, China and Japan.[1]
Through the use of its own patented technology, Cimpress aggregates, via the Internet, large volumes of small, individually customized orders for a broad spectrum of print, signage, apparel and similar products.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded under the name Bonne Impression in 1995 in Paris, France by current President and CEO Robert Keane.[3] It was a direct marketer of desktop publishing software and pre-printed laser-printer-compatible specialty papers for printing brochures, stationery and business cards from the desktops – focused on small business customers. In 1999, the company moved its business to the internet and changed its name to Vistaprint.[3]
This was followed by its initial public offering in 2005 when it began trading on the Nasdaq under VPRT.[4] The company built its first manufacturing facility in Venlo, the Netherlands, in 2003.[5] This was followed by a North American production facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, in 2005.[6] It continued to expand its operations, opening manufacturing plants in Deer Park, Australia and Bhiwandi, India, and numerous offices around the world.
In November 2014, the company changed its name from Vistaprint N.V. to Cimpress N.V. to clarify the distinction between the corporate entity's manufacturing platform and the company’s portfolio of customer-facing brands.[1]
Acquisitions[edit]
Cimpress has acquired several companies that specialize in online printing and mass customization.
In November 2011, Cimpress acquired Albumprinter, a company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands that produces photobooks and Webs, a company based in Silver Spring, Maryland, that enables users to create free websites.[7]
In 2014, Cimpress acquired People & Print Group (renamed Printdeal as of January 1, 2015), an online printing company based in Deventer, Netherlands.[8] In the same year, it acquired Pixartprinting, an online printing company based in Quarto d'Altino, Italy.[9]
In 2015, Cimpress acquired three additional online printing companies in Europe: Druck.at, Easyflyer, Exaprint and Tradeprint.[1]
In 2016, Cimpress acquired German online printing company WIRmachenDRUCK, x`x[10] and San Diego-based National Pen Company.[11]
Manufacturing[edit]
Cimpress has manufacturing facilities in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Australia, totaling over 140,000 square meters (1,500,000 square feet) of manufacturing space.[1] In 2016, the company opened its first US manufacturing plant in Reno, Nevada.[12]
Shared Manufacturing Platform[edit]
The company holds more than 220 patents, many of which are related to printing and computer integrated manufacturing.[1] Its manufacturing capabilities are organized into one shared platform that is leveraged across all of its customer-facing brands. This shared mass customization platform is a combination of its own production facilities and its network of partners, suppliers and fulfillers. Cimpress produces a variety of products that are brought to market via a portfolio of customer-focused brands. Its product categories include: marketing materials, business cards, brochures, stationery, invitations and announcements, calendars, photobooks, promotional products, signage, flags and banners, embroidered apparel, packing and other consumer photo products.
Partnerships[edit]
In 2015, the company began outsourcing certain aspects of its manufacturing to broaden its product offering and to increase its ability to serve local customers quickly.

Cimpress sells its products through several customer-facing brands that include:[1]
