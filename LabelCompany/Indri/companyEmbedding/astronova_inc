Daxus® Data AcquisitionWhen and Where You Need It 










Daxus® Data AcquisitionWhen and Where You Need It Daxus is a smart modern approach to data acquisition from AstroNova. It’s a data acquisition system that lets you record and transmit data anywhere, any time. Daxus is bringing data acquisition to the forefront of the digital age with smart phone compatibility, wireless internet connectivity. Daxus is a stackable, networkable, portable and powerful data acquisition that you can use anywhere.
Daxus can be used as a single stand-alone unit for troubleshooting and maintenance, stacked for high channel count jobs, or networked with multiple units located throughout your facility for synchronized data recording in distributed data applications. With the Daxus system you can record only a few signals or hundreds of parameters essential to maintaining efficient operations.

Mobile Powerful Stackable Data Acquisition System

Up to 32 channels
200k samples/second
500GB internal hard drive (SSD optional)
Wireless connectivity
Real time data capture via android phone or tablet app
Download the Daxus Brochure for Input Module options and specifications

You Can Record Data in Any Configuration:
Stack multiple Daxus units to achieve higher channel counts as needed.
Mobile App
Daxus is all about mobility. View real-time, scrolling waveform data of your ongoing data acquisition on your smartphone or tablet via the Daxus mobile app. You can also receive notifications and review recent captures for quick, on-demand troubleshooting.
Networked
In networked applications, an unlimited number of Daxus units can be controlled and monitored, wirelessly or through Gigabit Ethernet interface, from a central workstation or multiple PCs on your network. Daxus captures, handles, and stores all data locally. Network bandwidth has no impact on sample rates.
Stand-Alone
When used as a standalone data acquisition device, simply configure your Daxus or stacked Daxus systems for high channel counts on a PC using the included software. Disconnect the PC and let Daxus collect data or load your Daxus setup files onto a USB thumb drive and upload them directly to Daxus for storage. Daxus features a front panel display with dedicated control buttons for loading setup files, starting or stopping data captures and triggering.
PC Software
For PC-based applications, the powerful Daxus software provides intuitive drop-down menus and a customizable control panel to set up one-touch controls for your convenience. Available functions include: loading and saving setup files, amplifier settings, data capture and triggering parameters, cursor measurements and review & analyze functions.
Recording Capacity
Each Daxus has immense data recording capacity with a standard 500GB SATA drive or optional 400 or 800 GB Solid State Drives for more demanding environments. Intelligent Data Capture features include pre/post triggering, logical and/or triggers, multiple sample rates and data capture automation for repetitive testing. The battery backup ensures no loss of data in the event of a power disruption.

Daxus Features
Real Time data acquisition with Daxus is simple. Real time signals can be viewed on a PC in a scrolling waveform style, or on a smartphone or tablet using the Daxus mobile app.
With Scope Mode, Daxus provides a DSO-style display that is useful for viewing high speed signals in detail or where a stationary waveform view is preferred.
The Review capability allows you to review captured data and has been designed for analysis, including expansion, compression, search features, measurements and more.
Engineering Units of your choice can be set up on any channel with linear scaling for any application. This allows data to be viewed in familiar terms such as Amps, PSI, RPM, Ft-lbs., etc.
A built-in Meter Package provides the ability to display screen data in easy to read visual format. Choose from various meter formats including gage, numeric, horizontal or vertical bar, needle and LED readouts. These can be sized and placed anywhere on screen for a truly custom look and feel.
Cursors are easy to use and allow immediate measurements with functions such as: Time, Sample Point, Average, Min/Max & Peak-Peak Slope, RMS, Sum, Sum of Squares, Variance, Standard Deviation and Area.
Optional Interfaces
Interfaces include CAN Bus for automotive testing, IRIG time codes for aerospace applications and GPS time and location stamping for transportation or other applications.

ToughWriter 5 »


                            The ToughWriter® 5 is the latest generation airborne printing solution. Its ARINC429, Ethernet and Wi-Fi ports are ideal for printing text and graphics from Electronic Flight Bags, iPads and other tablet devices.  It has the lowest size and weight in the industry and its small footprint makes it suitable for installation in almost any aircraft.                        


ToughWriter 4 »


                            The ToughWriter® 4 is the fourth generation airborne printer from AstroNova. With its crisp, high resolution thermal printing and industry-best print speed, the ToughWriter 4 is a proven standard for wide format, airborne printing.  It’s the printer of choice for the B787 and A380 flight decks and major in-flight entertainment system manufacturers.                        


ToughWriter 640 »


                            The ToughWriter® 640 is AstroNova’s newest ARINC 740 printer. With a compact design and light weight - under five pounds with a full roll of paper - it’s perfectly suited for installation in narrow body aircraft where flight deck space is at a premium.  It’s the first narrow format flight deck printer to include Ethernet for printing graphical information.                        


Miltope Series »


                            AstroNova™ acquired Miltope’s airborne printer business - including the TP4429 narrow format printer and TP4840 and NP4840 wide format printers - in 2014.  Miltope printers are used in commercial and military aircraft and sold to aircraft manufacturers, tier one contractors and directly to airlines throughout the world.                        


RTP80 Series »


                            RTP80 wide format printers are certified on several major commercial transport aircraft and regional jets.

      announced today that the company will begin doing business as AstroNova 
      on a worldwide basis, effective immediately.
    


      “As we developed our plans to modernize the company and transform it 
      into a business that could deliver double-digit annual growth, it became 
      clear a new name would be essential to effectively communicate our 
      strategy,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Gregory A. Woods. 
      “The name AstroNova fits our strategy well. ‘Astro’ references our 
      strong roots in the aerospace business. ‘Nova’ comes from the Latin word 
      ‘novus,’ meaning ‘new.’ Our new brand emphasizes our traditional 
      strengths in aerospace, along with our expanding presence in test & 
      measurement, product identification, and other new areas where we can 
      apply our data visualization technology,” Woods said.
    

      The Company’s business includes:
    

      • AstroNova Aerospace (Ruggedized Products)
    

      • AstroNova Product Identification (QuickLabel Systems – An AstroNova 
      Division)
    

      • AstroNova Test & Measurement (Data Acquisition Products)
    

      Astro-Med’s Ruggedized Products and Test & Measurement businesses will 
      adopt the AstroNova brand. QuickLabel Systems products will continue to 
      go to market under the QuickLabel® brand, with a new logo and 
      brand colors. Corporate and product line logos and colors will be 
      aligned under a new AstroNova branding system.
    

      The company has filed for trademark protection of the AstroNova name and 
      logo in the United States and other countries.
    

      The company’s shares will continue to trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange 
      under its official name, Astro-Med, Inc., using its present ticker 
      symbol, ALOT.
    

      “We believe the new AstroNova brand will unify our organization, and 
      provide an exciting opportunity to communicate our company’s potential 
      for innovation and growth,” said Woods.
