From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.

McHugh, MDlovelykarjon ratedDr. McHugh is a wonderful doct...Dr. McHugh is a wonderful doctor and I am so happy with my results. I went around to several other doctors, and to be mature, I won't comment on the experiences there, but out of all, Dr. McHugh, his wife and staff were the most friendly and kind. I was greeted by the most friendly and helpful receptionist, when I was booking my appointment on the phone, I was so amazed at the knowledge she had regarding the procedures I wanted to schedule.  At the consultation, which was for liposuction and  reduction, Dr. McHugh did not rush through the consultation. He took his time to explain in full detail the procedures that I was interested in, and I had a list of questions, in which he answered them all. I was a little nervous, because of previous consultations elsewhere that did not put me at ease, but Dr. McHugh really put me at ease. He did mention that it would be a good idea, but I did not have to get   Lympatic Drainage massages as needed. At the conclusion of the consultation, I got to meet his beautiful wife, Katherine. I have heard negative things about her, but those negative things are so untrue. She is the most down to earth walking Barbie Doll! Great sense of humor! She presented me with the pricing information of the surgery and lymphatic massages. I decided at the consultation that Dr. McHugh was my surgeon for my surgeries, but was short on finances, so Katherine's sister, very friendly and personable, assisted me in getting financed with Care Credit.It was 5 minutes to closing, but she did not rush me out and also worked on getting me codes to make a claim on my insurance for my reduction. After my surgery, his nurse, Ashley, called me every day to check on my progress and was a great support when Dr. McHugh was unable to speak on the phone to address my healing concerns. I do not regret using Dr. McHugh, and I will be using him again in the near future for a necklift! Mattioli Vision Professionals, PAnancychautran ratedProfessional &amp; AwesomeDr. Mattioli did my sister's LASIK a few years ago and thankfully I was able to find him at his new practice.I've had a consult done at another LASIK location but they weren't as welcoming and thorough as Dr. Mattioli. He sat down and discussed every finding and actually explained it in basic terms from my first consult up until the day of my surgery.His team is outstanding. They specialize in what they do and of course are darn good at it. I rarely leave an office knowing everyone's names or what their personalities are like outside of work, but Laura, Jonah, and Janet make an extra effort to have conversations with you to take the ease out of having a boring eye exam. Can you say team LONGEVITY? They've been with him for over 8 years!Lastly, I have to briefly touch base on his technology for all you tech enthusiasts out there. The practice is fairly new so that also means new equipment and newest laser technology!  Your check-in paperwork is completed on an ipad. All of your test data from the eye exams are mapped out on a computer screen so the Dr. can go over and point out what's normal and abnormal within your exam. My LASIK procedure took less than 20 minutes and I was able to see the wall clock for the first time without glasses in 17 years! Thanks Dr. Mattioli - Laura - Janet - Jonah!Berkeley Eye Center - Katy FreewayNeil S. ratedThere are no words to express the level of excellence provided by Dr. Yankelove, Brenda and the entire staff during my Lasik procedure. From the very first day of my Lasik consultation with Brenda Castillo, to the day of my post-op appointment, every step met and exceeded all expectations that I had. Dr. Yankelove was beyond knowledgeable and talented in his field, and it felt very reassuring to get such an important procedure done with an expert of his sort. Brenda was extremely personable and approachable throughout the process and made me feel comfortable and at east throughout. Moreover, they are competitively priced and provide options to meet your financial needs/capabilities. They use the best technology and was a painless procedure, and I had fantastic results the very same night! I would recommend anyone and everyone to this facility if they are considering Lasik- you are in the best hands with a friendly and capable staff. Thanks to Dr. Yankelove and the entire team!El Centro De Corazon 4Leila A. ratedHolistically based healthcare for the whole family--couldn't be happier with the amazing physicians, entire staff and conveniently structured comprehensive services.It's so nice not to have to have to leave the neighborhood for any of our basic healthcare needs. My husband and I can visit our primary care doctor, bring the kids to their pediatrician and all see the same dentist--all under the same roof. Love all the specialized services and programs El Centro offers too. Finally, the "extras" like nutritional counseling for my stepson who has Type 1 Diabetes and behavioral health services for our little ADHD-bots are easily and conveniently accessible too.And the best part of all: Everything is not only available in one place, just down the street, but our private insurance is accepted too! No more searching for and traveling to providers on all sides of town... Thank you, El Centro--truly and from the bottom of my HEART!Mattioli Vision Professionals, PAjoycechiuri ratedDr. Mattioli's office and his staff are very courteous and friendly, they greeted me as soon as i walked into their office.  I went in for a lasik consultation, hoping to get lasik done after wearing glasses for almost 20 years. The doctor answered all my questions and concerns, i had a thorough full exam and the cost was credited into my lasix surgery fee, as soon as he told me i was a good candidate for lasik surgery, we set up an appointment and the nurses helped me figure out the financial stuff. the day of the procedure went very well, everything was thoroughly explained to me and the technology was very impressive. I would definitely recommend him to all my family and friends. I am very pleased with my surgery and i plan on keeping him on as my regular eye doctor.Dr. Shannon Hardy: Complete Women's Care CenterT R. ratedThe office was absolutely gorgeous and immediately makes you feel comfortable as if you were in your own home. The cleanliness and the friendly environment made my experience great before I even went into see Dr. hardy. She was very straightforward and kind when she was talking with me. It definitely put me at ease regarding my issue. I also like how they give you adequate time to get undressed and situated. At other offices, I did not have this same experience. The staff seems to truly care shown by touching on family risk factors and keep up to date with annual testing. After examination she made me feel so relieved. I scheduled my annual exams today and cannot wait to come back. This was a great experience.Li, Huaiguang, MDTim 1. ratedI am a patient. Dr. Li is considerate for me and wise at practicing medicine. As I google his name and read about his background, I find his professional experience further demonstrates significant intellectual capacity even among doctors.  He was schooled in PR China and did much research work there. He came to US as a research scholar but passed exams of US Medicine Board without obtaining a MD in US. But many US-educated MDs can't pass those exams. Meanwhile, he fulfilled the residency requirements which demand grasp of English and much understanding of people. Medicine is a science which require smart people to properly practice. Dr Li is a right person to do so.Hickman, Timothy N, MDL W. ratedWe were referred to Dr. Hickman from multiple friends and colleagues. We had a previous failed IVF experience with another doctor. After explaining our concerns with Dr. Hickman, he was very confident in his plan to get us pregnant. From day 1 we were treated amazingly. The staff greeted me by name, and I formed wonderful relationships with his team. I looked forward to visits because of how positive and uplifting his group was. I met with two other doctors on his team during my stimulation and everyone was wonderful. I highly recommend anyone seeking fertility assistance to start with Houston IVF. We are currently 8 weeks pregnant with a healthy growing baby!Berkeley Eye Center - Katy FreewayTom O. ratedCataract surgery and Lasik procedures were performed by Dr. Yankelove. The pre, during and post procedural care was absolutely excellent. All questions were answered and Dr. Yankelove and his staff treated me like I was their only patient. The results were excellent. The entire staff is caring and proffessional and I have referred several people to Dr. Yankelove. He has the best "bedside manner" I have ever experienced. I have recently been diagnosed as having diabetes. Guess who I went to see for my vision evaluation? Yup, Dr. Yankelove and staff. 2 years later they still continue to provide the best of care and still remembered me by name. The very best!Medinet Family Care Cliniclawyer2050 ratedMy experience with Medinet has always been without problems. The staff is excellent, and the clinic is doing a commendable job. The x-ray tech there is so nice and professional! Although some days the waiting time can be greater than 30 minutes, I always come here specifically to see Dr. Gandhi and it is worth it. There clinic is also convenient because they do everything under one roof. I get my labs, x-rays, and vaccines done there plus many other procedures. Dr. Gandhi is a very professional and good doctor. I highly recommend Medinet Family Care Clinic as I have come here for 10 years and still love the service and treatment they provide here. Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
