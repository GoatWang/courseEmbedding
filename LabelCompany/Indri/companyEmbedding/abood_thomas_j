About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Macphail Center for Music

                    The MacPhail Center for Music is a nonprofit music education center in the Mills District of Downtown East, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The school has over 10,200 students, providing instruction at 72 locations outside of its downtown Minneapolis facility on more than 35 instruments and in a variety of musical styles. A certified member of the National Guild for Community Arts Education, and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, MacPhail remains a steadfast leader in music education.  In 2003, the organization changed its name to MacPhail Center for Music to reflect its dedication to the mission of its founder William S. MacPhail – promoting lifelong learning through music.

In January 2008, MacPhail moved to its current location at 501 South Second St, Minneapolis, a brand new state of the art music facility.

MacPhail Center for Music continues to grow with the number of teaching artists now more than 200 and more than 11,000 students.  MacPhail provides instruction at more than 70 locations outside of its downtown Minneapolis facility in more than 35 instruments and a variety of musical styles like jazz, classical, pop, rock, hip hop and world music.  MacPhail continues to offer the popular Suzuki Talent Education and Early Childhood Music (ECM) programs, and also has developed a Music Therapy department to offer music education and therapy opportunities to individuals with physical and developmental disabilities.  In addition, MacPhail has expanded its course offerings to accommodate adults by scheduling programs during lunchtime and after work, and now offers Live Online Lessons, offering students of all backgrounds, abilities and geographies access to our exceptional music learning experiences.

Through MacPhail’s innovative Community Partnership programs with inner city and greater Twin Cities’ schools and community organizations, MacPhail serves more than 6,000 children who would otherwise not have access to music education.  Each program is tailored to the partner, offering everything from ECM classes at preschools to supplemental music programs at area schools.  In addition, MacPhail helps make music education accessible by awarding more than $500,000 in support annually through its financial aid fund.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
