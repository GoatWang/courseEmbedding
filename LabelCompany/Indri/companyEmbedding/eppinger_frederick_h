Hanover Insurance CEO Eppinger to Exit

Frederick H. Eppinger is stepping down as president, chief executive officer and a director of the Worcester, Mass.-based The Hanover Insurance Group. The announcement said Eppinger, 56, is leaving to pursue other interests.
The company said he will continue to serve in his current role until his successor is appointed and then will be available to assist with the transition as needed until June 30, 2016. The board has initiated a search for Eppinger’s replacement.
Eppinger has led the company since August 2003. Under his direction, The Hanover has transitioned from a regional company to a property/casualty carrier with a global reach. During that time, the company has more than doubled in size and has grown its total capital, book value and earnings power.
Today, the company provides personal, commercial and specialty insurance lines in the United States, exclusively through independent agents and brokers, with a specialist Lloyd’s insurance group, Chaucer, that writes business in approximately 200 countries around the world. Hanover acquired Chaucer in 2011.
Hanover CEO Frederick Eppinger and other company executives at the ringing of the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on April 4, 2012. The insurer was celebrating its 160th year.
“After 12 years of tremendous progress, with the company stronger and better positioned than ever, and with a history of substantial shareholder returns,” Eppinger said, “I have decided that it is time for a new leader to step in and work with our talented management team and all of our talented employees to take our company to the next level. I look forward to new professional opportunities, to spending some extra time with my family, and to pursuing some personal interests.”
For a period starting in 1992, Hanover came under the umbrella of Allmerica Financial, which included State Mutual, a large life insurer. In addition to selling fixed life products, Allmerica became one of the hottest sellers of variable annuities in the late ’90s. It got into deep trouble, however, after the stock market collapsed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The company struggled to generate the investment returns it had guaranteed the holders of its variable annuities.
Allmerica President and CEO John F. O’Brien, who championed the variable annuity sales, resigned in October 2002. In 2003, the company sold its fixed life insurance business and in August of that year hired Eppinger to take over the company.
Under Eppinger, Hanover restructured after shedding its life insurance business, focused on diversifying its property/casualty business and expanded geographically into California and other western states. As part of this western strategy, it acquired access to $400 million in small and middle market commercial business from One Beacon in 2009.
The company also restored its name, Hanover Insurance Group.
Eppinger oversaw several acquisitions during his tenure including specialty insurer AIX Holdings, chemical insurer Verlan, healthcare industry professional lines writer The Campania Group and Professionals Direct, an insurer for lawyers.
The insurer celebrated its 160th anniversary in 2012.
The Hanover Insurance Group is now the holding company for a group of insurers that includes The Hanover Insurance Co., based in Worcester, Mass., and Citizens Insurance Company of America, headquartered in Howell, Michigan, and Chaucer Holdings, based in London, and their affiliates.
Eppinger has credited independent agents for much of Hanover’s success.
“We grow when other people don’t grow because we solve more problems for the typical agent than most companies. It’s as simple as that,” Eppinger said in assessing the firm on its 160th anniversary. “Our whole vision is that we combine innovation and this franchise value with agents with this notion of local adults that have authority. We give our professionals authority. Sure we have efficient models and we have automation like everybody else, but we’re not one of the companies that says the black box runs this place.”
Before joining Hanover, Eppinger was executive vice president of Property and Casualty Field and Service Operations for The Hartford Financial Services Group. Prior to that, he was a senior vice president from 2000 to 2001 for ChannelPoint, a business-to-business technology firm for insurance companies, and was a senior partner at the consulting firm of McKinsey & Co., where he led the insurance practice and worked closely with insurance CEOs over a period of 15 years, beginning in 1985. Eppinger began his career as an accountant with Coopers & Lybrand.
Michael P. Angelini, chairman of the Hanover board, praised the departing executive.
“Fred made extraordinary contributions to The Hanover during what was a critical period and he has positioned our company for the future with a distinctive strategy and distribution platform, a highly experienced team, and a growing global presence,” said Angelini. “We appreciate all that Fred has done for our organization and wish him all the best. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial goals as we continue to deliver value to all of our constituents.”

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

The Profile 
Frederick H. Eppinger ’81
By Michael Reardon
Fred Eppinger ’81 would probably be embarrassed to be called  a “hometown hero,” but that’s exactly what he is. Eppinger, who was raised on a  chicken farm in neighboring Spencer, was instrumental in saving Allmerica  Financial Corp. from financial ruin and, in the process, preserving this  Worcester-based institution, as well as thousands of jobs.
Eppinger joined Allmerica as chief executive officer in  2003, following a year when the company lost $306 million, saw its stock drop  from a high of $52 to $7 a share, and its debt rating downgraded five notches  below investment grade. The outlook for the company was bleak.
Allmerica’s directors looked to the local guy Eppinger—a  veteran of 20 years experience in the insurance and financial services  business, most recently as Executive Vice President at The Hartford—as the man  to turn the company around.
“I care about this company and I care about the community,”  Eppinger says.
Under Eppinger’s leadership, Allmerica, now known as The  Hanover Insurance Group, Inc., has set out to become a world-class insurance  institution. The company has rebounded financially, consistently beating its  core earnings, and generating top shareholder returns for publicly traded  property and casualty companies.
But Eppinger is quick to credit The Hanover’s employees for  the turnaround, saying they refused to let the company that meant so much to  them go under. The Hanover has hired more than 2,000 new employees in the last  30 months.
Although Eppinger considered enrolling at Brown University  in Providence, R.I., he chose to stay in the area to be able to continue to  work on the family farm while attending school. His brother, Charles, who  received his degree from Holy Cross in 1970, spoke highly of the College.
At Holy Cross, Eppinger was greatly influenced by the  emphasis on balancing academic and professional success with service to the  community and other people. His parents were also teaching him this lesson at  home. 
In his present position, Eppinger takes this idea and  applies it to the values of the company. Since joining The Hanover, he has  beefed up its foundation, which has allowed the corporation to make significant  contributions to Worcester, as well as in Howell, Michigan, where the company  employs another 900 people.
“We’re very involved with making things happen in the  community,” Eppinger says. “It’s a big part of who we are.” 
                    In recent years, The Hanover has contributed $1 million to  the UMass Memorial Emergency Care Campaign and worked with Holy Cross to bring  the Tornadoes baseball team to the city.
The Hanover announced in December 2006 that it was  contributing $2 million to the construction of a performing arts center in  downtown Worcester—which is to be called The Hanover Theatre for the Performing  Arts. The Eppingers privately donated a six-figure gift to this effort. 
“I’m proud of what we’ve done as a company and as a team in  the last four years. It has been an extraordinary accomplishment,” Eppinger  says.
Q&A:
How did you meet your wife, Patty?
We went to graduate school together—and I was her accounting  tutor.
Who were your best friends at Holy Cross—and do you still  keep in touch with them?
Jim Hennessey ’81, who lives in Washington, D.C., and Lenny  Leader ’81, who lives in Lunenberg, Mass. We met the first week of school—and  we’ve been friends ever since. Both of them were in my wedding. 
What do you like to do in your spare time?
I’m a dad, and when you have young children, every minute  you spend with them is precious. It’s a very rewarding part of my life watching  them grow up.
Whom do you particularly admire?
My dad, Fred, far and away. He brought up six kids. His work  ethic is extraordinary. He taught us about self-respect—and that everybody is  created equal. He instilled in us the importance of education.
Who had the most influence on your life?
My mom, Leona. She was valedictorian of her high school  class. I didn’t want to study, but she got me to appreciate learning and to  make the most of the opportunities you have.
