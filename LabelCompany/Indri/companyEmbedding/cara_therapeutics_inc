About
Company Overview









Cara Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company located in Stamford, CT focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to fundamentally change the way acute pain, chronic pain and pruritus are managed.  We aim to achieve this by developing new products that selectively target the body’s peripheral kappa opioid receptors. Cara is developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates that target the body’s peripheral nervous system and have demonstrated initial efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain and pruritus (itch) without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available pain and itch therapeutics.

Investors Overview









Cara’s most advanced compound, CR845, is currently undergoing clinical testing for acute pain, chronic pain and uremic pruritus (itch). In multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trials in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy or bunionectomy procedures, I.V. CR845 treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions in both pain intensity and opioid-related side effects.
With well over 1000 subjects dosed to date, CR845 was found to be well tolerated, without incurring the dysphoric and psychotomimetic side effects that have been reported with centrally acting (CNS-active) kappa opioid receptor agonists.

Therapeutic Focus
Fundamentally Different Approach to Pain & Itch









Pain Management: A Need for Innovation
Medicines for acute and chronic pain management have not fundamentally changed for over 50-100 years!  Mu opioids (e.g. morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone), NSAIDs (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen) and acetaminophen account for over 80% of the drugs taken for pain management.

The first mu opioid, morphine, was discovered in 1803.
The first NSAID, aspirin, was launched in 1899.
Subsequent NSAIDs like indomethacin and ibuprofen were discovered in the 1950s and launched in the 1960s.
Acetaminophen was launched in the 1950s.

There has been modest improvements in these drug classes over the years since the first products launched; however, the drugs taken today still fundamentally work in the same manner and have similar side effects and problems as the drugs that were discovered and launched 50 to 100 years ago. It is time for a fundamental change in the way we manage pain.
















Working to Fundamentally Change Pain Management
Cara Therapeutics is looking to fundamentally change pain management.  Instead of focusing our efforts on modestly improving old compounds, Cara is developing a completely new class of medicine called Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonists (KORAs).  KORAs target a completely different receptor in the body, the kappa opioid receptor, to treat pain in a fundamentally new way. Our lead pipeline product, CR845, is a peripherally acting KORAs. To date, CR845 has shown in Phase 2 clinical trials promising pain relief without many of the traditional side effects that you see mu opioids (morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone) and NSAIDs (ibuprofen).
 







CR845 Pain Management











Pruritus (Itch) Management: A Major Unmet Need
Similar to the treatments for pain management, there has been very little innovation in medicines that specifically treat patients’ pruritus or itch. The mainstays for treating itch today are still corticosteroids and antihistamines. The first corticosteroids and antihistamines (like diphenhydramine or Benadryl) were discovered and launched in the 1940s. There have been modest improvements in these drug classes in the subsequent years, but the products utilized today are very similar in action and side effects as those used over 50 years ago.







CR845 Pruritus EN V03











Working to Fundamentally Change Pruritus (Itch) Management
Cara Therapeutics is also looking to fundamentally change pruritus (itch) management.  Cara is developing a completely new class of medicine called Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonists (KORAs).  KORAs target a completely different receptor in the body, the kappa opioid receptor, to treat itch in a fundamentally new way.  Our lead pipeline product, CR845, is a peripherally acting KORAs.  To date, CR845 has shown in Phase 2 clinical trials promising improvements in itch relief in a very difficult to treat itch condition called uremic pruritus, an itch that develops in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and in particular dialysis patients.

UPDATE: Cara Therapeutics shares surge 13.7% premarket on positive trial results
Shares of Cara Therapeutics Inc.  surged 13.7% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company reported positive results in an early-stage trial of a treatment for chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus patients, or CKD-aP. Pruritus, or itch, is a common symptom for patients with chronic renal failure, affecting about half of those with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Cara said results from the Phase 1 trial of Oral CR845 in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis showed all four tablet strengths were well-tolerated on a daily basis or after dialysis three times a week. CR845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist currently in development for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and pruritus, said Cara. Plasma levels of CR845 attained after oral administration of the 1.0 mg tablet strength were close to those attained with the 1.0 mcg/kg I.V. CR845 dose, "which demonstrated significant clinical benefit" in another recent trial, the company said. Frédérique Menzaghi, Ph.D., vice president of research and development at Cara, said the data will inform the design of a planned Oral CR845 pruritus clinical program in the non-dialysis CKD-aP population, which the company is planning to start later this year. Cara shares have gained 35% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

Cara Therapeutics' stock plunges after mixed trial results prompts analyst downgrade
Shares of Cara Therapeutics Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Friday, after mixed results from a phase 2b trial of the biotechnology company's pain medication prompted a downgrade at Janney Montgomery Scott. Analyst Ken Trbovich cut his rating to neutral from buy, saying the results of the trial weren't strong enough to achieve statistical significance at the highest dose and did not show an effect at lower doses. The result of the trial "gives us less confidence in the outlook for a positive outcome for the phase 3 than we had previously," Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. The stock had nearly tripled year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  had rallied 18% and the S&P 500  had gained 8.1%.

Why This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June
Cara Therapeutics (CARA) stock popped Wednesday after the biotech unveiled strong data from a Phase 1 trial of chronic kidney disease patients — giving its shares a leg up for the second day running. Cara shares have been volatile over the past month. Cara was the de facto leader of a late-June spike in the biotech market.

UPDATE: Cara Therapeutics shares surge 13.7% premarket on positive trial results
Shares of Cara Therapeutics Inc.  surged 13.7% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company reported positive results in an early-stage trial of a treatment for chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus patients, or CKD-aP. Pruritus, or itch, is a common symptom for patients with chronic renal failure, affecting about half of those with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Cara said results from the Phase 1 trial of Oral CR845 in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis showed all four tablet strengths were well-tolerated on a daily basis or after dialysis three times a week. CR845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist currently in development for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and pruritus, said Cara. Plasma levels of CR845 attained after oral administration of the 1.0 mg tablet strength were close to those attained with the 1.0 mcg/kg I.V. CR845 dose, "which demonstrated significant clinical benefit" in another recent trial, the company said. Frédérique Menzaghi, Ph.D., vice president of research and development at Cara, said the data will inform the design of a planned Oral CR845 pruritus clinical program in the non-dialysis CKD-aP population, which the company is planning to start later this year. Cara shares have gained 35% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

Cara Therapeutics' stock plunges after mixed trial results prompts analyst downgrade
Shares of Cara Therapeutics Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Friday, after mixed results from a phase 2b trial of the biotechnology company's pain medication prompted a downgrade at Janney Montgomery Scott. Analyst Ken Trbovich cut his rating to neutral from buy, saying the results of the trial weren't strong enough to achieve statistical significance at the highest dose and did not show an effect at lower doses. The result of the trial "gives us less confidence in the outlook for a positive outcome for the phase 3 than we had previously," Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. The stock had nearly tripled year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  had rallied 18% and the S&P 500  had gained 8.1%.

Why This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June
Cara Therapeutics (CARA) stock popped Wednesday after the biotech unveiled strong data from a Phase 1 trial of chronic kidney disease patients — giving its shares a leg up for the second day running. Cara shares have been volatile over the past month. Cara was the de facto leader of a late-June spike in the biotech market.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
