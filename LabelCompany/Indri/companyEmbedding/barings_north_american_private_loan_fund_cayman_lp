 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.
