Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

OPEC’s Not In Charge Anymore… Here’s How You Benefit














Simply sign up to receive our daily e-Letter, Energy and Capital, to get our new report.
OPEC’s Not In Charge Anymore…Here’s How You Benefit


Your email address:







July 25th, 2017
OPEC has controlled oil prices for over 55 years…
They were the ones who decided whether oil prices would rise or fall.
Many thought they were all-powerful…
Until they weren’t.
OPEC lost control of its biggest supplier of oil and the U.S. is taking advantage of it.
Through fracking, we now have the technology to match OPEC’s prices… and beat them too.
Oil investors need to know the latest news about OPEC’s fall from grace and how it’ll affect them.
That’s why we’ve created a free report called, “OPEC’s Loss, Your Gain: Three Hot Oil Stocks to Invest In.”
In this report we detail:

The history of OPEC;
How it became so powerful;
What tumbled it from its pedestal;

We’ll also tell you how to invest your money in the oil market by giving you three stocks we recommend, along with their details and ticker symbols.
Oil investing is a volatile market. Make sure you know how to invest so that you can be the one on top.
All you need to do to get your free report is enter your email. It’s that simple.
Don’t wait, get your report, “OPEC’s Loss, Your Gain: Three Hot Oil Stocks to Invest In” today.


Your email address:








After getting your report, you'll begin to receive the Energy and Capital e-letter in your inbox daily.
Become an Energy and Capital member today. There's absolutely no obligation — ever.
