France: Launch of Aviva Investors in France - New names for SICAV and FCP companies







France: Launch of Aviva Investors in France - New names for SICAV and FCP companies













05 Nov 2008
29 September 2008 saw the official creation of Aviva Investors, the global asset management arm of Aviva plc. The first activity of its kind, Aviva Investors is made up of 1,100 team members in 21 countries. In France, Aviva's asset management division, Aviva Gestion d'Actifs, will now be known as Aviva Investors France. Creating a single international centre for asset management gives Aviva Investors France an unprecedented opportunity for growth, both nationally and internationally.In order to capitalise on the Aviva brand and the new Aviva Investors brand, the names of most UCITS, of which Aviva Investors France is a management company, will be changing. For example, "Victoire Actions Euro" becomes "Aviva Actions Euro" and "Victoire Convertibles" becomes "Aviva Convertibles".The creation of Aviva Investors and the new name for our range of UCITS companies are both central elements in preserving the continuity of the group's vision: "One Aviva, Twice the Value". This vision will see the group evolving into an integrated group model, in order to make the most of our existing activities and reinforce the strength of our brand.Below is a table detailing the new names of our main funds.-ends-Press contacts:Aviva VieDavid ChenuTelephone: +33 (0) 1 76 62 67 92  E-mail: david_chenu@aviva.fr HDL CommunicationValérie DudoitTelephone: +33 (0) 1 58 65 20 16  E-mail: vdudoit@hdlcom.com Notes to editors:About AvivaAviva is Europe's leading provider of life assurance and pensions savings with strong positions on other markets around the world.

History[edit]
Aviva plc was created following the merger of CGU (Commercial General Union) and Norwich Union in May 2000 but its roots can be traced back over 300 years.
Norwich Union was founded in 1797, while CGU origins go back to 1696 when ‘Hand-in-Hand’ (one of the earliest fire insurance companies) was established. This was one of many companies that later became absorbed into CGU. The merger of CGU plc and Norwich Union plc in May 2000 created a successor company, Aviva plc (formerly CGNU plc) following the purchase of Geoffrey Morley & Partners. In July 2000 the asset management businesses of Morley Fund Management Ltd and Norwich Union Investment Management Ltd were merged. This business subsequently became Aviva Investors Global Services Limited in September 2008.
The Central Bank of Ireland fined Aviva Investors in July 2011 for failing to have proper controls and procedures surrounding the safeguarding of client assets.[2][3]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Aviva Investors is a founding signatory and a strong supporter of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and plays a formal role in the UN PRI and actively participate in leading engagements through the UN PRI Clearing House.
Aviva Investors are committed to the principles of the UK Stewardship Code and International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) Global Corporate Governance Principles and are signatories to the UN Global Compact and formally recognise international standards such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation core labour standards.
Aviva Investors are proactively engaged in initiatives (such as the Rio+20 call to action) to correct market failures through engagement with policy makers (at a national, EU and UN level).
In July 2013, the UK Government’s Innovation and Skills Select Committee published its inquiry into the Kay Review of the equity markets and long-term decision making. The committee published Aviva Investors’ policy proposal as one of its primary recommendations to Government in its report.
Senior management[edit]
In July 2013 Aviva announced the appointment of Euan Munro as CEO of Aviva Investors. Euan has taken up the role in January 2014 and will join the Aviva Group Executive reporting to Mark Wilson, Group Chief Executive Officer.

Chief Executive - Euan Munro
People director - Liz Ashford

This organisation became the London-based asset management division of CGU in 1999 following the merger with General Accident and in 2000 Morley merged with Norwich Union Investment Management following the earlier merger of CGU with Norwich Union.

History[edit]
Aviva plc was created following the merger of CGU (Commercial General Union) and Norwich Union in May 2000 but its roots can be traced back over 300 years.
Norwich Union was founded in 1797, while CGU origins go back to 1696 when ‘Hand-in-Hand’ (one of the earliest fire insurance companies) was established. This was one of many companies that later became absorbed into CGU. The merger of CGU plc and Norwich Union plc in May 2000 created a successor company, Aviva plc (formerly CGNU plc) following the purchase of Geoffrey Morley & Partners. In July 2000 the asset management businesses of Morley Fund Management Ltd and Norwich Union Investment Management Ltd were merged. This business subsequently became Aviva Investors Global Services Limited in September 2008.
The Central Bank of Ireland fined Aviva Investors in July 2011 for failing to have proper controls and procedures surrounding the safeguarding of client assets.[2][3]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Aviva Investors is a founding signatory and a strong supporter of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and plays a formal role in the UN PRI and actively participate in leading engagements through the UN PRI Clearing House.
Aviva Investors are committed to the principles of the UK Stewardship Code and International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) Global Corporate Governance Principles and are signatories to the UN Global Compact and formally recognise international standards such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation core labour standards.
Aviva Investors are proactively engaged in initiatives (such as the Rio+20 call to action) to correct market failures through engagement with policy makers (at a national, EU and UN level).
In July 2013, the UK Government’s Innovation and Skills Select Committee published its inquiry into the Kay Review of the equity markets and long-term decision making. The committee published Aviva Investors’ policy proposal as one of its primary recommendations to Government in its report.
Senior management[edit]
In July 2013 Aviva announced the appointment of Euan Munro as CEO of Aviva Investors. Euan has taken up the role in January 2014 and will join the Aviva Group Executive reporting to Mark Wilson, Group Chief Executive Officer.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
