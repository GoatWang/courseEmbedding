				     	"I simply wouldn't have been able to decorate my apartment without L.A. Design Concepts: from fabric for upholstery and window treatments to furniture orders, they helped with everything! They are always prompt, professional, and reliable, and I love having access to to-the-trade-only goods. I benefited from their advice and experience while still retaining my own creative freedom. I can't imagine decorating any other way!"
					

Katherine B.
Consumer - Washington, DC





				     	"L. A. Design Concepts provides a unique opportunity for our firm to expand services to our client base. The comprehensiveness of offerings-ability to provide furniture layouts, repertoire of manufacturers on your web site, sensible pricing and (oh so pleasant) talented personalities make your company unparalleled in every way. So genius! If I had one word to describe L. A. Design Concepts it would be breadth"
					

Peter B. Cooper, R.A., C.L.A. Architects
Architect - Scarsdale, N.Y.





				     	"I wanted to thank your staff for all your assistance in obtaining access to the New York Design Center and placing our orders for my wife and me. We have used interior designers in the past and have had great experiences, but always felt we could do a lot of this on our own. When our furniture arrived, we could have not been anymore pleased with our selections. Again, thank you for all your help. Susan and I wish you the best of luck with your business venture."
					

Robert
Consumer - Scarsdale, N.Y.





				     	"I am so relieved that I found your company. I'm always having clients wanting to order a single item from numerous manufacturers. This can be so time consuming working with a new company and getting everything set up. You definitely earn your fee for all the stress this takes away from me. I've already told several other designer friends about you."
					

Curtis
Designer - Chicago, IL





				     	"L.A. Design Concepts team consistently provided me with unparalleled professional courtesy and assistance I could have ever asked for. They have shown to me that they are willing to go above and beyond for their clients, and I feel confident saying that I would use their services again for my next project AND refer them to a friend. Keep up the great work!"
					

Angie Byrd
Consumer - San Francisco, CA





				     	"I wanted to take the time and let you know that my client was extremely happy with her furniture. I was a little apprehensive using your services at first, but you have made the experience so effortless on my end. This is truly a great service to the design community."
					

Karen
Designer - Houston, TX





				     	"LADC is an excellent resource for both nonprofessionals and professionals who prefer to outsource the administrative support of design. The team is knowledgeable, efficient, accommodating, yet professional; and they have all been delightful to work with. From design advice and resource suggestions to the arrival of goods the follow—through has been outstanding. It’s been a pleasure to work with LADC.”
					

Jane Panattoni
Consumer - Monterey, CA





				     	"L.A. Design Concepts was easy, pleasant, and professional. My e-mails were replied to quickly and my order was processed efficiently and arrived on time. I will definitely use them again. L.A. Design Concepts handles all the vendor paperwork, takes on the headaches, and allows me to do what I like to do best... design"
					

Joelle Ragland, Cecitino Home
Designer - Cincinnati, OH





				     	"I would like to thank you for all of your help with my orders from Cache, Formations and Janet Yonaty. You did so much more than just placing my order and saving me thousands of dollars. You helped me with some design issues to include assisting me with picking out the trim for my ottoman and choosing the best tie-backs and stain finish for my sofa."
					

Cristina
Consumer - Knoxville, TN





				     	"Thank you for handling my orders. I usually don't look forward to figuring out the freight and delivery of items to my clients. Everything has arrived so perfectly. You have made the worst part of designing a joy. I will be back soon. Much thanks and best of luck with your business."
					

Mary Lou
Consumer - Nashville, TN





				     	"Thank you for your assistance with our past order. you have been professional, punctual and a pleasure to deal with. I will be sure to contact you with future orders and to recommend you to my clients and colleagues."

REQUEST LETTER












Our Story
Our story begins in 1987 when founder and designer Frank Keshishian launched L.A. Design Concepts a residential interior design firm.
While Mr. Keshishian designed homes for his clients, he recognized a fast growing market of consumers who preferred to make their own design decisions. Understanding that desire, Frank created the first design service offering consumer access to designer "trade only" furnishings.
In 1988, L.A. Design Concepts was nationally recognized as a groundbreaking company revolutionizing consumer access. The Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles was very intrigued with L. A. Design Concepts working model and approached Frank in 1990 to formulate a consumer service program within their design center.  L.A. Design Concepts was now the first service within a design center providing consumer access to â€œtrade onlyï¿½? furnishings. Shortly thereafter, an increasing number of interior designers and architects recognized the value of streamlining their access through one single source. Our service allowed designers to focus on designing for their clients without having to maintain accounts with each individual manufacturer.
