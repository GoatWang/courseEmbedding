Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1915 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: [Montréal? : s.n.] 11 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 456013723

So sorry to hear of Mike's passing. I was out of state at the time and just heard of it last night. 
We were good friends who stayed in touch over the years. I had stopped by to see him the middle of August. 
May he rest in peace.

Mike was dear friend and we were like brothers. We attended Lincoln High School together our freshman years, I went to Benson my sophomore year, he stayed at Lincoln and we then attended Wilson High School from 1956-1958.

Mike was dear friend and we were like brothers. We attended Lincoln High School together our freshman years, I went to Benson my sophomore year, he stayed at Lincoln and we then attended Wilson High School from 1956-1958. We played football together and we were both on the wrestling team. We spent many weekends together at his home on capital highway, singing songs like, Chuck Berry's, Maybellene, wrestled, boxed and ate his Mother's fantastic chocolate chip cookies. She was a wonderful Mother, and she was my second Mother. One afternoon on a Saturday, Mike Narver organized a smoker in Mike's backyard and Mike wore his boxing gloves and I wore my wrestling trunks. Mike charged $2.00 per person for attending and he drew a crowd of about fifteen guys. The idea was that Mike would box me and I would wrestle him. The match when back and forth, Mike hitting me and I would take him down. This went on for 15-20 minutes and the match was called a draw. Well, Mike didn't agree with the decision, nor did I. But the decision was based on the response of the crowd.  Oh, what fun? Over the years I saw Mike on occasion and the last time I saw him was at the 1958 Class Reunion. Mike told me that he was having problems with his back and that he had to use a walker on occasion. We had a great visit at the Reunion, reminiscing about the Good Ole Days and that we couldn't believe that 50 had passed. We sang Maybellene, we thought about having a short smoker on the lawn at the Reunion site but decided that we were just too old. We gave each other a huge hug and said, See you soon.  Mike, you will be missed. George Held
