Get comprehensive HR technology and expertise with ADP.
There’s a lot that goes into managing your employees, from running payroll and tracking time to cultivating talent and administering benefits. We’ll help you keep things streamlined, accessible, and easy to manage –so you can focus on what you do best.

Time and Attendance
 


Human Resource Management
 


Benefits Administration
 


Talent Management
 
 

 



Get payroll services for the way you work.

Payroll isn’t just about a paycheck. Labor is likely your biggest cost, and it touches many parts of your business. Do it right with ADP.
Better payroll services mean:

Lower risk of compliance-related issues and penalties
Vast reductions in administrative time, effort, and money
Anytime, anywhere access for HR managers and employees
Increased efficiency across every areas of your business that intersects with payroll




“Not having to worry about payroll really allows us to focus on our core competencies and servicing our customers.”
Brandon McKennon 
Partner, BreezeIT



 



Boost productivity with time and attendance.




ADP’s automated tracking can save 40 minutes per week per manager.
Source: Nucleus Research, K60 Guidebook ADP, October 2010




Tracking time can be a hassle—but it doesn’t have to be. In fact, smart time and labor management lead to better decision-making for your business overall. 
We’ll help you:

Figure out if you have the right number of employees
Control costs through enhanced time and attendance tracking
Accommodate and multi-language workforce
Understand what Health Care Reform means for time and attendance tracking




 



Make HR a strategic part of your business.

By streamlining administrative HR processes, we’ll help you focus on empowering your people, and aligning individual performance to your business objectives.
You’ll get:

Simple HR processes and workflows
Strategies that you can implement today, and protect you for tomorrow
Ways to connect your workforce to your company goals






69% of businesses that migrated from an in-house solution to an outsourced model reported favorable results.
Source: 2011 BlessingWhite Employee Engagement Report, Hewitt Associates






 



Simplify benefits administration for yourself – and your staff.

Benefits should support your overall talent strategy, and simply must stay up-to-date with changing Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations. 
We’ll help you:

Attract the best and the bright with world-class retirement and insurance plans
Achieve higher employee satisfaction through better benefits administration worldwide
Access more affordable benefits for your workforce
Provide an open enrollment experience that’s as easy as online shopping
Reduce the time, energy, and headcount associated with benefits administration
Take control of ACA regulations




“ADP has provided a lot of resources to us in understanding the Affordable Care Act. It’s the information we need in one source – it saves us time trying to research all those subjects we need to understand.”
David Laverentz 
VP Finance and Administration, Kansas City Royals



 



Build a company of superstars with talent management.

Good talent management means looking ahead, removing obstacles, and fostering excellence—no matter how big or small your business is.
Imagine being able to:

Recognize a new hire’s potential before they even start
Spot small holes in your organization’s talent before they become big ones
Chart a course for every employee that aligns with your company’s larger vision
Ensure that your best people grow – and stay – with you
Have a plan and a process for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including succession management






Lost productivity of actively disengaged employees costs the U.S. economy $370 billion annually.

History[edit]
In 1949 Henry Taub founded Automatic Payrolls, Inc. as a manual payroll processing business with his brother Joe Taub. Frank Lautenberg joined the brothers in the company's infancy. In 1952, Lautenberg became Chairman and CEO of the company. In 1957, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), and began using punched card machines, check printing machines, and mainframe computers.[5] ADP went public in 1961 with 300 clients, 125 employees and revenues of approximately US$400,000. The company established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1965 and acquired the pioneering online computer services company Time Sharing Limited (TSL) in 1974. Lautenberg continued in his roles as Chairman and CEO until elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey in 1982.[citation needed]




ADP Business Solutions Center in 2013.


From 1985 onward, ADP’s annual revenues exceeded the $1 billion mark, with paychecks processed for about 20% of the U.S. workforce. In the 1990s, ADP began acting as a professional employer organization (PEO). Around this time, the company acquired Autonom, a German company and the payroll and human resource services company, GSI, headquartered in Paris.[6] In September 1998, ADP acquired UK-based Chessington Computer Centre that supplied administration services to the UK Government.[7]
Kerridge Computer Co. Ltd., a dealer management systems (DMS) provider to auto dealers in the UK was acquired in 2006.[citation needed] In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.[8] On February 27, 2017, Automatic Data Processing Inc. confirmed it was closing its office in west Ann Arbor on March 30, 2017. At the time, ADP stated that it had around 56,000 employees worldwide, and that the year prior it had revenues of $12 billion,[9] or US$11,700,000,000 in 2016.[1] Also in early 2017, ADP described itself as the "largest provider of HR services in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim".[9]
Divisions and spinoffs[edit]
Broadridge Financial Solutions[edit]
In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR), removing about US$2,000,000,000 from ADP's total yearly revenue.[8] ADP distributed one share of Broadridge common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2007.[10]
CDK Global, LLC[edit]




ADP Dealer Services in Ontario


Formerly called ADP Dealer Services, CDK Global was formed October 01, 2014 and provides integrated technology services and solutions to over 27,000 automotive dealerships internationally, as well as vehicle manufacturers.[11] In 2010, ADP acquired the automotive marketing company Cobalt.[12]
BZ Results (Automotive Dealer Services), winner of the 2006 “Innovative Company of the Year”,[13][14] was purchased by ADP in 2006.[15] At the time, BZ Results was valued at $125 million. On April 7, 2014, ADP announced plans to spin off the Dealer Services division as a standalone company.[16] On August 19, 2014, ADP Dealer Services announced that the name of the new company, post-spinoff, would be CDK Global.[17]
Publications[edit]
ADP is the sponsor of the ADP National Employment Report[18] as well as the ADP Small Business Report.[citation needed]
Recognition[edit]

History[edit]
In 1949 Henry Taub founded Automatic Payrolls, Inc. as a manual payroll processing business with his brother Joe Taub. Frank Lautenberg joined the brothers in the company's infancy. In 1952, Lautenberg became Chairman and CEO of the company. In 1957, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), and began using punched card machines, check printing machines, and mainframe computers.[5] ADP went public in 1961 with 300 clients, 125 employees and revenues of approximately US$400,000. The company established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1965 and acquired the pioneering online computer services company Time Sharing Limited (TSL) in 1974. Lautenberg continued in his roles as Chairman and CEO until elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey in 1982.[citation needed]




ADP Business Solutions Center in 2013.


From 1985 onward, ADP’s annual revenues exceeded the $1 billion mark, with paychecks processed for about 20% of the U.S. workforce. In the 1990s, ADP began acting as a professional employer organization (PEO). Around this time, the company acquired Autonom, a German company and the payroll and human resource services company, GSI, headquartered in Paris.[6] In September 1998, ADP acquired UK-based Chessington Computer Centre that supplied administration services to the UK Government.[7]
Kerridge Computer Co. Ltd., a dealer management systems (DMS) provider to auto dealers in the UK was acquired in 2006.[citation needed] In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.[8] On February 27, 2017, Automatic Data Processing Inc. confirmed it was closing its office in west Ann Arbor on March 30, 2017. At the time, ADP stated that it had around 56,000 employees worldwide, and that the year prior it had revenues of $12 billion,[9] or US$11,700,000,000 in 2016.[1] Also in early 2017, ADP described itself as the "largest provider of HR services in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim".[9]
Divisions and spinoffs[edit]
Broadridge Financial Solutions[edit]
In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR), removing about US$2,000,000,000 from ADP's total yearly revenue.[8] ADP distributed one share of Broadridge common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2007.[10]
CDK Global, LLC[edit]




ADP Dealer Services in Ontario


Formerly called ADP Dealer Services, CDK Global was formed October 01, 2014 and provides integrated technology services and solutions to over 27,000 automotive dealerships internationally, as well as vehicle manufacturers.[11] In 2010, ADP acquired the automotive marketing company Cobalt.[12]
BZ Results (Automotive Dealer Services), winner of the 2006 “Innovative Company of the Year”,[13][14] was purchased by ADP in 2006.[15] At the time, BZ Results was valued at $125 million. On April 7, 2014, ADP announced plans to spin off the Dealer Services division as a standalone company.[16] On August 19, 2014, ADP Dealer Services announced that the name of the new company, post-spinoff, would be CDK Global.[17]

History[edit]
In 1949 Henry Taub founded Automatic Payrolls, Inc. as a manual payroll processing business with his brother Joe Taub. Frank Lautenberg joined the brothers in the company's infancy. In 1952, Lautenberg became Chairman and CEO of the company. In 1957, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), and began using punched card machines, check printing machines, and mainframe computers.[5] ADP went public in 1961 with 300 clients, 125 employees and revenues of approximately US$400,000. The company established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1965 and acquired the pioneering online computer services company Time Sharing Limited (TSL) in 1974. Lautenberg continued in his roles as Chairman and CEO until elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey in 1982.[citation needed]

Around this time, the company acquired Autonom, a German company and the payroll and human resource services company, GSI, headquartered in Paris.[6] In September 1998, ADP acquired UK-based Chessington Computer Centre that supplied administration services to the UK Government.[7]
Kerridge Computer Co. Ltd., a dealer management systems (DMS) provider to auto dealers in the UK was acquired in 2006.[citation needed] In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.[8] On February 27, 2017, Automatic Data Processing Inc. confirmed it was closing its office in west Ann Arbor on March 30, 2017. At the time, ADP stated that it had around 56,000 employees worldwide, and that the year prior it had revenues of $12 billion,[9] or US$11,700,000,000 in 2016.[1] Also in early 2017, ADP described itself as the "largest provider of HR services in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim".[9]

Save valuable time
“Running payroll for a small business is a headache. For me to have switched over to ADP, it’s saved…hours and hours every week. It could come out to days a month!”
Chris Bredesen 
                Owner, The Rockefeller and Captain Kidds 



Pay employees promptly
“With [another payroll processor], our employees weren’t getting paid on the day that payroll was due. When we moved back to ADP, it was beyond easy. The transition was great. It was flawless.”
Brandon McKennon 
                Co-Founder/Partner, BreezeIT 



Accurate from the start
“As a small business, we operate in 5 or 6 different states…so there are a lot of requirements for filing taxes in each one. ADP does an excellent job of helping us maintain that.”
Kevin Jennings

Get comprehensive HR technology and expertise with ADP.
There’s a lot that goes into managing your employees, from running payroll and tracking time to cultivating talent and administering benefits. We’ll help you keep things streamlined, accessible, and easy to manage –so you can focus on what you do best.



Payroll Services
 


Time and Attendance
 


Human Resource Management
 


Benefits Administration
 


Talent Management
 
 

 



Get payroll services for the way you work.

Payroll isn’t just about a paycheck. Labor is likely your biggest cost, and it touches many parts of your business. Do it right with ADP.
Better payroll services mean:

Lower risk of compliance-related issues and penalties
Vast reductions in administrative time, effort, and money
Anytime, anywhere access for HR managers and employees
Increased efficiency across every areas of your business that intersects with payroll




“Not having to worry about payroll really allows us to focus on our core competencies and servicing our customers.”
Brandon McKennon 
Partner, BreezeIT



 



Boost productivity with time and attendance.




ADP’s automated tracking can save 40 minutes per week per manager.
Source: Nucleus Research, K60 Guidebook ADP, October 2010




Tracking time can be a hassle—but it doesn’t have to be. In fact, smart time and labor management lead to better decision-making for your business overall. 
We’ll help you:

Figure out if you have the right number of employees
Control costs through enhanced time and attendance tracking
Accommodate and multi-language workforce
Understand what Health Care Reform means for time and attendance tracking




 



Make HR a strategic part of your business.

By streamlining administrative HR processes, we’ll help you focus on empowering your people, and aligning individual performance to your business objectives.
You’ll get:

Simple HR processes and workflows
Strategies that you can implement today, and protect you for tomorrow
Ways to connect your workforce to your company goals






69% of businesses that migrated from an in-house solution to an outsourced model reported favorable results.
Source: 2011 BlessingWhite Employee Engagement Report, Hewitt Associates






 



Simplify benefits administration for yourself – and your staff.

Benefits should support your overall talent strategy, and simply must stay up-to-date with changing Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations. 
We’ll help you:

Attract the best and the bright with world-class retirement and insurance plans
Achieve higher employee satisfaction through better benefits administration worldwide
Access more affordable benefits for your workforce
Provide an open enrollment experience that’s as easy as online shopping
Reduce the time, energy, and headcount associated with benefits administration
Take control of ACA regulations




“ADP has provided a lot of resources to us in understanding the Affordable Care Act. It’s the information we need in one source – it saves us time trying to research all those subjects we need to understand.”
David Laverentz 
VP Finance and Administration, Kansas City Royals



 



Build a company of superstars with talent management.

Good talent management means looking ahead, removing obstacles, and fostering excellence—no matter how big or small your business is.
Imagine being able to:

Recognize a new hire’s potential before they even start
Spot small holes in your organization’s talent before they become big ones
Chart a course for every employee that aligns with your company’s larger vision
Ensure that your best people grow – and stay – with you
Have a plan and a process for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including succession management






Lost productivity of actively disengaged employees costs the U.S. economy $370 billion annually.

ADP was formerly one of four American companies to get a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's,[2][3] but S&P and Moody's downgraded ADP to AA in April 2014, after the dealer services unit was spun off.[4]

History[edit]
In 1949 Henry Taub founded Automatic Payrolls, Inc. as a manual payroll processing business with his brother Joe Taub. Frank Lautenberg joined the brothers in the company's infancy. In 1952, Lautenberg became Chairman and CEO of the company. In 1957, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), and began using punched card machines, check printing machines, and mainframe computers.[5] ADP went public in 1961 with 300 clients, 125 employees and revenues of approximately US$400,000. The company established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1965 and acquired the pioneering online computer services company Time Sharing Limited (TSL) in 1974. Lautenberg continued in his roles as Chairman and CEO until elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey in 1982.[citation needed]




ADP Business Solutions Center in 2013.


From 1985 onward, ADP’s annual revenues exceeded the $1 billion mark, with paychecks processed for about 20% of the U.S. workforce. In the 1990s, ADP began acting as a professional employer organization (PEO). Around this time, the company acquired Autonom, a German company and the payroll and human resource services company, GSI, headquartered in Paris.[6] In September 1998, ADP acquired UK-based Chessington Computer Centre that supplied administration services to the UK Government.[7]
Kerridge Computer Co. Ltd., a dealer management systems (DMS) provider to auto dealers in the UK was acquired in 2006.[citation needed] In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.[8] On February 27, 2017, Automatic Data Processing Inc. confirmed it was closing its office in west Ann Arbor on March 30, 2017. At the time, ADP stated that it had around 56,000 employees worldwide, and that the year prior it had revenues of $12 billion,[9] or US$11,700,000,000 in 2016.[1] Also in early 2017, ADP described itself as the "largest provider of HR services in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim".[9]
Divisions and spinoffs[edit]
Broadridge Financial Solutions[edit]
In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR), removing about US$2,000,000,000 from ADP's total yearly revenue.[8] ADP distributed one share of Broadridge common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2007.[10]
CDK Global, LLC[edit]




ADP Dealer Services in Ontario


Formerly called ADP Dealer Services, CDK Global was formed October 01, 2014 and provides integrated technology services and solutions to over 27,000 automotive dealerships internationally, as well as vehicle manufacturers.[11] In 2010, ADP acquired the automotive marketing company Cobalt.[12]
BZ Results (Automotive Dealer Services), winner of the 2006 “Innovative Company of the Year”,[13][14] was purchased by ADP in 2006.[15] At the time, BZ Results was valued at $125 million. On April 7, 2014, ADP announced plans to spin off the Dealer Services division as a standalone company.[16] On August 19, 2014, ADP Dealer Services announced that the name of the new company, post-spinoff, would be CDK Global.[17]
Publications[edit]
ADP is the sponsor of the ADP National Employment Report[18] as well as the ADP Small Business Report.[citation needed]
Recognition[edit]

In 2010, ADP ranked first on Fortune's list of America’s Most Admired Companies within the Financial Data Services category.[23]
In 2010, ADP was awarded the #2 ranking in the Training Top 125 List by Training magazine. ADP ranked 12th in 2009 and 20th in 2008.[24][25]
In 2011, ADP achieved a 100 percent rating in the Corporate Equality Index (CEI) report.[23]
In 2012, ADP was recently listed as #47 on Computerworld's 19th annual list of the 100 Best Places to Work in IT.[26]

ADP, LLC., is an American provider of human resources management software and services. ADP was formerly one of four American companies to get a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's,[2][3] but S&P and Moody's downgraded ADP to AA in April 2014, after the dealer services unit was spun off.[4]

History[edit]
In 1949 Henry Taub founded Automatic Payrolls, Inc. as a manual payroll processing business with his brother Joe Taub. Frank Lautenberg joined the brothers in the company's infancy. In 1952, Lautenberg became Chairman and CEO of the company. In 1957, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), and began using punched card machines, check printing machines, and mainframe computers.[5] ADP went public in 1961 with 300 clients, 125 employees and revenues of approximately US$400,000. The company established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1965 and acquired the pioneering online computer services company Time Sharing Limited (TSL) in 1974. Lautenberg continued in his roles as Chairman and CEO until elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey in 1982.[citation needed]




ADP Business Solutions Center in 2013.


From 1985 onward, ADP’s annual revenues exceeded the $1 billion mark, with paychecks processed for about 20% of the U.S. workforce. In the 1990s, ADP began acting as a professional employer organization (PEO). Around this time, the company acquired Autonom, a German company and the payroll and human resource services company, GSI, headquartered in Paris.[6] In September 1998, ADP acquired UK-based Chessington Computer Centre that supplied administration services to the UK Government.[7]
Kerridge Computer Co. Ltd., a dealer management systems (DMS) provider to auto dealers in the UK was acquired in 2006.[citation needed] In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.[8] On February 27, 2017, Automatic Data Processing Inc. confirmed it was closing its office in west Ann Arbor on March 30, 2017. At the time, ADP stated that it had around 56,000 employees worldwide, and that the year prior it had revenues of $12 billion,[9] or US$11,700,000,000 in 2016.[1] Also in early 2017, ADP described itself as the "largest provider of HR services in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim".[9]
Divisions and spinoffs[edit]
Broadridge Financial Solutions[edit]
In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR), removing about US$2,000,000,000 from ADP's total yearly revenue.[8] ADP distributed one share of Broadridge common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2007.[10]
CDK Global, LLC[edit]




ADP Dealer Services in Ontario


Formerly called ADP Dealer Services, CDK Global was formed October 01, 2014 and provides integrated technology services and solutions to over 27,000 automotive dealerships internationally, as well as vehicle manufacturers.[11] In 2010, ADP acquired the automotive marketing company Cobalt.[12]
BZ Results (Automotive Dealer Services), winner of the 2006 “Innovative Company of the Year”,[13][14] was purchased by ADP in 2006.[15] At the time, BZ Results was valued at $125 million. On April 7, 2014, ADP announced plans to spin off the Dealer Services division as a standalone company.[16] On August 19, 2014, ADP Dealer Services announced that the name of the new company, post-spinoff, would be CDK Global.[17]
Publications[edit]
ADP is the sponsor of the ADP National Employment Report[18] as well as the ADP Small Business Report.[citation needed]
Recognition[edit]

In 2003, 2004, and 2005, ADP was ranked as one of the top 10 companies in North America, having been AAA/Aaa rated by both S&P and Moody's.[19][20][21]
In 2006, ADP ranked #2 on InformationWeek 500's top 250 Innovators.[22]
In 2009, the Aberdeen Group named ADP as one of the top 25 Most Influential Technology Vendors for 2009.[23]
In 2010, ADP ranked first on Fortune's list of America’s Most Admired Companies within the Financial Data Services category.[23]
In 2010, ADP was awarded the #2 ranking in the Training Top 125 List by Training magazine. ADP ranked 12th in 2009 and 20th in 2008.[24][25]
In 2011, ADP achieved a 100 percent rating in the Corporate Equality Index (CEI) report.[23]
In 2012, ADP was recently listed as #47 on Computerworld's 19th annual list of the 100 Best Places to Work in IT.[26]
In 2016, ADP was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Payroll BPO Services for a fifth consecutive year. [27]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
