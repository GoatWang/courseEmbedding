I just moved into Brookview and I love it.



                                I just moved into Brookview and I love it. The apartment is wonderful. Lisa and the team at Brookview did a wonderful job helping me get settled in. Such a great location with malls and shops close by. The landscaping is lovely and it feels like a peaceful oasis after a long day.

We are vey satisfied.



                                This is a beautiful property. We love our apartment and our neighbors are friendly. The new management has been a welcome and excellent addition.

Loving it!



                                We just moved in about two weeks ago and we love it. From the high ceilings, spacious bedrooms, awesome kitchen and beautifully landscaped property, we have felt right at home in our apartment. This is also a very convenient space for most everything in the Tampa Bay Area. You are about 15 minutes from just about everything. Loving it!

We love the complex



                                We have been here for a few months. We love the complex. It is well maintained. The new management has been helpful and accessible and a welcome change.

I like it



                                I like it. Prompt service if any maintenance needed. I recommend.

This place is great



                                We moved in a short while ago but I can already tell this place is great. The apartments are condo quality and location is very convenient. We had a few service requests upon move in that were addressed very quickly. They actually care if you enjoy living there and that means a lot. I am looking forward to living here and feel good knowing I'm getting really good bang for my buck.

Place is good



                                Location is very convenient for my office travel. Place is good, calm and peace of mind when at home. :)

Tampa






Situated on Florida’s west coast, bordering Tampa Bay and near the Gulf of Mexico, Tampa is the third most populous city in Florida. Tampa residents reap the benefits of a laidback beach lifestyle and the many amenities of a major metropolis.

Renting in Tampa affords you the opportunity to visit world-class attractions such as Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, the Florida Aquarium, Lowry Park Zoo, Tampa Museum of Art, and the Museum of Science and Industry. You can shop national retailers at International Plaza and head over to Ybor City to peruse a variety of boutique and specialty stores. You can see the Tampa Bay Buccaneers score touchdowns at Raymond James Stadium and attend the third largest parade in the country, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival, which draws thousands of visitors every year.

Swing by Tampa’s Riverwalk to stroll along the Hillsborough River and grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants in the area.

Tampa Overview


Off the coast of western Florida sits the city of Tampa, the county seat of Hillsborough County and one of the largest cities in the state. Being a fun city with great weather and plenty to do all year long makes this city a hotbed for living the good life. With a wide variety of options of apartments in Tampa, living here can be the Florida lifestyle you're looking for.






Tampa History


The area was once inhabited by native people known as the Tocobaga and the Pohoy, until they were wiped out by European diseases that were introduced during the 16th century by Spanish explorers. Oddly enough, even as Spain settled the rest of the area, it did not bother to make a permanent settlement over the course of its entire occupation. The land was purchased by the United States in 1819, and it was finally settled by the U.S. Army in 1824. Tampa became incorporated in 1849 and has been growing ever since. The name of the city comes from a word in the Calusa Native American language that means “sticks of fire.”






Tampa Weather


The climate of the area is humid subtropical, which means it contains the humidity found in most of the South, plus the tropical weather found off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The summers are extremely humid and hot, with lots of thunderstorms and the occasional tropical storm. The winters are very mild and mostly dry, although sometimes it can get a bit cold. The spring and the fall are both beautiful, with temperatures in the mid 70s.






Tampa Media


Tampa residents enjoy daily reads of the Tampa Bay Times, formerly the St. Petersburg Times, which has served the city for more than 132 years. Local television stations include all the major broadcast networks, including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS and the CW affiliates located in the city. More than 70 radio stations are in the area, and they feature every type of music, from classic rock to hip-hop and everything in between. In addition, listeners can enjoy educational networks, news networks, talk radio and sports radio.








Tampa Landmarks


Several major landmarks in the area date back to both its pre-Colonial and Colonial past. The Tampa Bay History Center tracks the area’s development over the course of its 12,000 years of history. The largest landmarks in the city are of the man-made variety. Busch Gardens, one of the biggest theme parks outside of Orlando, is home to several different rides and animal exhibits, all of which are based on an African theme.






Things to do in Tampa


The Lowry Park Zoo is another spacious animal sanctuary, with thousands of different animals. Finally, the Florida Aquarium is a massive water sanctuary with more than 20,000 different species of plant and animal life. Because the city is right off the coast, you will have plenty of opportunities to go sailing and boating. The port is home to one of Carnival’s cruise ships and a few others as well. Visitors and residents can also take daily tours on smaller boats to sail around Tampa Bay. If you are a football fan, Tampa is home to the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Outback Bowl, which is part of the “New Year’s Six” set of college football bowls.






Tampa Festivals


"Each year  in late January/early February, Tampa plays hosts to the annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival. It is basically the Tampa version of Mardi Gras, with giant parties, parades and other pirate-themed excitement. Nearly half a million people attend this festival every year.

"






Tampa Vacation spots


If you are looking for a vacation, you should stay in the city and visit one of the theme parks. But if you are looking to travel a bit, don’t be afraid to head over to Orlando, which is just a few hours away. Orlando has both Universal Studios and Disney World, among other amazing theme parks.








Getting Around Tampa


Tampa has a very good public transportation system that includes buses, rail and street cars. The train runs twice daily toward Miami and New York City, and another service provides bus connections to different cities in the area and as far as Orlando. The main city transit offers a variety of bus routes through the whole city, with 30 different routes. The streetcar runs between Ybor City, downtown, and a few points in between. And, of course, Lyft, Uber and other ride-sharing services are available.






Commuting in Tampa


For a major metropolitan city, getting around on your own to and from your Tampa apartments to work and back is not too difficult. Several major highways run in and out of the city, including Interstate 275, State Road 60 and U.S. Highway 92. And three major bridges span the waters to provide transportation out of the city.








Why Here


With its beautiful beaches, warm weather and its thriving economy, Tampa apartments are one of the best locations in the South to live. The crime rate is about the average of the rest of the country, and the unemployment rate is fairly low as well, with median household incomes more than $40,000. The city is incredibly diverse, with a lot of Hispanic culture.






Where to move in Tampa


Tampa has a large diversity of neighborhoods that boast great apartments for rent. In total, you can choose from more than 80 neighborhoods, ranging from modern neighborhoods with insular, contemporary designs, to historic neighborhoods with Victorian architecture. Some neighborhoods sit at the higher end of the price scale, while others areas of the city offer very affordable Tampa apartments. One of the more unique neighborhoods in the city is Ybor City. Founded by cigar manufacturers, the Ybor City neighborhood is filled with immigrant families from Cuba, Spain and Italy. It is extremely diverse, with amazing restaurants and night life. Another great neighborhood, the West Tampa area, is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, and it’s only a mile or two from downtown. The neighborhood has an authentic “old Spanish” feel to it, with beautiful areas reminiscent of the late 18th century in Spain. The region is currently going through a major redevelopment.

I just moved into Brookview and I love it.



                                I just moved into Brookview and I love it. The apartment is wonderful. Lisa and the team at Brookview did a wonderful job helping me get settled in. Such a great location with malls and shops close by. The landscaping is lovely and it feels like a peaceful oasis after a long day.

We are vey satisfied.



                                This is a beautiful property. We love our apartment and our neighbors are friendly. The new management has been a welcome and excellent addition.

Loving it!



                                We just moved in about two weeks ago and we love it. From the high ceilings, spacious bedrooms, awesome kitchen and beautifully landscaped property, we have felt right at home in our apartment. This is also a very convenient space for most everything in the Tampa Bay Area. You are about 15 minutes from just about everything. Loving it!

We love the complex



                                We have been here for a few months. We love the complex. It is well maintained. The new management has been helpful and accessible and a welcome change.

I like it



                                I like it. Prompt service if any maintenance needed. I recommend.

This place is great



                                We moved in a short while ago but I can already tell this place is great. The apartments are condo quality and location is very convenient. We had a few service requests upon move in that were addressed very quickly. They actually care if you enjoy living there and that means a lot. I am looking forward to living here and feel good knowing I'm getting really good bang for my buck.

Place is good



                                Location is very convenient for my office travel. Place is good, calm and peace of mind when at home. :)

Tampa






Situated on Florida’s west coast, bordering Tampa Bay and near the Gulf of Mexico, Tampa is the third most populous city in Florida. Tampa residents reap the benefits of a laidback beach lifestyle and the many amenities of a major metropolis.
