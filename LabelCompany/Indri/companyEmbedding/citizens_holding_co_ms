The Citizens Holding Company - Timeline








Citizens Holding Company


Timeline
	In 1908 forty-eight (48) individuals set out to make banking a reality in the small sleepy town of Philadelphia, Mississippi located in the heart of Neshoba County. These visionaries together worked to form the town’s very first national bank by applying for a national bank charter. These forty-eight individuals became the bank’s first stockholders raising capital in the amount of $50,000.00 and a $5,000.00 surplus to open the doors of what was then known as The First National Bank.	The currency used as legal tender during the bank’s early years was printed in-house at the First National Bank and issued under the bank’s name.	1914 the bank’s Resources were $240,686.91.	1917 the stockholders’ made a decision to surrender its national bank charter and file for a state charter and change the name from First National Bank to The Citizens Bank. This milestone was the beginning of greater things to come. On June 17, 1917 an article in the local newspaper stated the following; “Largest capital and surplus of any bank in this section of the state. Same management, just new in name with all the environments thrown around to make a good banking institution, ever ready to help in the up building of our county and state.”	1918 the bank urged individuals to purchase War Savings Stamps on or before June 28, 1918 in support of the World War I war effort. The local newspaper ran the following bank ad, “Now we have sent your boy or your neighbor’s boy out into a foreign land, into terror that he cannot know and his faith has not faltered. He knows we will do our part if he does his. Pledge yourself to buy War Savings Stamps”.	December 31, 1918 the bank’s resources totaled $655,038.62 and the bank was paying 4% on time deposits.	February 2, 1923 a statement of conditions recorded that The Citizens Bank’s resources and liabilities were at $971,750.45. The management leaders boasted that the bank was fast approaching the million dollar mark and was the leading bank in this section of Mississippi	May 23, 1930 the local paper recorded the continued progress and visions of the bank’s financial leaders of the era. An article in the paper stated, “In the past ten years, the population of Philadelphia has increased by fifty-two percent. That we have kept the pace with this advancement is evidenced by the fact that our deposits have increased by sixty-seven percent. We have not only anticipated the increasing banking needs for Philadelphia but for the entire community we serve”.	In the early 1960’s the banks management and stockholders’ envisioned another opportunity to grow its company by investing in property to build a new banking facility. In 1965 this vision became a reality. A brand new state of the art three story banking facility was under construction.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Quarterly Report") contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements and information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are based on management's beliefs, plans, expectations and assumptions and on information currently available to management. The words "may," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "continue," "believe," "seek," "estimate" and similar expressions used in this Quarterly Report that do not relate to historical facts are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements appear in a number of places in this Quarterly Report. The Corporation notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results or experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations described or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Table of Contents  The Corporation does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report, or if earlier, the date on which such statements were made.  Table of Contents  Management's discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater insight into the results of operations and the financial condition of Citizens Holding Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia (the "Bank," and collectively with Citizens Holding Company, the "Corporation"). The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  OVERVIEW  The Company is a one-bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on February 16, 1982. The Company is the sole shareholder of The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia ("Bank"). The Company does not have any subsidiaries other than the Bank.  The Bank was opened on February 8, 1908 as The First National Bank of Philadelphia. In 1917, the Bank surrendered its national charter and obtained a state charter, at which time the name of the Bank was changed to The Citizens Bank of Philadelphia, Mississippi. At March 31, 2017, the Bank was the largest bank headquartered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, with total assets of $1.048 billion and total deposits of $789.2 million  The principal executive offices of both the Company and the Bank are located at 521 Main Street, Philadelphia, Mississippi 39350, and the main telephone number is (601) 656-4692. All references hereinafter to the activities or operations of the Company reflect the Company's activities or operations through the Bank.  LIQUIDITY  The Corporation has an asset and liability management program that assists management in maintaining net interest margins during times of both rising and falling interest rates and in maintaining sufficient liquidity. A measurement of liquidity is the ratio of net deposits and short-term liabilities divided by the sum of net cash, short-term investments and marketable assets. This measurement for liquidity of the Corporation at March 31, 2017, was 39.23% and at December 31, 2016, was 37.64%. The increase was due to an increase in short term marketable assets at March 31, 2017. Management believes it maintains adequate liquidity for the Corporation's current needs.  The Corporation's primary source of liquidity is customer deposits, which were $789,214,876 at March 31, 2017, and $760,152,340 at December 31, 2016. Other sources of liquidity include investment securities, the Corporation's line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") and federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Corporation had $489,941,021 invested in available-for-sale investment securities at March 31, 2017, and $496,124,574 at December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to matured or called funds in the available-for-sale classification not being fully re-invested. The Corporation also had $73,714,719 in interest bearing deposits at other banks at March 31, 2017 and $48,603,182 at December 31, 2016. The increase in interest bearing deposits was the result of long term investments being called or matured. The Corporation had secured and unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks in the amount of $45,000,000 at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In  Table of Contents  addition, the Corporation has the ability to draw on its line of credit with the FHLB. At March 31, 2017, the Corporation had unused and available $94,291,995 of its line of credit with the FHLB and at December 31, 2016, the Corporation had unused and available $123,592,789 of its line of credit with the FHLB. The decrease in the amount available under the Corporation's line of credit with the FHLB from the end of 2016 to March 31, 2017, was the result of a decrease in the amount of loans eligible for the collateral pool securing the Corporation's line of credit with the FHLB. The Corporation had no federal funds purchased as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Corporation may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks on a temporary basis to meet short term funding needs.  When the Corporation has more funds than it needs for its reserve requirements or short-term liquidity needs, the Corporation increases its investment portfolio, increases the balances in interest bearing due from bank accounts or sells federal funds. It is management's policy to maintain an adequate portion of its portfolio of assets and liabilities on a short-term basis to insure rate flexibility and to meet loan funding and liquidity needs. When deposits decline or do not grow sufficiently to fund loan demand, management will seek funding either through federal funds purchased or advances from the FHLB.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  Total shareholders' equity was $88,218,142 at March 31, 2107, as compared to $85,059,395 at December 31, 2016. The increase in shareholders' equity was the result of a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss brought about by the investment securities market value adjustment as well as the increase in the amount of earnings in excess of dividends paid. The market value adjustment, which was an increase was due to general market conditions, specifically the decrease in medium term interest rates, which caused an increase in the market price of the Corporation's investment portfolio.  The Corporation paid aggregate cash dividends in the amount of $1,172,899, or $0.24 per share, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.24 per share for the same period in 2016.  Table of Contents  Quantitative measures established by federal regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (primarily common stock and retained earnings, less goodwill) to risk weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that as of March 31, 2017, the Corporation meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and according to these requirements the Corporation is considered to be well capitalized.   Minimum Capital Minimum Capital Requirement to be Requirement to be Adequately Actual Well Capitalized Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio March 31, 2017 Citizens Holding Company Tier 1 leverage ratio $ 93,026 9.34 % $ 49,803 5.00 % $ 39,842 4.00 % Common Equity tier 1 capital ratio 93,026 9.34 % 64,744 6.50 % 44,823 4.50 % Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 93,026 17.88 % 41,633 8.00 % 31,225 6.00 % Total risk-based capital ratio 96,728 18.59 % 52,041 10.00 % 41,633 8.00 % December 31, 2016 Citizens Holding Company Tier 1 leverage ratio $ 92,629 9.22 % $ 50,258 5.00 % $ 40,207 4.00 % Common Equity tier 1 capital ratio 92,629 9.22 % 65,336 6.50 % 45,232 4.50 % Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 92,629 17.92 % 41,354 8.00 % 31,016 6.00 % Total risk-based capital ratio 96,532 18.67 % 51,693 10.00 % 41,354 8.00 %  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to adopt regulations imposing a continuing "floor" on the risk based capital requirements. In December 2010, the Basel Committee released a final framework for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as "Basel III". In early July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules relevant to us: (1) the Basel III regulatory capital reforms; and (2) the "standardized approach of Basel II for non-core banks and bank holding companies", such as the Bank and the Company. The capital framework under Basel III will replace the existing regulatory capital rules for all banks, savings associations and U.S. bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in total assets, and all savings and loan holding companies.  Beginning January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank were required to comply with the final Basel III rules, although the rules will not be fully phased-in until January 1, 2019. Among other things, the final Basel III rules will impact regulatory capital ratios of banking organizations in the following manner, when fully phased-in:   Create a new requirement to maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of not less than 4.5%;   Increase the minimum leverage capital ratio to 4% for all banking organizations (currently 3% for certain banking organizations);   Increase the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4% to 6%; and   Maintain the minimum total risk-based capital ratio at 8%.  In addition, the final Basel III rules, when fully phased-in, will subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization did not maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2.5% of its total risk-weighted assets. The effect of the capital conservation buffer, when fully phased-in, will be to increase the minimum common  Table of Contents  equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7%, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio to 8.5% and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5% for banking organizations seeking to avoid the limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  The final Basel III rules also changed the capital categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of prompt corrective action. Under the final rules, to be well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a leverage capital ratio of at least 5%. In addition, the final Basel III rules established more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital and imposed certain deductions from and adjustments to the measure of common equity Tier 1 capital.  Management believes that, as of March 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III and the banking agencies' proposals on a fully phased-in basis, if such requirements were currently effective. The changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets required by Basel III did not have a material impact on the Corporation's capital ratios as presented. Management will continue to monitor these and any future proposals submitted by the Corporation's and Bank's regulators.  Table of Contents  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain items in the consolidated statements of income of the Corporation and the related changes between those periods: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Interest Income, including fees $ 7,469,077 $ 7,579,734 Interest Expense 807,447 769,060 Net Interest Income 6,661,630 6,810,674 Provision for Loan Losses (151,220 ) 60,498 Net Interest Income after Provision for Loan Losses 6,812,850 6,750,176 Other Income 1,934,260 1,815,688 Other Expense 7,109,156 6,644,315 Income Before Provision For Income Taxes 1,637,954 1,921,549 Provision for Income Taxes 200,629 395,379 Net Income $ 1,437,325 $ 1,526,170 Net Income Per share - Basic $ 0.29 $ 0.31 Net Income Per Share-Diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.31  See Note 3 to the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation regarding the Corporation's calculation of Net Income Per Share - basic and - diluted.  Annualized return on average equity ("ROE") was 6.67% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 7.69% for the corresponding period in 2016.  Book value per share increased to $18.05 at March 31, 2017, compared to $17.42 at December 31, 2016. The increase in book value per share reflects the amount of earnings in excess of dividends and a decrease in other comprehensive loss due to the increase in fair value of the Corporation's investment securities. Average assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were $999,205,548 compared to $996,266,145 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due mainly to an increase in interest bearing due from bank accounts offset by a decrease in available-for-sale securities.  Table of Contents  NET INTEREST INCOME / NET INTEREST MARGIN  One component of the Corporation's earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid for deposits and borrowed funds. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.  The annualized net interest margin was 3.03% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.12% for the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease in net interest margin for the period ended March 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, was the result of the decrease in yields on earning assets and a small increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, as detailed below. Earning assets averaged $918,570,792 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $17,581,088, or 2.0%, over average earning assets of $900,989,704 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in average earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017, is the result of an increase in interest bearing due from bank accounts offset by a decrease in loans and investment securities.  Interest bearing deposits averaged $618,886,173 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $600,804, or 0.1%, from the average of interest bearing deposits of $618,285,369 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This was due, in large part, to an increase in interest-bearing NOW, money market accounts and savings accounts partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit.  Other borrowed funds averaged $140,424,252 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $17,710,173, or 14.4%, over the other borrowed funds of $122,714,079 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase in other borrowed funds was due to a $17,730,133 increase in the securities sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by a $13,367 decrease in the Agribusiness Enterprise Loan Liability and a $6,593 decrease in Federal Funds Purchased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Net interest income was $6,661,630 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $202,697 from $6,810,674 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates paid on earning assets partially offset by an increase in earning assets. The changes in volume in earning assets and in deposits and in borrowed funds are discussed above. As for changes in interest rates in the three months ended March 31, 2017, the yields on earning assets decreased and the rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds increased from the same period in 2016. The yield on all interest-bearing assets decreased 8 basis points to 3.38% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 3.46% for the same period in 2016. At the same time, the rate paid on all interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased 2 basis points to 0.43% from 0.41% in the same period in 2016. As longer term interest bearing assets and liabilities mature and reprice, management believes that the yields on interest bearing assets and rates on interest bearing liabilities will both increase.  Table of Contents  The following table shows the interest and fees and corresponding yields for loans only.   For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 Interest and Fees $ 4,568,079 $ 4,784,505 Average Gross Loans 394,251,976 419,804,332 Annualized Yield 4.63 % 4.56 %  The increase in interest rates on loan accounts in the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflects the increase in all loan interest rates for both new and refinanced loans in the period.  CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE  As a natural corollary to the Corporation's lending activities, some loan losses are to be expected. The risk of loss varies with the type of loan being made and the overall creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan. The degree of perceived risk is taken into account in establishing the structure of, and interest rates and security for, specific loans and for various types of loans. The Corporation attempts to minimize its credit risk exposure by use of thorough loan application and approval procedures.  The Corporation maintains a program of systematic review of its existing loans. Loans are graded for their overall quality. Those loans, which management determines require further monitoring and supervision, are segregated and reviewed on a regular basis. Significant problem loans are reviewed monthly by the Corporation's management and Board of Directors.  The Corporation charges off that portion of any loan that the Corporation's management and Board of Directors has determined to be a loss. A loan is generally considered by management to represent a loss, in whole or in part, when exposure beyond the collateral value is apparent, servicing of the unsecured portion has been discontinued or collection is not anticipated based on the borrower's financial condition. The general economic conditions in the borrower's industry influence this determination. The principal amount of any loan that is declared a loss is charged against the Corporation's allowance for loan losses.  The Corporation's allowance for loan losses is designed to provide for loan losses that can be reasonably anticipated. The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to operating expenses in the form of provisions for loan losses. Actual loan losses or recoveries are charged or credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Board of Directors determines the amount of the allowance. Among the factors considered in determining the allowance for loan losses are the current financial condition of the Corporation's borrowers and the value of security, if any, for their loans. Estimates of future economic conditions and their impact on various industries and individual borrowers are also taken into consideration, as are the Corporation's historical loan loss experience and reports of banking regulatory authorities. As these estimates, factors and evaluations are primarily judgmental, no assurance can be given as to whether the Corporation will sustain loan losses in excess or below its allowance or that subsequent evaluation of the loan portfolio may not require material increases or decreases in such allowance.  Table of Contents  The following table summarizes the Corporation's allowance for loan losses for the dates indicated:   Quarter Ended Year Ended Amount of Percent of March 31, December 31, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Decrease) BALANCES: Gross Loans $ 393,333,257 $ 394,051,139 $ (717,882 ) -0.18 % Allowance for Loan Losses 3,701,914 3,902,796 (200,882 ) -5.15 % Nonaccrual Loans 8,986,666 8,879,393 107,273 1.21 % Ratios: Allowance for loan losses to gross loans 0.94 % 0.99 % Net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses 1.34 % 64.21 %  The provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was negative $151,220, a decrease of $211,718 from the $60,498 provision for the same period in 2016. The change in the Corporation's loan loss provisions for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is a result of management's assessment of inherent loss in the loan portfolio, including the impact caused by current local, national and international economic conditions. The Corporation's model used to calculate the provision is based on the percentage of historical charge-offs applied to the current loan balances by loan segment and specific reserves applied to certain impaired loans. Nonaccrual loans decreased during this period due to the amount of payments received and loans charged off in excess of new loans being added to the nonaccrual loan list.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net loan losses charged to the allowance for loan losses totaled $49,663, a decrease of $1,475,796 from the $1,525,459 charged off in the same period in 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a charge off in 2016 on a single loan in the amount of $1,523,401 on commercial real estate for which the Corporation had previously provided a specific reserve against this loss through the provision for loan loss.  Management reviews quarterly with the Corporation's Board of Directors the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The loan loss provision is adjusted when specific items reflect a need for such an adjustment. Management believes that there were no material loan losses during the three months ended March 31, 2017 that have not been charged off. Management also believes that the Corporation's allowance will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. However, it remains possible that additional provisions for loan loss may be required.  Table of Contents  OTHER INCOME  . . .  May 10, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

The Citizens Holding Company - Timeline








Citizens Holding Company


Timeline
	In 1908 forty-eight (48) individuals set out to make banking a reality in the small sleepy town of Philadelphia, Mississippi located in the heart of Neshoba County. These visionaries together worked to form the town’s very first national bank by applying for a national bank charter. These forty-eight individuals became the bank’s first stockholders raising capital in the amount of $50,000.00 and a $5,000.00 surplus to open the doors of what was then known as The First National Bank.	The currency used as legal tender during the bank’s early years was printed in-house at the First National Bank and issued under the bank’s name.	1914 the bank’s Resources were $240,686.91.	1917 the stockholders’ made a decision to surrender its national bank charter and file for a state charter and change the name from First National Bank to The Citizens Bank.
