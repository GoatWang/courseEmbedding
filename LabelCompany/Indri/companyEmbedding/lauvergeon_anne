Education and career[edit]
Born in Dijon, Côte-d'Or, in 1956 she attended the École normale de jeunes filles to pass the Agrégation in physics. Then she entered the Corps des Mines. In 1983 she enrolled in her first vocational course with the Corps de Mines, in the iron and steel industry, at Usinor. A second vocational course, in 1984, took place with the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, where she studied chemical safety in Europe. From 1985 to 1988, she was with the l'Inspection générale des carrières (IGC). In 1990, she was placed in charge of the mission for the international economy and foreign trade by French President François Mitterrand. The following year, she became assistant secretary general. She was then named "sherpa", i.e. personal representative to the president, and responsible for preparing international meetings such as the G7 summit. In 1995, she joined the banking sector, and became a managing partner of Lazard. In March 1997, she was appointed general director of Alcatel, before becoming part of the group's executive committee.
Leadership in nuclear power[edit]
In June 1999, she was appointed CEO of the group Cogema, succeeding Jean Syrota, who resigned under pressure from The Greens. In July 2001, she merged Cogema, Framatome and other companies to create Areva. At the head of the new company, she became a member the small circle of women directing international corporations. The 2006 Fortune Global 500, published by the American magazine Fortune, ranked her as the 2nd most powerful woman in Europe, behind Patricia Russo, future president of Alcatel-Lucent Technologies.
In 2001, Roger-Gérard Schwartzenberg chose her to chair the "national contest of assistance the creation of companies of innovating technologies".
In September 2002, the daily economic newspaper Les Échos uncovered a report from the French court of auditors, citing her compensation (salary of €305,000 with bonus of €122,000) and "golden parachute" of two years' wages.[citation needed]
Towards the end of 2006, Areva encountered difficulties with its new European Pressurized Reactor and announced an expected delay of eighteen months to three years for its delivery, according to the French daily newspaper La Tribune.[2] The reactor is to be the first of its kind in Finland. The delay may cost €700 million.[3]
Lauvergeon is also President of the board of directors of École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy[4] and is a director or board member of Suez, Total S.A., Safran S.A. and Vodafone.[5][6][7][8]
On 10 July 2008, in the French economic paper "Challenges," she stated: "Uranium is a main part of our success. Our model is... Nespresso: we sell coffee machines and the coffee that fits them. And coffee is very profitable. So in China, we sold two nuclear islands, plus 35% of our uranium production. This is our integrated business model".[9]
On 16 October 2009, Lauvergeon addressed journalists outside the "Women’s Forum" organised in Deauville. She declared: "To be clear, with same competences, sorry, we will choose the woman or something else rather than the white male." She said these words during the France 2 evening news.[10][11][12] This statement generated reaction and was chosen as an example by Éric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen to explain that positive discrimination was a kind of racism.
In June 2010, she was attended the Bilderberg conference in Sitges, Spain.[13] She is a member of the Trilateral Commission as well.[14]
On 16 June 2011 François Fillon, the French Prime minister, announced that Anne Lauvergeon's mandate as head of Areva, terminating end of June 2011, would not be renewed. She was replaced by Luc Oursel, member of the Areva board of management since 2007.[15]
In July 2011 Lauvergeon was elected an International Fellow by the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK.[16]
International recognition[edit]
In 2009, she was ranked by Forbes magazine as the ninth-most powerful woman in the world.[17]

Education and career[edit]
Born in Dijon, Côte-d'Or, in 1956 she attended the École normale de jeunes filles to pass the Agrégation in physics. Then she entered the Corps des Mines. In 1983 she enrolled in her first vocational course with the Corps de Mines, in the iron and steel industry, at Usinor. A second vocational course, in 1984, took place with the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, where she studied chemical safety in Europe. From 1985 to 1988, she was with the l'Inspection générale des carrières (IGC). In 1990, she was placed in charge of the mission for the international economy and foreign trade by French President François Mitterrand. The following year, she became assistant secretary general. She was then named "sherpa", i.e. personal representative to the president, and responsible for preparing international meetings such as the G7 summit. In 1995, she joined the banking sector, and became a managing partner of Lazard. In March 1997, she was appointed general director of Alcatel, before becoming part of the group's executive committee.
Leadership in nuclear power[edit]
In June 1999, she was appointed CEO of the group Cogema, succeeding Jean Syrota, who resigned under pressure from The Greens. In July 2001, she merged Cogema, Framatome and other companies to create Areva. At the head of the new company, she became a member the small circle of women directing international corporations. The 2006 Fortune Global 500, published by the American magazine Fortune, ranked her as the 2nd most powerful woman in Europe, behind Patricia Russo, future president of Alcatel-Lucent Technologies.
In 2001, Roger-Gérard Schwartzenberg chose her to chair the "national contest of assistance the creation of companies of innovating technologies".
In September 2002, the daily economic newspaper Les Échos uncovered a report from the French court of auditors, citing her compensation (salary of €305,000 with bonus of €122,000) and "golden parachute" of two years' wages.[citation needed]
Towards the end of 2006, Areva encountered difficulties with its new European Pressurized Reactor and announced an expected delay of eighteen months to three years for its delivery, according to the French daily newspaper La Tribune.[2] The reactor is to be the first of its kind in Finland. The delay may cost €700 million.[3]
Lauvergeon is also President of the board of directors of École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy[4] and is a director or board member of Suez, Total S.A., Safran S.A. and Vodafone.[5][6][7][8]
On 10 July 2008, in the French economic paper "Challenges," she stated: "Uranium is a main part of our success. Our model is... Nespresso: we sell coffee machines and the coffee that fits them. And coffee is very profitable. So in China, we sold two nuclear islands, plus 35% of our uranium production. This is our integrated business model".[9]
On 16 October 2009, Lauvergeon addressed journalists outside the "Women’s Forum" organised in Deauville. She declared: "To be clear, with same competences, sorry, we will choose the woman or something else rather than the white male." She said these words during the France 2 evening news.[10][11][12] This statement generated reaction and was chosen as an example by Éric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen to explain that positive discrimination was a kind of racism.
In June 2010, she was attended the Bilderberg conference in Sitges, Spain.[13] She is a member of the Trilateral Commission as well.[14]
On 16 June 2011 François Fillon, the French Prime minister, announced that Anne Lauvergeon's mandate as head of Areva, terminating end of June 2011, would not be renewed. She was replaced by Luc Oursel, member of the Areva board of management since 2007.[15]
In July 2011 Lauvergeon was elected an International Fellow by the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK.[16]
International recognition[edit]
In 2009, she was ranked by Forbes magazine as the ninth-most powerful woman in the world.[17]

Education and career[edit]
Born in Dijon, Côte-d'Or, in 1956 she attended the École normale de jeunes filles to pass the Agrégation in physics. Then she entered the Corps des Mines. In 1983 she enrolled in her first vocational course with the Corps de Mines, in the iron and steel industry, at Usinor. A second vocational course, in 1984, took place with the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, where she studied chemical safety in Europe. From 1985 to 1988, she was with the l'Inspection générale des carrières (IGC). In 1990, she was placed in charge of the mission for the international economy and foreign trade by French President François Mitterrand. The following year, she became assistant secretary general. She was then named "sherpa", i.e. personal representative to the president, and responsible for preparing international meetings such as the G7 summit. In 1995, she joined the banking sector, and became a managing partner of Lazard. In March 1997, she was appointed general director of Alcatel, before becoming part of the group's executive committee.
Leadership in nuclear power[edit]
In June 1999, she was appointed CEO of the group Cogema, succeeding Jean Syrota, who resigned under pressure from The Greens. In July 2001, she merged Cogema, Framatome and other companies to create Areva. At the head of the new company, she became a member the small circle of women directing international corporations. The 2006 Fortune Global 500, published by the American magazine Fortune, ranked her as the 2nd most powerful woman in Europe, behind Patricia Russo, future president of Alcatel-Lucent Technologies.
In 2001, Roger-Gérard Schwartzenberg chose her to chair the "national contest of assistance the creation of companies of innovating technologies".
In September 2002, the daily economic newspaper Les Échos uncovered a report from the French court of auditors, citing her compensation (salary of €305,000 with bonus of €122,000) and "golden parachute" of two years' wages.[citation needed]
Towards the end of 2006, Areva encountered difficulties with its new European Pressurized Reactor and announced an expected delay of eighteen months to three years for its delivery, according to the French daily newspaper La Tribune.[2] The reactor is to be the first of its kind in Finland. The delay may cost €700 million.[3]
Lauvergeon is also President of the board of directors of École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy[4] and is a director or board member of Suez, Total S.A., Safran S.A. and Vodafone.[5][6][7][8]
On 10 July 2008, in the French economic paper "Challenges," she stated: "Uranium is a main part of our success. Our model is... Nespresso: we sell coffee machines and the coffee that fits them. And coffee is very profitable. So in China, we sold two nuclear islands, plus 35% of our uranium production. This is our integrated business model".[9]
On 16 October 2009, Lauvergeon addressed journalists outside the "Women’s Forum" organised in Deauville. She declared: "To be clear, with same competences, sorry, we will choose the woman or something else rather than the white male." She said these words during the France 2 evening news.[10][11][12] This statement generated reaction and was chosen as an example by Éric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen to explain that positive discrimination was a kind of racism.
In June 2010, she was attended the Bilderberg conference in Sitges, Spain.[13] She is a member of the Trilateral Commission as well.[14]
On 16 June 2011 François Fillon, the French Prime minister, announced that Anne Lauvergeon's mandate as head of Areva, terminating end of June 2011, would not be renewed. She was replaced by Luc Oursel, member of the Areva board of management since 2007.[15]
In July 2011 Lauvergeon was elected an International Fellow by the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK.[16]
International recognition[edit]
In 2009, she was ranked by Forbes magazine as the ninth-most powerful woman in the world.[17]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
