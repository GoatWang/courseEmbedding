ENFJs are interested in other people & radiate authenticity, concern & altruism. Those who surround the ENFJ usually find them very inspiring and likeable. ENFJs are very charismatic & eloquent, finding it natural and easy to communicate their ideas & opinions, especially in person. It does not really matter whether they are presenting cold facts or expressing raging emotions, the ENFJ will not be afraid to stand up & speak, regardless of the audience. This is one of the reasons why ENFJs can be so convincing & mesmerizing when they speak they instinctively know how to combine passion & rational arguments, drawing the audience’s attention & reaching every mind. People with this personality type can be great leaders & they do not necessarily have to get into politics to make a difference. An ENFJ teacher or a coach can have a strong positive effect on many people’s lives as well. ENFJ personalities are very intuitive. They find it easy to sense other people’s motives & find connections between seemingly unrelated events. ENFJs also tend to be quite good at analyzing their own feelings & questioning them if necessary. On the other hand, such intuitiveness & sensitivity can also cause significant difficulties for people with this personality type they may be too altruistic & empathic, getting too involved in other people’s problems then finding it difficult to detach & stop worrying. In extreme cases, this can even affect the ENFJs’ perception of themselves. ENFJs are optimistic idealists, often trusting other people more than they should although this usually turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As already mentioned above, ENFJs can be very convincing & inspiring. People are drawn towards strong personalities & the ENFJ’s charisma can often be a uniting and motivating factor.Authors: David GallowaySkillsProduct ManagementAccount ManagementKey Account ManagementSales&MarketingSales ManagementNew Business DevelopmentSalesMarketingSales OperationsForecastingTrade ShowsBrand DevelopmentAdvertisingDirect SalesCompetitive AnalysisSee 23+PricingRetailNegotiationProduct DevelopmentSolution SellingMerchandisingB2BP&L ManagementMarket PlanningManagementCustomer ServiceKey Account DevelopmentMarketing StrategyConsumer ProductsInventory ManagementE-commercePurchasingBusiness DevelopmentProduct MarketingCRMLeadershipCold CallingSellingSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationWestern Kentucky UniversityBachelor of Science (B.S.), Business Administration and Management, GeneralBachelor of Science (B.S.), Business Administration and Management, General1983  –  1988RecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about David:David Galloway is the equivalent of integrity.

It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View David’s Full ProfileSummaryI have a BSc in Chemistry followed by a self funded postgraduate Masters in Analytical Chemistry. This has given me a strong base to move forward and attain the goals and dreams that I have. I consider myself to be an analytically minded person with strong hands on abilities. I like to be challenged in life and feel a drive to do the best I can in any situation. After my studies I immediately got a job at Severn Trent Services in a microbiology lab. This was very different to the training I have received at university and required a steep learning curve. Within a short time I had got to the stage of setting up in the morning and even training new members of staff. I then moved to Eli Lilly in Surrey where I started a completely different challenge. Myself and one other colleague setup a pilot laboratory to purify target compound. With limited training from a colleague in the US running a similar service, the laboratory was constantly evolving where ideas to improve the service were implemented. I then moved back to the midlands where I started at Biffa as a site chemist on a hazardous waste treatment plant. This was more in line with what trained to do. My primary job was to analysis waste that could be treated in the plant to ensure it was compatible. This was then compared to the waste once it arrived on site to ensure it was the same waste stream.

From new treatment techniques to investigating accidents and machine breakdowns.•Recently redesigned the quaintly control documents for the laboratory with the aim to save time and provide better results that are easier to access by everyone. This has had a further benifit of providing better traceability of results and key performance data.Purification Chemist (contractor)Eli Lilly and CompanyApril 2011  –  November 2011 (8 months)•Set up a pilot laboratory by mirroring work started in a US. A facility purifying samples, using flash chromatography. The US model worked as a basis but needed modifying to function in the UK.•Setting up flash chromatography runs on state of the art Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash Rf 200.•Helped to develop core working procedures used by the lab. Then reviewing them as the lab evolved past its initial concept•Using LC-MS to asses which fractions have the desired compound and then combining them, then finally analysing the purity of the final product. •Discussing potential method improvements for purifications with medicinal chemists. As these chemists were the customers, if they were not happy the service would have ultimately failed•Setting up the lab included ordering relevant glassware and other important equipment. •Devised recovery procedures to test machines were working at their best.•Running TLC’s to find the best conditions for less important sample when work load is low to boost productivity. This ensured there was minimal down time. •Developing good GLP and GMP. Working with many harmful solvents and compounds.•Left to work independently and with minimal contact with management.Microbiologist (contractor)Severn Trent ServicesOctober 2010  –  April 2011 (7 months)Coventry, United Kingdom•Working as a Microbiologist within the analytical branch of Severn Trent Service testing for legionella from water samples taken all over the UK.•Working to the method setup and approved according to the labs UKAS accredited.•Using the highest accuracy with daily calibrations. •Daily lab testing for contamination and Quality controls to ensure the method is always working.•Developing GMP and GLP techniques.•Saved over £15,000 in costs due to forward thinking by repair and cleaning lab equipment that otherwise would have been thrown away.General AssistantTheAntsNest.co.ukApril 2005  –  September 2010 (5 years 6 months)Coventry, United Kingdom•General Assistant, Production of high quality screen printed nameplates, trims and domed labels. •Making new materials by combining different sheet material with version adhesives. •Mixing ink to pantone colours.  •During high through put periods took control of the manufacturing prioritising the work so customers got the product in a timely fashion.

Ordered components to build 15 computers with spares. This project came under budget and above expectations.•Project working on the production of a UV-curing resin to replace the standard resin. This involved finding a recipe that was easy to reproduce with ingratiated within a price range.

This project was on an environmental analysis testing various water and soil samples taken from around the university and the surrounding area. Testing for a variety of compounds using many different techniques. Dissertation undertaken in “Formation of Transparent and Conductive Films”, which involved Pickering emulsion polymerisation and depositing silver onto the polymer nano-particles.

We rised money by doing sponsed events, monthly carboot sale and car washing. During this time I also aquired a pottery kiln. I rebuild in from the ground up then started to make and sell hand made chess sets with a etched glass board.This expedition involved leading the group while helping a local community renovate a communal building with the hope to allow the community to become more accessible to the wider world.

Biography
Dr Galloway is an epistemologist, with special interests in epistemic rationality, scepticism, and a priori knowledge. He also has interests in ethics, and in Descartes. After an early career in music, he studied the MPhil at King's and then a PhD at MIT, with a thesis on Hilbert's Programme. In recent years much of his time has gone into developing a broad initiative involving the Department of Philosophy and the School of Medicine.

Research interests and PhD supervision

Epistemology, especially epistemic rationality, scepticism and a priori knowledge
Ethics
Descartes

Dr Galloway is currently working on a book on Descartes, and on topics connected to a priori justification.
In recent years Dr Galloway has worked to develop a broad initiative involving the Department of Philosophy and the School of Medicine. The first product of this was the innovative Intercalated BSc in Philosophy and Basic Medical Sciences, which he devised and has now taught for several years. This is a one year intensive course of study in philosophy taken exclusively by medical students, usually after their second or third year of study. Many graduates of the programme have now gone on to postgraduate work at the interface of philosophy and medicine. Another product is a new MA in the Philosophy of Medicine which is now accepting its first intake of students.
Further components of the overall project have been incorporated within the Medical Humanities initiative at King’s. These include the appointment of a research fellowship in the Philosophy of Medicine and a seminar series with a distinguished roster of visiting speakers. A series of conferences devoted to topics at the interface of philosophy and medicine are planned, including the recent workshop in ‘Personhood and Identity in Medicine’ (18 March 2011) Dr Galloway is also working on reader for use in postgraduate and advanced undergraduate courses, and a textbook, provisionally entitled ‘Topics in the Philosophy of Medicine’, based on the contents of the core components of our MA programme.
Dr Galloway welcomes enquiries from prospective students seeking supervision on topics connected with his research interests.
For more details, please see his full research profile.

                           As unquestioned master of the "grotesque", early 19th century writer Edgar Allan Poe is fully represented in this classic
                              collection originally published under the title Selected Writings. David Galloway's introduction reveals Poe not only as a
                              complex personality and one of America's most exotic writers, but also as an individual who engaged in an astonishing variety

                           In David Galloway's novel, A Family Album, the narrator envisions the circumstances behind the production of a series of family
                              photographs. Galloway devotes individual chapters to the cameras, the photographers, and the individual photographs. His meticulous
                              description of the imaginary contexts of production and use of these snapshot photographs sheds light on photography as an
                              aspect of everyday life. --Jeffrey Ruoff, www.darmoht.edu

                                 die den Inhalt und die Musik der Opern ins Bild übertragen. Durch Farbnuancen, Gestus und rhythmischen Aufbau entstehen Hommagen
                                 an Werke wie &#x84;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&#x93; oder &#x84;Orlando&#x93;. 0Die Monografie, herausgegeben von Prof. em. David
