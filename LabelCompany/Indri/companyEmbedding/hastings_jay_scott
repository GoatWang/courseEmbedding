Elevated Garden Beds
Elevated gardens can truly facilitate an individual’s lifelong passion for gardening all while respecting the physical limitations of the gardener them self. A standing garden or elevated raised garden can significantly increase vegetable or plant yield. By lifting the garden off the ground, the elevated planter acts as a plant protector while also allowing the garden to warm up more quickly extending your gardening season. While DIY raised beds are a popular home project and building your own raised bed is quite rewarding, our high quality selection has the grit and reliability to immediately innovate and improve your vegetable gardening experience today. It includes the reputable and popular VegTrug, the perfect elevated trough for your plant, vegetable or flower gardening needs. 


Our selection elevated garden beds and planters eliminate the need to bend or kneel and make it convenient to plant, tend and harvest plants. Enjoy pain-free gardening by growing vegetables and flowers in these fine and high quality planters.
