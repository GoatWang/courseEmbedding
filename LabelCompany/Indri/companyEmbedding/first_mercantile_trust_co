The CIT Difference
With over 25 years experience with collective investment trusts (CITs), First Mercantile Trust optimizes this unique investment vehicle to include a full array of institutional money managers, mutual funds and exchange traded funds, with no proprietary requirements.
The Premiere CIT Provider
CITs can only be offered by banks and trust companies, and their structure and regulatory status is simpler than that of retail mutual funds, resulting in generally lower operational costs.   First Mercantile started offering Collective Investment Trusts in the 1980s and back then, our ability to distribute a CIT product was ahead of its time.  This innovative investment allows smaller plans access to institutional money managers that they might not otherwise be able to obtain.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (9.75% upside)
