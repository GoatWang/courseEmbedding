Everyone was exceptionally courteous and polite. I never felt ignored or that they weren't willing to help as others eluded. In addition, we were kept well-informed of the time frame necessary for our special order to arrive. It arrived as promised and we are very happy with the results. We will definitely go there again in the future.Helpful(0)ShareFlagdoclew05/22/2012OverallMy wife and I are repeat custo...My wife and I are repeat customers. It saddens me to see negative reviews because the people at Bradley Michael's have provided the best salesperson experience we've ever known. They don't pressure or hassle you. And it is common sense that special order pieces take time to be special ordered - everyone knows that. We've been remodeling the house and have returned to Bradley Michael each time to add a modern look to our home. Brad was wonderful and worked with my wife to choose furniture suitable to our tastes. This time I got my rustic man cave. Couldn't be happier!Helpful(0)ShareFlagbestcritic32705/21/2012OverallAWESOME EXPERIENCE! The owner ...AWESOME EXPERIENCE! The owner took his time showing my husband and I around the showroom and even made a house call to help us plan our new living room. I cannot describe how in love I am with our new room. They went beyond our expectations choosing the perfect accessories. Wonderful people! Wonderful results!Helpful(0)ShareFlagReviewer068504/10/2012Provided by Citysearch - OverallHorrible Experience - Good Furniture, Bad BusinessReceiving good service from Bradley Michaels Furniture is an unpredictable thing.  In mid January of 2012 my wife and I ordered a king-size wooden bed made by Mobel Inc.  Mobel has a limited number of distributors for their products, and Bradley Michaels was the closest in proximity to where we live.  Initially, the bed had shipped and arrived at our home within five weeks of requesting it.  Considering that the bed first needed to be manufactured by Mobel, then be sent to Bradley Michaels, and finally delivered to us, waiting only one month and a week was not bad at all.  Additionally, the delivery service was free.  However, during the process of installation, Bradley Michael's delivery men severely damaged the headboard piece with a rubber mallet.  They were having difficulties passing the piece through the door frame and figured that by hammering off one of the legs and the molding at the top they  would be able to get it into the bedroom.  What could be more ridiculous than professional furniture movers beating the crap out the furniture in order to assemble it?  I went into the store the following day and personally informed Michael of what happened.  As I offered him various pictures that I had printed out of the damage,  he said he only wanted one.  However, he called me two days later asking me to write an e-mail to his service department with the pictures I had taken.  Not that it is a big deal, but I did not expect to do the leg work to fix a problem that his associated created (especially when I had already offered him the same pictures in person).  From here on out, the experience only gets much worse.  Michael had told me that I would have to wait about three weeks for a replacement headboard to come in.  When three weeks had passed, I called Michael to check on the status and he told me that the the headboard was already made, but that the truck at Mobel would not be able to ship it until the overall load met the minimum weight requirement, and that I'd have to wait another ten days.  Now let it be said that, when a furniture company sends a delivery service that damages its merchandise (actually the customers merchandise, since $1,600 was withdrawn from my account the day I ordered the bed) and then does not deliver the replacement part by the time the owner had indicated, the customer should not have to wait any longer; the company should be responsible for a fast and efficient shipping method, even if it be Fed Ex.  [Review Continued Under Comment Section]Helpful(0)FlagPB201201/09/2012Provided by Citysearch - OverallWorst Furniture Experience - DO NOT BUYIf I could give a negative star rating on our experience thus far I would do so.  I will never by furniture from these guys again at this point.  We spent a significant sum on furniture for our family room and dining room this past summer.  The furniture took several months to be delivered and there have been problems since the first piece arrived.	 Run from these guys.  They lure you in with a great showroom, friendly staff and an accommodating/consultative approach.  But buyer beware...quality of the furniture is horrible and service after the sale non-existent.	 Example 1: Chairs for dining room table are not properly stained, have stripped bolts underneath and lose legs.  The absolutely worst craftsmanship I've ever seen.  It has been several months since we logged our first complaint and customer service call.  No one has fixed anything to date despite numeours promises.	 Example 2: Our leather chair and ottoman have cheap finishes that come off every time something is placed on them and removed.  It looks horrible after about 4 months of use.  I have a leather couch in another room that we've owned for over 8 years with less loss of finish and a completely different level of construction quality (Hancock and Moore) that costs the same.  Again...placed multiple service calls and nothing has been done to date.	 Beyond frustrated with our furniture from Bradley Michaels.Helpful(0)Flagpizzaking41211/02/2009Provided by Citysearch - Overallstill waiting.....Ordered in March, 8k worth. Received everything in a reasonable time. Made 5 payments so far. Ripped sectional upon delivery. Called within the hour to complain. Talked to Mike and said he would send someone out. Some representative from BM comes in July and never comes back to fix it. Im still waiting (nov.2). On my way over tmrw, to be continued....Helpful(0)FlagSGoz10/06/2009Provided by Citysearch - OverallALWAYS Great Service & Beautiful FurnitureI have decorated two homes with Bradley Michaels furniture.  Their personalized service and attention to detail is what makes this store different from others.  They offer decorating services which I have used quite often.  The brands they offer are of the highest quality and for great prices.  	I recently wanted to puchase new bedroom furniture for my son.  One of the owners came to my house to see the room and brought along catalogs for my review.  I placed an order and a couple weeks later the furniture was delivered!  	No problems EVER with this store..nothing but excellent service and excellent furniture!!Helpful(0)FlagMarkoZ08/18/2009Provided by Citysearch - OverallMarko asked to leave store by ownerMarch 26, 09 	Ordered sectional furniture	 August 18, 09	Manufacturer delays; slow communication; voicemail stating $300 credit from manufacturer; reduction of credit by owner; overall...unhappy with the experience with the company.Helpful(0)Flagihtak403/17/2009Provided by Citysearch - OverallSo far a truly wonderful experience..We love BradleyMichaels and Brad and Michael and their staff are attentive and quite friendly.  FUN!  The showroom is immaculate and all done quite tastefully.  The furniture is beautiful and quite reasonably priced.  The creative and great ideas and help given to us by both Michael and Brad have been wonderful. 	     We purchased our furniture over a year ago, Brad and Michael are graciously  holding it for us until we are ready to move south.  We can't thank them enough for that.  Brad held a lamp for us for over a year, that surprised us. We didn't think it'd still be there.  We are so grateful to him.   Michael is arranging to have our furniture delivered to SC in July.  The price given to us is very reasonable.  I enjoy browsing in BradleyMichaels, its a wonderful experience.  Both Brad and Michael are very talented and have VERY good ideas and incredible taste.  Beside they are just simply alot of fun and down to earth!  If you haven't been there, treat yourself....don't listen to reviews, GO!	      After our furniture is delivered in July and everything is perfect, which I just know it will be,  I will continue to praise BradleyMichaels Furniture Store and its owners, Brad and Michael.   AWESOME!   After delivery I'm sure I will go with 5 stars.........  :)	 KathiHelpful(0)FlagMap & DirectionsPeople Also ViewedGoodwill Stores2780 Saw Mill Run Blvd, Pittsburgh, PAMy House To Your's(1)28 Old Clairton Rd, Pittsburgh, PAGoodwill Stores4647 Buttermilk Hollow Rd, West Mifflin, PAFinders Keepers431 Cochran Rd, Pittsburgh, PACharlie's Used Furniture(2)143 Brownsville Rd, Pittsburgh, PAPaid AdvertisementRelated ArticlesWhich Home Security System Is Right for Me?Home security comprises a number of different technologies, tools and techniques.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
