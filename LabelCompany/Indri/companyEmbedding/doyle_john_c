John C. Doyle
J.R. Smallwood was always on the lookout for entrepreneurs and advisors who could help bring about his dream of economic diversification and prosperity. Perhaps the most colourful was John C. Doyle.  Born in Chicago in 1915, Doyle went to western Canada as a coal salesman, moving east in 1949. He purchased Canadian Javelin Foundries and Machine Works, a Joliette, Québec, stove-making operation.  The business was reorganized in 1951 as Canadian Javelin Limited, which Doyle used as a holding company for his subsequent ventures. 
Industrial Development Opportunity:  Iron Ore Around Wabush Lake
Doyle first became interested in Newfoundland’s resources in 1952. On his way to the province to collect a large coal debt, he met the provincial geologist. The latter told Doyle that a strip of iron-ore rich land around Wabush Lake in Labrador was about to revert to the government – or more accurately, to the Newfoundland and Labrador Corporation (NALCO), a development company created by the provincial government (and Alfred Valdmanis) in 1951.  The area originally belonged to the Labrador Mining and Exploration Company, which shed it under an agreement that stipulated that 10 percent of the company’s concessions had to be relinquished every year. 
In July 1953, NALCO granted concessions to Doyle and Javelin, which included the rights to a large area of western Labrador containing iron-ore rich deposits.  From this point on the story is confused, but it appears that in September 1953, Doyle and Javelin acquired a controlling interest in NALCO, with six seats on the board.  Valdmanis did his best to block Javelin taking over NALCO completely, but failed – even though Doyle was in financial difficulties and Javelin shares had been de-listed from the Montreal stock exchange.  In the end, Smallwood sided with Doyle against Valdmanis, and in March 1954 the former received 2,400 square miles of prime NALCO holdings in central Labrador.  NALCO was reorganized in such a way that most directors were to be provincial government nominees.
Doyle spent approximately $15 million surveying and drilling the area around Lake Wabush. He also commissioned American engineering expertise to improve the ore benefaction process, and brought about the consortium of international mining interests known as Wabush Mines. Before the opening of the mines The Sunday Times Supplement optimistically gushed, “After Javelin, neither Newfoundland nor the international steel industry will be quite the same again” (Ore: 25). In the mid 1950s Doyle also built a railway connecting Wabush to the Québec North Shore and the Labrador Railway, but not without the Newfoundland government guaranteeing a $16.5 million bond issue enabling him to do so.  The bond was never called in, but it was an issue that raised some strenuous objections in the House of Assembly.
Smallwood was clearly impressed by Doyle’s ability to promote industrial development, and overlooked his shady financial manoeuvres – indeed, the government continued to put money into Javelin projects, and Memorial University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1962 – linked, no doubt, to his donation of $500,000 for a student residence.
Newfoundland and Labrador's Greatest White Collar Criminal
Doyle faced income tax investigations in the early 1950s, and Canadian Javelin continued to be de-listed from the stock exchanges for securities violations throughout the mid 1950s and into the 60s.  In 1959 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) became involved because Canadian Javelin stocks were trading vigorously in the United States.  The stocks were not registered in the United States and in order to do so the vendor (Doyle) needed to provide detailed financial information about the company. Doyle was never forthcoming with financial information about his companies.  In 1960 he was arraigned in Montréal on charges of theft, conspiracy and fraud involving $4,800,000 in mining stock, though the charges ware ultimately dismissed. 
By 1963 the SEC caught up with him again and the lead investigator laid eleven charges against Doyle involving fraud and stock manipulation, as well as a technical violation resulting from sending unregistered stock through the mail to an investor.  He was fined $5,000 for this offence and sentenced to serve a reduced term of three months.  Doyle jumped bail and skipped the country on July 15, 1965. He later claimed that he plead guilty in an effort to get the ordeal over with, a move he would never have made if he had suspected jail time was imminent. By the end of the 1960s, Canadian tax collectors also began to hound Doyle for claims going back two decades.  He managed to have the amounts reduced through appeals from $3.4 million in back taxes to $2.6 million. 
Doyle had a sketchy financial past long before he came to Newfoundland, but his disastrous foray into the paper business is what he is mainly remembered for. Smallwood always had aspirations for a third pulp and paper mill in the province and some of the literature claims Doyle did too.  However, in an interview in The Evening Telegram in 1972 Doyle claimed he never wanted anything to do with the paper business.  “We only got into it [the linerboard project] because Smallwood insisted he couldn’t find anyone else…We wanted to develop our ore body.  We made no bones about the fact that we weren’t paper people.” (The Evening Telegram, April 28, 1972)  Eventually, Smallwood and Doyle did agree on a joint venture for a linerboard mill in Stephenville utilizing wood from Labrador. In 1969 a subsidiary of Javelin, the Melville Pulp and Paper Company, began cutting pulpwood in Goose Bay for the Stephenville mill.
The linerboard mill proved to be a disastrous project. The estimated cost of the entire project including the wood-cutting facilities in Labrador, the transportation costs involved, and the linerboard mill was approximately $143.6 million.  The federal government committed $20.1 million toward harbour improvements, waterworks, and incentive grants for the project.  Other capital was guaranteed through some British banks, the British government, and an American financial house. Doyle’s initial investment was only $5.3 million, borrowed from a pension fund controlled by Jimmy Hoffa’s Teamsters Union. He eventually came up with $11.5 million working capital of his own, but only after the Canadian government expressed concern about Doyle’s meagre financial commitment. 
The provincial government initially committed $53 million to the project, but made a fatal error in judgement by including an “open-ended” clause in the 1967 Melville Pulp and Paper Ltd. Authorization of Agreement Act, or Bill 44. This allowed the government to exceed initial funding projections and provide whatever monies were necessary for the completion of the project. In 1969 the government guaranteed an additional $13,260,000.  As associated costs continued to rise the provincial government continued to rescue the project.  In November 1970 when a consulting firm warned of the suspension of construction due to lack of finances, the Newfoundland government infused $9 million on June 25, 1971 and another $6 million four months later. By 1972 the linerboard venture had cost the Newfoundland government approximately $122 million and the mill had not yet opened its doors. Frank Moores’ Progressive Conservative government moved in, purchased the mill from Doyle, and turned the business into a Crown Corporation.
The scandal caused by John Doyle and the Stephenville linerboard mill may have been the biggest white-collar crime in Newfoundland and Labrador’s history.  Doyle manipulated Javelin stocks so that the bulk of the profit would go to the Melville Pulp and Paper Company and Canadian Javelin, but not to the Newfoundland government, the majority Javelin shareholder.  The “privileged” stocks he created for the government paid no dividends and were redeemable at 10 cents each totalling $530,000 – independent of how much Javelin common stock became worth. This ultimately gave Doyle power over the company stockholders seeking to get rid of him, while providing no financial benefit for the government.
It was reported that Doyle paid his lawyers $4 million yearly to keep him out of trouble. Nevertheless, he was charged in the Newfoundland Supreme Court in 1973 by the RCMP with 400 counts of fraud and breach of trust stemming from the linerboard scheme, and he was brought forcibly to St. John's.  The mill had been built on the former site of the United States Air Force base, which included two buildings valued by the provincial government at $8.2 million.  It was alleged that Doyle purchased them for a mere $250,000 through Oliver Vardy, the Deputy Minister of Economic Development, who was rumoured to be heavily involved in Doyle’s schemes.
Doyle was also investigated for a suspicious land purchase.  Product for the linerboard mill was to be harvested within two blocks of land totalling 21,325 square miles in Labrador.  Around 11,000 square miles belonged to NALCO (then a Canadian Javelin subsidiary) and the other 10,325 square miles had been purchased by Doyle for $4 million from a “…curious company called Société Transshipping owned in Liechtenstein…” (MacLeans: 36). Doyle had been previously accused of funnelling $4.8 million dollars worth of Canadian Javelin stock to Liechtenstein.  It was thrown out of court, but suspicions were aroused and the RCMP became interested in the authenticity of Doyle’s purchase of timber rights.  According to the province’s then Conservative Finance Minister, John Crosbie, Société Transshipping had received the timber rights free of charge, based on a March 1965 letter from then Liberal Premier, Joseph Smallwood. The whole deal was more than a little dubious.  By the mid-1960s Doyle’s name was also linked to the “L’affaire des Six” bribery scandal in Québec. No evidence was ever found.  Meanwhile, Smallwood was enamoured with Doyle even after his 1973 arrest. Time magazine quipped, “Joey Smallwood once boasted that he wished the province had 1,000 John C. Doyles. If so, Newfoundland would have been hard put for courtrooms to accommodate them” (Time: 7). 
A Master Manipulator
How was Doyle able to get away with so much for so long? Smallwood’s obsession with job creation was one of the biggest reasons, which essentially made Newfoundland an easy target to exploit.  Crosbie nicknamed Doyle an “evil genius,” a “seductive slug,” and characterized the relationship between the American and Premier Smallwood as “one of the most tawdry stories in twentieth-century politics” (Globe and Mail: 16). But besides Smallwood's complicity, Doyle himself was a master manipulator. When two FBI agents came to question him concerning violations of American securities laws, Doyle turned on his “easy charm” and sold them stock in Canadian Javelin. Doyle left a legacy of convoluted government loans and international transactions tainting the Newfoundland government and the Stephenville Linerboard Mill that have never been entirely unravelled.  His history with the law is one of skilful escapes and evasions. Doyle became active in South America through Canadian Javelin and made news headlines well into the eighties. The Federal Corporations Branch of the Ministry of Corporate and Consumer Affairs filed a claim to nullify his 14.9% holding in Javelin in 1982, but he continued to draw a salary from Javelin up to 1985.  Doyle died in his Panama home (a fugitive from justice) at the age of eighty-five on May 31, 2000.

ART BIO







The John C. Doyle Art Gallery has been in business for over 30 years, as Mr. Doyle began painting with many other local Charleston painters in the 1970’s when there were no galleries in Charleston, and eventually began selling out of his home and studio on King Street in the 1980’s. Mr. Doyle passed away in November of 2014 after completing well over 1500 paintings in his prolific career. It was his specific wish the gallery continue in his namesake, and gallery director Angela Stump is honored to abide this wish. We offer many original oils, sketches, and photography by Mr. Doyle, as well as over 150 high quality reproductions on canvas in all of the various subjects he painted – from blue hydrangeas to blues musicians. We also represent fellow native artist Margaret Petterson, and offer her vibrant original oils and unique mixed media monotypes.

                              in state space models can be rearranged into the mu framework. The theories for computation of the upper and lower bounds
                              on mu are developed. The relationships between the upper bound and mu for various block structures are explored. The extensions
                              of the mu-based methods to time-varying and nonlinear controllers are outlined. Keywords: Linear fractional transformation;

                              There exists a widely recognized need to better understand and manage complex "systems of systems," ranging from biology,
                                 ecology, and medicine to network-centric technologies. This is motivating the search for universal laws of highly evolved
                                 systems and driving demand for new mathematics and methods that are consistent, integrative, and predictive. However, the
                                 theoretical frameworks available today are not merely fragmented but sometimes contradictory and incompatible. We argue that
                                 complexity arises in highly evolved biological and technological systems primarily to provide mechanisms to create robustness.
                                 However, this complexity itself can be a source of new fragility leading to "robust yet fragile" tradeoffs in system design.
                                 We focus on the role of robustness and architecture in networked infrastructures, and we highlight recent advances in the
                                 theory of distributed control driven by network technologies. This view of complexity in highly organized technological and
                                 biological systems is fundamentally different from the dominant perspective in the mainstream sciences, which downplays function,
                                 constraints and tradeoffs, and tends to minimize the role of organization and design

                              The problem of stabilization of linear systems with bounded structured uncertainties are considered in this paper. Two notions
                                 of stability, denoted quadratic stability (Q-stability) and stability, are considered, and corresponding notions of stabilizability
                                 and detectability are defined. In both cases, the output feedback stabilization problem is reduced via a separation argument
                                 to two simpler problems: full information (I) and full control (FC). The set of all stabilizing controllers can be parametrized
                                 as a linear fractional transformation (LFT) on a free stable parameter. For Q-stability, stabilizability and detectability
                                 can in turn be characterized by Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), and the FI and FC Q-stabilization problems can be solved
                                 using the corresponding LMIs. In the standard one-dimensional case the results in this paper reduce to well-known results
                                 on controller parametrization using state-space methods, although the development here relies more heavily on elegant LFT
                                 machinery and avoids the need for coprime factorizations

                              Several new results were obtained extending standard analysis techniques to Linear Fractional Transformations (LFT) using
                                 Structured Singular Value, Micron, and Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) in solving LFT problems. LFTs and LMIs play a very
                                 important role in postmodern control theory by providing a framework that unifies many concepts and generalizes transfer functions
                                 and their state-space realizations to include uncertainty. Doyle, Zhou, and Packard (1991) reviews known results on robust
                                 stability and performance and establishes a common and unified framework for the companion papers, which consider generalizations
                                 and extensions of balanced realizations and model reduction (Wang, Doyle, Beck, and Glover, 1991), stabilization (Lu, Zhou,

                              For many mathematicians and physicists, the Internet has become a popular real-world domain for the application and/or development
                                 of new theories related to the organization and behavior of large-scale, complex, and dynamic systems. In some cases, the
                                 Internet has served both as inspiration and justification for the popularization of new models and mathematics within the
                                 scientific enterprise. For example, scale-free network models of the preferential attachment type [8] have been claimed to
                                 describe the Internet's connectivity structure, resulting in surprisingly general and strong claims about the network's resilience
                                 to random failures of its components and its vulnerability to targeted attacks against its infrastructure [2]. These models
                                 have, as their trademark, power-law type node degree distributions that drastically distinguish them from the classical Erdos-Renyi
                                 type random graph models [13]. These "scale-free" network models have attracted significant attention within the scientific
                                 community and have been partly responsible for launching and fueling the new field of network science [42, 4]

                              Considerable attention is now being devoted to the study of "complexity science" with the intent of discovering and applying
                                 universal laws of highly interconnected and evolved systems. This paper considers several issues related to the use of these
                                 theories in the context of critical infrastructures, particularly the Internet. Specifically, we revisit the notion of "organized
                                 complexity" and suggest that it is fundamental to our ability to understand, operate, and design next-generation infrastructure
                                 networks. We comment on the role of engineering in defining an architecture to support networked infrastructures and highlight
                                 recent advances in the theory of distributed control driven by network technologies

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Doyle, John C carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Doyle, John C currently holds license DOYLEJC209OP (Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Doyle, John C



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Doyle, John C



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.









About BuildZoom






BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.

BuildZoom combines license information on 3.5 million contractors with
110 million building permits, and over 80,000
reviews from property owners.If you are looking for a specific
contractor and you can’t find them on BuildZoom, it’s likely that they do
not have a license - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Contractor through BuildZoom



The best way to use BuildZoom is to let us recommend contractors for
your remodeling projects.


Homeowners who

hire through BuildZoom's free bidding system

Press Coverage





BuildZoom’s database now contains every licensed contractor across the U.S. - over 2.5 million of them... Categorized contractor profiles are enriched using government data from state licensing boards, Better Business Bureau ratings, and more…


BuildZoom jumped into the fray by announcing that it raised $10.6 million in a round led by Formation 8. ...the Y combinator-backed startup said it will be focused on remodeling projects, where the median budget is around $19,000…


A new index compiled by BuildZoom — which identifies contractors for projects — found that renovations are
running 2.8 percent above their 2005 level…

 New Course Spring 2017 CDS 270-1 Complex networks, architecture, and evolution
Org meeting and first class: 2:30 Tu Apr 4 213 ANN
For more details:  See Course details for more
Aims: Complex tech, bio, neuro, med, eco, and socio-econ networks have both strikingly universal shared architectural features and constraining "laws" but with extremely different domain specific details.  This course will use familiar case studies to motivate a new mathematical framework for understanding these similarities and differences, emphasizing layering, dynamics, optimization, nonlinearity, learning, communications, and control, sparsity and structure, and tradeoffs between robustness, efficiency, and evolvability.  The aim will be to establish a common core of concepts accessible to anyone at Caltech, with optional additional domain and math details more aimed at experts.  Lectures will primarily be by video with class time devoted to discussions.  Lots of live demos and games involving audience participation.
Grading: P/F only
Units: from 3 to 9 units by arrangement and in accordance with effort (e.g. from 3 units for videos and discussions to 9 units adding reading and project)  Ideally, projects would involve teams of domain experts with CDS and CMS theorists. Projects can lead to papers or add to video materials.
Motivating case studies and projects will be drawn from a variety of areas.  Students with domain expertise can help form teams to explore using new theory in these areas. There will be videos and reading on these topics, but students are urged to suggest others.
Neuroscience: sensorimotor control, spiking neurons, and limits to performance; planning and reflex; modularity, plasticity, learning, and evolution; vision and the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR); balance and bipedalism; automation and (un)conscious; fMRI and EEG analysis; throwing and hitting a 100 mph fastball;
Internet: Software defined networking (SDN), Internet of things (IOT), Application driven networking (ADN), content centric, operating systems, Network function virtualization (NFV), routing, congestion control, end-to-end and local, protocol stacks, aggregation
Microbial cell: metabolism; glycolytic oscillations; stress response; signal transduction; gene regulation; evolution, horizontal gene transfer; immune mechanisms; pathogenesis; microbiomes; phage physiology; 
Power: Future smartgrid; optimization, control; cascading outages; challenge of renewables; role of storage and controllable loads
Ecosystems: wildfire ecology; Mediterranean climates; fire in the earth system 
Medicine and physiology: cardiovascular physiology, heart rate variability, (an)aerobic metabolism, fatigue, training; sepsis and shock; electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction; development, wound healing, and cancer
Physics: multiscale and complexity; high shear flows, turbulence, coherent structures, blunting, and drag; statistical mechanics, fluctuation-dissipation, back action and measurement, uncertainty principles, quantum measurement; phase transitions, criticality, optimization; 
Social sciences: behavorial economics, casinos, the hot hand fallacy (fallacy), (non)stationary stochastic process, and evolutionary psychology; risk and uncertainty; chimps, bonobos, baboons, and gorillas; orcas and elephants; ants and bees; violence; patriarchy and matriarchy; fear, anger, hatred; empathy, compassion;  language; bipedalism and weapons; agriculture and owners, soldiers, and slaves; Egypt, Sparta, Athens, Rome, China; Adam Smith; American Civil War ; technology, industrialization, and automation; World wars and depressions; wealth inequality; the 60s (1860s and 1960s) and "rights"; financialization; tech and social networks; current politics and media; Putin, Trump, and Brexit; 
Article on animal social justice
Transitions in evolution, architecture, and complexity: e.g. life, metabolism, ribosomes, oxygen, mitochondria, brains, flight, warm blood, maternal care, bipedalism, weapons, language, agriculture, states, money, industry, technology, IOT, ...
Universal laws and architectures: across all domains there are hard limits or "laws" on robustness vs efficiency, speed vs accuracy, with efficiency and robustness conservation laws that limit what is possible; universal architectures allow components to achieve what laws allow, and mix diverse components to create systems that achieve what no component can alone; universals including layering, hourglasses and bowties with thin waists and knots; planning and reflex layers; apps, OS, and hardware; horizontal swapping of apps, genes, memes; these are all largely unknown in science and poorly taught in engineering, with little or no theory, until recently; LEGOS as a model system; Darwin, Turing, Bode, Wiener, Shannon, Von Neumann, the death of cybernetics;
Infectious hijacking: layered architectures are vulnerable to infectious hijacking; mechanisms that swap apps, genes, and memes facilitate hijacking by viral, pathogenic versions; toxoplasmosis and zombie parasites; phage kill half the ocean's bacteria daily; network and automation technologies with increasingly dangerous, pervasive cybersecurity vulnerabilities; human's ultimate weakness may be strongly held beliefs (memes) that are contagious, false, dangerous, and unhealthy; parasites vs predators;
New “sciences”: complexity science; network science; edge of chaos; power laws; self-organized criticality; scale-free networks; small worlds; zombie science; hoaxiness; emergulence
Theory foundations:  We will aim for a more integrated and accessible treatment of control theory, dynamical systems, optimization, probability and statistics, machine learning, communications theory, and computational complexity. Focus on "deep" fragilities. Previous familiarity or study is helpful but not essential as the questions arising in the case studies can be largely appreciated with minimal math, though the answers go through layers of increasing theory complexity.  Students who do have backgrounds in these areas will be particularly useful in teams with domain experts.

 Brief Bio
John Doyle is the Jean-Lou Chameau Professor of Control and Dynamical Systems, Electrical Engineer, and BioEngineering at Caltech, and received the BS&MS in EE, MIT (1977), and PhD in Math, UC Berkeley (1984)). He was a consultant at Honeywell Systems and Research Center from 1976 to 1990.
Research is on mathematical foundations for complex networks with applications in biology, technology, medicine, ecology, neuroscience, and multiscale physics that integrates theory from control, computation, communication, optimization, statistics (e.g. Machine Learning). An emphasis on universal laws and architectures, robustness/efficiency and speed/accuracy tradeoffs, adaptability, and evolvability and large scale systems with sparse, saturating, delayed, quantized, uncertain sensing, communications, computing, and actuation. Early work was on robustness of feedback control systems with applications to aerospace and process control. His students and research group developed software packages like the Matlab Robust Control Toolbox and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). 
Prizes, awards, records, championships include the 1990 IEEE Baker Prize (for all IEEE publications), also listed in the world top 10 “most important" papers in mathematics 1981-1993, IEEE Automatic Control Transactions Award (twice 1998, 1999), 1994 AACC American Control Conference Schuck Award, 2004 ACM Sigcomm Paper Prize and 2017 “test of time” award, and inclusion in Best Writing on Mathematics 2010. Individual awards include 1977 IEEE Power Hickernell, 1983 AACC Eckman, 1984 UC Berkeley Friedman, 1984 IEEE Centennial Outstanding Young Engineer (a one-time award for IEEE 100th anniversary), and 2004 IEEE Control Systems Field Award. Best known for fabulous friends, partner, colleagues, and students, with 16 of his advisees (mostly PhDs, some postdocs) now professors at “THE world top” universities (Berkeley(x3), MIT(x2), ETHZ (x2), Imperial (x2), Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, Hopkins, UCLA, Caltech). Has held world and national records and championships in various sports, but is otherwise quite fragile.
