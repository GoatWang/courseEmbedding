This Amendment No. 3 (this “Amendment”) to the Statement on Schedule 13D is filed by the Reporting Persons as an amendment to the Schedule 13D filed on June 10, 2014 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D filed on August 13, 2014 with the SEC and Amendment No. 2 to the Schedule 13D Filed on November 19, 2015 (collectively, the “Schedule 13D”) with respect to the Class B Common Stock. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Schedule 13D.
The “Explanatory Note” is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
“EXPLANATORY NOTE: Each of Extended Stay America, Inc., the Blackstone Entities (collectively, “Blackstone”), Centerbridge Entities (collectively, “Centerbridge”), and Paulson Entities (collectively, “Paulson”), listed in Item 4 below (Blackstone, Centerbridge and Paulson, collectively, the “Sponsors”), is a party to a Stockholders’ Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2013 (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”) that is described in Item 4 below. Given the terms of the Stockholders’ Agreement, as of the date hereof, Extended Stay America, Inc. and each of the Sponsors and certain of their respective affiliates may be deemed to be a member of a group that owns 113,010,388 Paired Shares, or 57% of the outstanding Paired Shares, 250,493,583 Class A Shares, or 100% of the outstanding Class A Shares, which are convertible into 250,493,583  Class B Shares, or 55.8% of all Class B Shares (in each case, calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d) of the Act) and 21,202 shares of voting preferred stock of Extended Stay America, Inc., or 100% of the outstanding voting preferred stock of Extended Stay America, Inc.”
Item 2.  Identity and Background.
The entities directly holding the Paired Shares as described in this Item 2 below underwent an internal restructuring whereby such entities now have different general partners (or such entities’ general partners have different general partners) than reflected in prior filings.  As reflected in this Item 2 below, Centerbridge Credit Cayman GP Ltd. replaced Centerbridge Credit GP Investors, L.L.C. and Centerbridge Credit Offshore GP Investors, L.L.C. as the general partner of Centerbridge Credit Partners General Partner, L.P.  and Centerbridge Credit Partners Offshore General Partner, L.P., respectively, Centerbridge Cayman GP Ltd. replaced Centerbridge GP Investors, LLC as general partner of Centerbridge Associates, L.P., and CCP SBS GP, LLC replaced Centerbridge Associates, L.P. as the general partner of Centerbridge Capital Partners SBS, L.P. 
As a result, Item 2 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
