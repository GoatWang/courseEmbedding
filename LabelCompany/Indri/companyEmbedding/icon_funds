ICON Fund seeks capital appreciation, with a secondary objective of capital preservation to provide long-term growth.   The Fund uses a quantitative methodology to identify securities ICON believes are underpriced relative to value. It normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities traded in the U.S. This strategy may not be changed unless Fund shareholders are given at least 60 days’ prior notice. Equity securities in which the Fund may invest include common stocks and preferred stocks of companies of any market capitalization.   
There are risks involved with mutual fund investing, including the risk of loss of principal. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results. An investment concentrated in sectors and industries may involve greater risk and volatility than a more diversified investment. There are risks associated with Small and Mid Cap investing such as less liquidity, limited product lines, and small market share.

























   Investing in securities involves inherent risks, including the risk that you can lose the value of your investment. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results.  Consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and share classes of each ICON Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus, summary prospectus and the statement of additional information contain this and other information about the Funds; please read the prospectus, summary prospectus and the statement of additional information carefully before investing.

ICON’s value-based investing model is an analytical, quantitative approach to investing that employs various factors, including projected earnings growth estimates and bond yields, in an effort to determine whether securities are over- or underpriced relative to ICON’s estimates of their intrinsic value. ICON’s value approach involves forward-looking statements and assumptions based on judgments and projections that are neither predictive nor guarantees of future results. Value readings are contingent on several variables including, without limitation, earnings, growth estimates, interest rates and overall market conditions. Although valuation readings serve as guidelines for our investment decisions, we retain the discretion to buy and sell securities that fall beyond these guidelines as needed. Value investing involves risks and uncertainties and does not guarantee better performance or lower costs than other investment methodologies.     There are risks involved with mutual fund investing, including the risk of loss of principal.

This information does not constitute tax advice. For tax-related questions, please consult your accountant or tax professional.    The data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the data quoted. Please call 1-800-828-4881 or » click here for performance results current to the most recent month-end. Returns assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions and reflect applicable fees and expenses.    There are risks involved with mutual fund investing, including the risk of loss of principal. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results.   Investments in international securities may entail unique risks, including political, market, regulatory and currency risks. Financial statements of foreign companies are governed by different accounting, auditing, and financial standards than U.S. companies and may be less transparent and uniform than in the United States. Many corporate governance standards, which help ensure the integrity of public information in the United States, do not exist in foreign countries. In general, there is less governmental supervision of foreign stock exchanges and securities brokers and issuers. An investment in a region fund may involve greater risk and volatility than a more diversified fund.   Investing in fixed income securities such as bonds involves interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities generally decreases. The Bond Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in high-yield bonds that are below investment grade. High-yield bonds involve a greater risk of default and price volatility than U.S. Government and other higher-quality bonds.    Call options involve certain risks, such as limited gains and lack of liquidity of the underlying securities, and are not suitable for all investors.  There are risks associated with selling short, including the risk that the Long/Short Fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short price, resulting in a loss. The Fund's loss on a short sale is potentially unlimited as a loss occurs when the value of a security sold short increases.   An investment concentrated in sectors and industries may involve greater risk and volatility than a more diversified investment, and the Technology sector has been among the most volatile sectors in the market. There are risks associated with Small and Mid Cap investing such as less liquidity, limited product lines, and small market share.  

   Investing in securities involves inherent risks, including the risk that you can lose the value of your investment. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results.  Consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and share classes of each ICON Fund carefully before investing.

ICON Emerging Markets Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.   
The Fund uses a quantitative methodology to identify industries and sectors in emerging market securities that ICON’s methodology suggests are underpriced or overpriced relative to our calculation of intrinsic value. ICON believes that equity markets go through themes over time. Simply stated, stocks in industries that were market leaders at one time tend to become overpriced relative to intrinsic value, and stocks in industries that were not in favor tend to drop below intrinsic value. We compute a value-to-price ratio for the securities in our database to determine whether industries, sectors and a country’s securities markets are over- or underpriced. As themes in the market change over time, different countries, industries, and sectors may become leaders. We sell industries we believe are overpriced and buy industries we believe are underpriced, as identified by our valuation model, to capture developing industry and sector themes without restrictions on market capitalization. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in a single industry. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of issuers whose principal activities are in an emerging market, or are economically tied to an emerging market country. 
In general, countries may be considered emerging or developing if they are included on any one of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) Emerging Markets Index, classified as a developing or emerging market or classified under a similar or corresponding classification, by organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. For purposes of the Fund’s investments, a determination is made that an issuer’s principal activities are in an emerging market country or that an issuer is economically tied to an emerging market country by utilizing the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) global classification of securities methodology (“MSCI Global Classification”). The MSCI Global Classification, in general, looks at the country of incorporation and where the securities are primarily listed. However, in some situations additional factors may also need to be considered, such as: the geographic distribution of the issuer’s operations (in terms of assets and production); the location of its headquarters; and the country in which investors consider the issuer to be most appropriately classified. Such a determination can also be based, in whole or in part, on classifications under the MSCI Emerging Markets Economic Index. This strategy may not be changed unless Fund shareholders are given at least 60 days’ prior notice. Equity securities in which the Fund may invest include common and preferred stocks of companies of any market capitalization   
There are risks involved with mutual fund investing, including the risk of loss of principal. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results. Investments in international securities may entail unique risks, including political, market, regulatory and currency risks. Financial statements of foreign companies are governed by different accounting, auditing, and financial standards than U.S. companies and may be less transparent and uniform than in the United States. Many corporate governance standards, which help ensure the integrity of public information in the United States, do not exist in foreign countries. In general, there is less governmental supervision of foreign stock exchanges and securities brokers and issuers. An investment in a region fund may involve greater risk and volatility than a more diversified fund. There are risks associated with Small and Mid Cap investing such as less liquidity, limited product lines, and small market share.

The Bahamas investment condominium is an 'ICON' – Product targets LATAM market

The Bahamas maturity as a wealth management centre provides it with an inherent understanding that changes to its regulatory and business environment should not be knee-jerk reactions to market or political conditions but measured responses that build on the trust and confidence that the jurisdiction has earned – and values – among the broad choice of global institutions which provide asset management, private banking, trust, and related services to owners of capital from around the world.
Indicative of the measured and progressive approach is The Bahamas’ carefully designed regulatory environment for investment funds.  Indeed this design has borne fruit; over the last few years, there has been year upon year growth largely on the back of the investment fund vehicle known as the SMART Fund.  Even with more institutionally focused templates like the SMART 7, SMART Fund Models (SFMs) have been used as a cost-effective investment fund vehicle for families, family offices, and related investors.
 
The SMART Fund concept was conceived in the spirit of truly risk based regulation in recognition of the fact that depending on the structure of the investment fund, the regulation could be tailored appropriately to fit the specific business case.   This is justified by the cap on the number of investors that may invest in many of the templates. As a result, the regulation accommodates agreement by a small number of investors to waive the production of audited financials in favour of semi-annual performance reports.  In practice, this waiver may be utilised once or not at all but the utility is there should the investment fund require it to accommodate an illiquid strategy, or the consolidation of an audit in one jurisdiction.  SMART Funds reflect market responsiveness which is the flame that ignites innovation in The Bahamas. Its flashpoint is the level and intensity of public and private interaction that is the basis of legislation creating client-centric products and services within a modern and robust regulatory regime.
 
While the number of SMART Funds on the register grows, The Bahamas is not content to be viewed as simply a niche fund player; it has set its sights much higher, looking to expand awareness of its entire funds offering, including its well-regarded professional fund which may be established for sophisticated investors satisfying certain net worth qualifying criteria.  
 
Years of focused efforts have seen the Bahamas gain a strong foothold in the Brazilian market. And while wealth management is the bedrock of the Bahamas international financial services offerings, it is the jurisdiction’s funds industry and its innovative product offerings that are at the leading edge of its growing business from LATAM. Brazil in particular has become an increasingly important market for The Bahamas, the result of a consistent and dedicated focus on assisting with satisfying the sophisticated requirements of a jurisdiction whose hedge funds number in the region of 13,000. It would not be overreaching to estimate that a large number of the existing funds licensed in The Bahamas originated – especially using SFMs --to accommodate Brazilian funds, fund managers, investors and strategies. 
 
Under Brazil’s civil code the condominium was the formalization of the concept of joint ownership and administration of property (in all forms) between co-owners within an unincorporated entity. The condominium is not a legal entity separate and apart from co-owners and the administrator is empowered to act on behalf of and represent it in all matters.   As a result of further amendments, a condominium investment fund was created;  this modified the original condominium concept providing that a condominium (in the investment funds context) was a ‘pooling of funds intended for investments in a diversified portfolio composed of financial assets and other instruments available on the financial market.’ 
 
The Bahamas Investment Condominium (ICON) provides an alternative legal structure for investment funds that is inherently familiar to those in Brazil and indeed those in countries which have similar civil law constructs.  It was this commitment to building products that benefit from cultural and legal familiarity that saw The Bahamas introduce foundations law in 2004; the ICON is an extension of this effort.
 
The ICON is defined as a contractual relationship subsisting between investors (called participants), under which the investors agree to pool assets for the purposes of investing those assets as a collective. The structure is then licensed and fully regulated as an investment fund - as is done today using existing vehicles such as the International Business Company, the Exempted Limited Partnership, and the Unit Trust.
 
The ICON is simply a new structuring vehicle that can be licensed as a SMART Fund, Professional Fund or Standard Fund in The Bahamas. It is not a company, not a partnership, and not a trust. It is a pooling mechanism and operating instrument for investment funds.
 
So what are the advantages of an ICON over a company, trust or partnership aside from familiarity?
 
Centralizing “governance” and not just “administration” within a regulated entity helps to achieve international best practices of investment fund governance and operation.  The governing administrator and general administrator of an ICON are regulated, whether in The Bahamas or an equivalent jurisdiction.
The ICON can be simply established in a much more streamlined way than a corporate vehicle.
There is flexibility.  It’s possible to set up an ICON where investors are called on to contribute in the case of negative net equity, before the fund can be deemed insolvent.  It’s also possible to establish an ICON where the liability of the investors is limited. 
 
The ICON shares many features with the Brazilian condominium: the ICON possesses no distinct legal personality save that for the purposes of the legislation it is able to own assets in its name; enter into agreements in its name; and sue and be sued in its name.  The lack of legal personality is addressed by the appointment of an administrator that is empowered to transact in its name, and represent and bind the ICON.
 
The ICON is established by the initial participants signing “governing regulations” which is the governing document of the ICON. The initial participants engage the ICON’s administrator which must be an institution that is regulated by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas as an investment fund administrator under the Investment Funds Act.  The administrator will then prepare a certificate evidencing that the ICON has been established, and which contains the information specified in the schedule attached to the legislation which brought ICON into existence.  This certificate subsequently is signed by the administrator and submitted along with a prescribed fee to the Registrar General for stamping. 
 
As foreshadowed above, the administrator can be a single institution or separate institutions performing two distinct roles – that of “governance” and that of “general administration”.  The role of the governing administrator is similar to that of a director, trustee or general partner.  The governing administrator bears a fiduciary responsibility to participants in the ICON.  The general administrator performs such roles as maintaining the register of participation interests, issuing subscription confirmations etc.
 
A unique ICON feature is the provision for other types of entities - eg companies, unit trusts and exempted limited partnerships - to convert to an ICON by following a defined procedure.  ICON legislation is clear as to the effect of conversion and it is important to note that conversion does not relieve a converted entity from liabilities or obligations incurred preceding the conversion to an ICON.
 
While designed to be reflective of Brazilian requirements, and thus intended to target fund-familiar investors looking to diversify away from their domestic market,  ICON is not solely focussed on Brazil. The Bahamas is also seeing considerable interest in the fund from other Latin American countries because the structure enables the governance, operation and asset optimization in a manner that other structures simply cannot.  Sophisticated investors are able to access and establish offshore funds in a format to which they are already very well accustomed, where the fund administrator assumes a relatively enhanced role encompassing the traditional functions of accounting and investor relations, in addition to fund governance. Thus, a familiar legal structure can be matched up with the regulatory overlay of the Bahamian funds regime, which also has much in common with the Brazilian fund regulatory environment, considering that both countries are Members (A Signatories) of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).
 
It’s important to note that the ICON is simply the structure that underpins the licensing category.  It is possible to license an ICON as a standard fund, professional fund or a SMART Fund.  A good example of how this works well for Brazil is the combination of the ICON with the SMART Fund model 007 license (the “ICON-007”). The beauty of the ICON-007 is the flexibility to customize the fund’s operating structure in a way that efficiently provides for reduced legal and cost concerns. Customization of a fund for asset management requires the consideration of a number of factors, including its proposed strategy, investment policy, investment restrictions, counterparties, liquidity provisions, and total expense ratio. Moreover, the most important factor from the investor’s perspective is often found to be its tax implications and how to structure the fund so that it is tax-neutral and therefore more cost efficient.
 
On this basis, the SFM 007 provides for a regulatory framework that is comparable to the onshore Brazilian multimarket super-qualified fund, which is established as a condominium and may invest up to 100% of its assets outside of Brazil, unlike other types of Brazilian funds. Currently, the minimum initial investment per investor is $1 million Brazilian Reais, which is roughly equivalent to the minimum investment requirement for the SFM 007 (i.e. $0.5 million US dollars).
 
In the current climate, success for an IFC depends on a host of factors but certainly one of them is the ability to develop market-responsive, compliant and innovative products.  The ICON follows in the traditions of the Bahamas Foundation and the Bahamas Executive Entity in being the first of their  kind in the common law world…and that’s quite iconic indeed.

While Bahamian fund administrators will be “much more on the hook” than with similar structures, a senior industry executive says the “rewards” from an ICON-ic launch will be worth the risk.
Aliya Allen, the Bahamas Financial Services Board’s (BFSB) chief executive, told Tribune Business that this nation had found “the perfect product” with which to penetrate the investment fund-driven Brazilian and Latin American markets.
Speaking in a recent interview, and ahead of the Investment Condominium (ICON) structure’s August unveiling in Brazil, Ms Allen said there had already been “a great deal of interest” shown by Brazilian clients, intermediaries and funds professionals.
She added that the ICON’s creation provided further proof of the Bahamas’s ability to innovate and develop unique products without compromising this nation’s regulatory reputation and strength.
The ICON is now in the final industry consultation stages before being presented to Cabinet, and Ms Allen said it provided an ideal vehicle to penetrate Brazil, the Bahamian financial services industry’s prime target in recent years.
“I think the challenge is to create a fund for an environment that is very funds driven, that  is very familiar to Brazilian investors and managers, and which accommodates their needs for portfolio diversification,” Ms Allen told Tribune Business.
“We think that we’ve found the perfect product to do so. For marketing purposes we’re calling it the ICON.  Without selling it too high, it refers to innovation and what we think is the potential for growth in the funds industry as a result.”
The ICON is designed to be fully compliant with Brazilian laws and operate like one of that nation’s products, so is thus intended to target fund-familiar investors looking to diversify away from their domestic market.
“We know we have Brazilians interested in the product already, who are looking to set up funds,” Ms Allen added, “and some are saying they are just waiting for us to launch.

“There is a great deal of interest in the fund.... I think we’re one of the only jurisdictions that develop this type of product, and we think that even though we designed the ICON with Brazil in mind, there’s also a lot of interest in the fund from Latin American countries.
Ms Allen said the ICON would be regulated by the Securities Commission like any other Bahamas-domiciled investment fund structure - a further attraction for investors. She added that the new fund could be incorporated as either a Standard Fund or Professional Fund, or under any of the existing SMART fund templates.
Outlining its main features, Ms Allen said that while the ICON was “not a legal person separate from the investors”, it still retained the features of a ‘corporate personality’, such as the ability to be bound by contracts.
The ICON’s Bahamas-based administrator will act in its name, or on its behalf, placing much more of the compliance/regulatory burden on their shoulders compared to other investment fund structures.
“Because the administrator in the Investment Condominium is given much more responsibility, we do have administrators much more on the hook than perhaps the other structures,” Ms Allen told Tribune Business.
“That’s largely because we don’t have a Board of Directors [for the fund] per se. But we think the rewards will be worth it in terms of increased business.”
The BFSB chief executive added that unlike the Bahamas’ traditional wealth management and asset protection products, the ICON was designed for collective investment and to generate positive returns.
And its launch, targeted for the BFSB’s next promotional trip to Brazil on August 9-15, will also boost this nation’s reputation as an innovator.
“I think it demonstrates that the Bahamas is adaptive, that it is flexible, that it is looking to innovate while not sacrificing the regulatory strength and standing of this jurisdiction,” Ms Allen told Tribune Business.
She added that it also answered the call made by Sean McWeeney QC, Graham Thompson & Co partner and Prime Minister Perry Christie’s key adviser, for more innovation by the Bahamas in financial services industry,
Describing his call at the recent Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP) Caribbean conference as “a timely message”, Ms Allen added: “It’s very tempting in challenging times to sort of draw down or draw back on marketing and promotional efforts, and investments you make into new products, as you tend to think you need to retrench.”
Yet the Bahamas had set this “conventional wisdom” aside to focus on developing new products, services and policies to spurt growth in its financial services industry.

The ICON

The Investment Condominium (ICON) continues The Bahamas’ commitment to bringing to market client responsive legislation.  The ICON provides an alternative legal structure for investment funds.



	Download the ICON FACT Sheet
	

FACT Sheet - English
FACT Sheet - Portuguese
FACT Sheet - Spanish



The ICON is the legal structure underpinning the investment fund in the same way as investment funds are legally organized as companies, exempted limited partnerships and unit trusts.  The ICON’s purpose is tied to its operation as an investment fund and is defined as the contractual relationship subsisting between participants agreeing to the pooling of assets for the purpose of investing those assets collectively.  It possesses no distinct legal personality save that for the purposes of the legislation it is able to hold assets in its name; enter into agreements in its name; and sue and be sued in its name.  The lack of legal personality is addressed by the appointment of an administrator that is empowered to transact in its name, and represent and bind the ICON.


A unique feature of the Investment Condominium Act is the provision for other types of entities - e.g. companies, unit trusts and exempted limited partnerships - to convert to an ICON by following a defined procedure.  The ICON demonstrates The Bahamas’ keen understanding of the regulatory environment and the needs of the clients we service.

ICON Risk-Managed Balanced Fund seeks modest capital appreciation and to maximize realized gains.    The Fund uses a quantitative methodology to identify securities ICON believes are underpriced relative to value.  It seeks modest capital appreciation and income by normally investing no less than 25%, and up to 75%, of the market value of its assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in debt securities traded in U.S. markets. To maintain a balance between debt and equity, the Fund will correspondingly invest no less than 25% and no more than 75% in equity securities traded in U.S. markets, including common stocks and preferred stocks of any market capitalization. To manage the risk of holding equity securities, the Fund may continue to write call options or purchase put options on the securities or securities indexes. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in non-investment grade U.S. dollar denominated bonds. 
    There are risks involved with mutual fund investing, including the risk of loss of principal. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results. Call options involve certain risks, such as limited gains and lack of liquidity of the underlying securities, and are not suitable for all investors.  An investment concentrated in sectors and industries may involve greater risk and volatility than a more diversified investment. There are risks associated with Small and Mid Cap investing such as less liquidity, limited product lines, and small market share.  






















   Investing in securities involves inherent risks, including the risk that you can lose the value of your investment. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful results.  Consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and share classes of each ICON Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus, summary prospectus and the statement of additional information contain this and other information about the Funds; please read the prospectus, summary prospectus and the statement of additional information carefully before investing.

                Top 4 Consumer Defensive Mutual Funds (PGCOX, RYPDX)            


    By Melissa Horton | September 15, 2015 — 11:15 AM EDT    






Share















































Companies that fall under the purview of the consumer defensive category are also known as consumer staples companies, and they include securities of businesses that provide consumers with products and services that are not affected by seasonal or cyclical shifts in the overall market. Consumer staples include products that meet everyday needs, such as utilities; food and beverages; health care; and other nondurable goods such as personal hygiene products. Investing in defensive stocks provides investors an opportunity to participate in a specific equity market that has a long-standing history of financial stability due to constant consumer demand, regardless of market movement or downturns in other equity sectors. Additionally, consumer staples companies are often large in terms of market capitalization and are able to provide investors with consistent dividend payouts.
While the consumer defensive sector helps in creating a fairly conservative portfolio that is able to withstand recessionary periods within the broader equity market, investors should keep in mind that there is still risk involved. Companies that provide consumer staples often lag in performance when the market is doing well, resulting in lower returns than other equity positions. Investors seeking exponential growth within a portfolio do not turn to consumer staples to achieve that end, but, rather, they utilize these stocks to stabilize an asset allocation during times of market volatility. As an equity position, consumer staples stocks are utilized most effectively as a long-term investment in a portfolio that provides exposure to other equity and bond holdings in both domestic and international markets. Mutual funds with a focus on consumer defensive stocks offer an easy way for investors to participate in the sector while managing overall portfolio risk.
Fidelity Select Consumer Staples Portfolio
The Fidelity Select Consumer Staples Portfolio is managed and supported by Fidelity Investments, a leading provider of professionally managed pooled investments to both individual and institutional investors. The mutual fund has an inception date of December 2004, and since that time has been managed by Robert A. Lee. It seeks to provide investors capital appreciation over a long-term time horizon by investing a minimum of 80% of fund assets in securities of companies engaged in the consumer defensive sector. Companies included in the fund's investment mix are involved in the manufacture, sale or distribution of everyday items in both the domestic and foreign markets. The fund's management team utilizes fundamental analysis to determine each companies' industry position as well as its financial stability and strength. As of September 2015, total investor assets within the fund equal $2.70 billion.
The Fidelity Select Consumer Staples Portfolio has generated an annualized 10-year return of 10.91%, which is the highest in the consumer defensive mutual fund category. It has an expense ratio of 1.05%, which is slightly lower than the consumer defensive category average expense ratio of 1.27%. Investors purchasing the mutual fund are charged an upfront sales load of 5.75%, although no deferred sales charges are assessed at the time shares are redeemed. A minimum investment of $2,500 is required as an initial purchase in a nonqualified account, while $500 is required for an IRA. The fund includes 75.29% domestic common stock holdings, with the remaining fund assets invested in foreign issuers. Top holdings within the Fidelity Select Consumer Staples Portfolio include CVS Health Corporation at 11.05%; Procter & Gamble Company at 9.71%; PepsiCo, Inc. at 9.05%; Kroger Company at 6.71%; and Mead Johnson Nutrition Company at 4.4%.
Putnam Global Consumer Fund
The Putnam Global Consumer Fund has an inception date of December 2008 and has been managed by Walter Scully since that time. The fund is provided to investors through the Putnam family of funds, and the investment management team seeks to generate capital appreciation within the mutual fund by investing substantially all fund assets in consumer defensive and consumer discretionary equities. The majority of the fund's $29.5 million in assets are used to purchase common stock in both growth and value-tilted companies in the large- or mid-cap space.
Companies included in the fund are explicitly engaged in the manufacture, sale or distribution of consumer staples or consumer discretionary products, with 39.21% invested in foreign issuers. This nondiversified fund implements fundamental analysis to determine which companies have favorable investment potential to meet the investment objective of the fund for the long-term.
As of September 2015, the Putnam Global Consumer Fund has generated a five-year annualized return of 15.42% and has an expense ratio of 1.29%. Investors are assessed an upfront sales charge of 5.75% for all new investments, but there is no deferred sales charge placed on redemption. Putnam does not require investors to have a specific amount as a minimum investment into the fund. The investment mix within the mutual fund is dispersed among consumer discretionary stocks at 48.57% and consumer defensive holdings at 29.48%. Top holdings within The Putnam Global Consumer Fund include Amazon.com, Inc. at 6.61%; Coty, Inc. at 3.65%; Philip Morris International, Inc. at 3.54%; Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. at 3.52%; and NESTLE SA at 3.42%.
Rydex Consumer Products Fund
The Rydex Consumer Products Fund was established in 2004 and has been managed by Ryan A. Harder since 2010. Made available to investors through the Rydex Funds organization, this fund seeks capital appreciation by investing the majority of fund assets in equity securities of companies that are traded in the United States. Typically, a minimum of 80% of the fund's $280.44 million investor assets are used to purchase securities of consumer products companies with a focus on small- and mid-sized market capitalization. The fund is nondiversified, and investment managers have the ability to invest in derivatives such as futures contracts, options on securities and stock indexes in addition to common stock positions.
As of September 2015, the Rydex Consumer Products Fund has generated a 10-year annualized return of 9.85%, with an expense ratio of 1.6%. As a load mutual fund, investors are charged an upfront fee of 4.75% for new investments into the fund, and a minimum deposit of $2,500 is required for nonqualified accounts. The majority of the fund's holdings are in domestic equities, with only 6.89% invested in foreign issuers. Top positions within this fund include Procter & Gamble Company at 4.93%; Coca-Cola Company at 4.74%; PepsiCo, Inc. at 4.24%: Philip Morris International, Inc. at 4.14%; and Altria Group, Inc. at 3.84%.
ICON Consumer Staples Fund
The ICON Consumer Staples Fund is supported and managed by the ICON Funds group, and Mick Kuehn is the leader of the fund's portfolio management team. Established in 2010, this fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing a minimum of 80% of fund assets in the equity securities of companies that operate within the consumer staples sector. Both common stock and preferred stock may be included within the fund's investment mix, and there are no restrictions placed on the fund manager as it relates to market capitalization. As of September 2015, this nondiversified fund manages $11.68 million in assets.
The ICON Consumer Staples Fund has generated a 10-year annualized return of 6.01% for investors, with an expense ratio of 1.75%. Investors are charged an upfront sales load of 5.75% on new investments, although no deferred sales charges are assessed at the time of redemption. A minimum investment of $1,000 is required for both nonqualified accounts and IRAs. Top holdings within the fund include CVS Health Corporation at 8.56%; Tyson Foods, Inc. at 6.56%; Reynolds American, Inc. at 5.86%; Church & Dwight Company, Inc. at 4.8%; and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. at 4.66%.
