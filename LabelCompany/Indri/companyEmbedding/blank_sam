Our service includes a dedicated case manager to physically process the SAM paperwork on the client’s behalf.

Why Register

The federal government purchases products and services from just about every industry, from space ship parts to staplers, but in order to do business with the federal government, you must have an active SAM registration. The government makes the registration forms available for free, but completing the SAM Registration on your own can take between 20 and 40 hours — and, making sure your Registration is current and complete can take even longer. In 2016, the General Services Administration (GSA) made 77 client-facing enhancements and changes to the System for Award Management (SAM), including seven revisions to FAR subpart 4,18, FAR 52.204-17, FAR 52.204-3, and FAR 52.212-3. These changes affected the type of information a company must submit when completing a SAM Registration. For companies with current SAM Registrations at the time these regulation changes went into effect, the SAM Registration had to be updated to remain in compliance. The GSA also made an estimated 500 changes to Schedules in place during 2016, and we made sure that our clients with affected Schedules remained in compliance with these changes.
Simplified Acquisition Program

Our Simplified Acquisition Program helps get your products and/or services in front of the right government buyers and build your government brand. It is designed to help small and large businesses acquire no-bid contracts between $3,500 and $150,000. The better your business is marketed, and the better your name recognition, the more likely a government buyer will remember your name when reviewing bids. USFCR will qualify your business for the program to determine if is is an option for your business.

Advanced Federal Procurement Data Search

Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Advanced Federal Procurement Data Search (AFPDS) makes available in one place information about available opportunities in real time. Using our data search gives you information BEFORE the information is available elsewhere. Set up bid alert notifications to alert you each time a solicitation is posted for which you’re qualified to bid. Review the history of that specific opportunity, including when it was last offered and the company who won it. And identify the key buyers in your industry and how to best contact them. No other product gives you all of this information in one place. Our technology product will set you apart from your competition and give you a chance to thoroughly research and put together a competitive bid before your competition even knows that the opportunity is available.

About US Federal Contractor Registration

US Federal Contractor Registration is the world’s largest third-party registration firm. It helps business owners register to do business with the federal government; is a platinum rated D&B rated company; and has completed more than 65,000 federal registrations for federal contractors, nonprofits, state and local agencies, and even for the U.S. government.
The government won’t help you complete the registration, and it won’t tell you when you’ve submitted incorrect information. A business that submits incomplete or incorrect registration information can’t do business with the federal government until the information is complete and/or correct. US Federal Contractor Registration, the world’s largest third-party registration firm, can do it for you. It also can handle your mandatory SAM Registration renewal each year, enroll you in its Simplified Acquisition Program, make sure you’re qualified for all applicable set-asides, train you on submitting bids, and so much more. For more information, call a case manager today at 877-252-2700 ext. 1.

Overview:SP58015 Finger sam splint blank SAM Splint is one of the most popular emergency splints in the world.The SAM(Structural Aluminum Malleable) Splints are used world wide as a quick and creative way to immobilize injured joints in emergency and remote situations. They are durable, waterproof, reusable, lightweight, and are invisible on x-rays. They are an ideal splint for trauma first aid kits.The SAM Splint contains all the properties of the many other splints that it replaces.The SAM splint is constructed of .02 strips of soft aluminum with a polyvinyl coating. This metal presents no impediment to X-rays. When folded into a "structural bend" longitudinally the splint becomes quite rigid and easily supports the leg, forearm or humerus. It can also be contoured and crimped to stabilize the cervical spine. The coating on the SAM Splint does not stain and the splint is reusable with proper cleaning. Available in orange or gray.Five different size available to meet all your needs.The 4.25"×36" universal SAM splint is the most commonly used size suitable for adults and children. The 4.25"×18" SAM splint is useful for adult upper extremities, adult ankles when used in pairs, and in children upper and lower extremity injuries. The 4.25"×9" SAM splint is used for wrist support or for IV boards. The XL SAM Splint is 5.5"×36" wide, used for improved support and immobilization of larger individuals. Also available the smallest size finger SAM splint 4.25"×1.96".HighlightsWaterproof, easy to clean.Re-use and re-shape for multiple uses.Lightweight and compact, easy to pack and transport.Latex free.Radiolucent, splints can remain taped to injured extremities during X-rays.Fastens in place with tape or wrap of choice, no extra equipment needed.Not affected by extreme temperatures or altitudes.Closed-cell foam allows easy cleaning and disinfection, material compatible with all standard cleaning solutions.Provides added stability for all limbs including the neck.Protect and stabilize injured fingers, wrist, arms and legs.One 36" SAM splint immobilizes most bones in the human body.Affixes with any tape or wrap.Do you notine?The SAM SPLINT is extremely moldable, and soft enough to cut with ordinary household scissors. The result: with the proper choice of curves outlined in the training guide, almost any bone in the body can be splinted. It’s even possible to use the SAM splint to create an emergency cervical collar for neck injuries.Tech specs  Finger SAM splint, blank printing (SP58015)Dimension:4.25"×1.96"Color:orange/greyNet weight:0.2ozAppreance:flatPacking:3000pcs/CTNPacking dimension:60×50×37cmGross weight:22kg

ConsumerLab.com Answers


Question:


Are enterically coated supplements better than non-enterically coated ones?


Answer:

Enteric coatings help protect supplement ingredients from being released in the stomach and keep them away from stomach acid and enzymes. This allows the supplement to stay intact until it reaches the less acidic small intestine (where most nutrient absorption takes place).  An enteric coating may also be desirable for ingredients which, for some people, otherwise cause an unpleasant aftertaste. Consequently, with ingredients that need protection it is sometimes worthwhile to purchase an enterically coated supplement. However, enteric coatings are not always necessary or beneficial, and, in some case, may just be an expensive gimmick. There are also some concerns about enteric coatings of which you should be aware. See the full answer (with information about enteric coatings for fish oil, marine oils, probiotics, garlic, and SAMe)>>

Question:


I take fluoxetine (Prozac), a SSRI drug to treat depression. Are there supplements I should avoid, or be taking, due to this drug?


Answer:

Fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil) and other selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs can be affected by taking supplements and can affect your ability to absorb certain vitamins and minerals. Certain herbal supplements, such as St. John's wort and Garcinia cambogia (HCA), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome associated with SSRIs.  Other supplements, like 5-HTP, and SAMe, may also increase this risk. 

On the other hand, folic acid, a B vitamin, may be beneficial for some people taking an SSRI.

These interactions are explained in the SSRIs article, which is part of the extensive Drug Interactions section of our website (where you can look up interaction for other drugs you may be taking).

Question:


I've read about several different forms of SAMe.  Is one form better than another? 


Answer:

SAMe is sold in different forms, depending on the compound used to stabilize it and help prevent degradation. Details about the various forms (tosylate, disulfate tosylate, disulfate ditosylate, and 1,4-butanedisulfonate), including evidence and what to look for on the label, are discussed in the SAMe Supplements Review >>

Question:


Is Rhodiola rosea effective for depression and does it have other uses? Will ConsumerLab.com be testing these supplements?


Answer:

Evidence from small studies (including one recently supported by the National Institutes of Health) suggests that extracts made from Rhodiola rosea (also known as roseroot) may have a modest benefit in depression. It is not as effective as anti-depressant medication but poses less risk of side-effects. There is some preliminary evidence it may also be modestly helpful for people with mild anxiety. Support for some of its other proposed uses - such as fighting fatigue and improving mental acuity - has not been well established. For more about Rhodiola rosea, including the type and dosage used to treat depression, see the full answer >>


ConsumerLab.com has tested popular R. rosea supplements for quality and purity. See the results (including our top picks among Approved products), plus more about the evidence for these and other uses, such as reducing fatigue and improving athletic performance, in the Rhodiola Rosea Supplements Review.


For information about other supplements used for depression, see the Depression article in the Encyclopedia on our site, as well as our product reviews of St. John's Wort Supplements, Fish Oil Supplements, SAMe Supplements and Turmeric/Curcumin Supplements.

Question:


My dog is getting older and his veterinarian recently recommended giving him a glucosamine supplement for his joints. Has ConsumerLab.com tested these, or other supplements for pets? 


Answer:

Yes. ConsumerLab.com has tested glucosamine, as well as a variety of other supplements for pets.


Joint health products containing glucosamine -- as well as chondroitin and/or MSM, are one of the most common supplements given to pets. We've published a complete report, including information about use and evidence, dosage, tips for buying, potential side effects, and our tests of popular products in the Review of Joint Health Supplements for Pets and Animals with Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM. (A separate report on Joint Supplements for people is also available.)


ConsumerLab.com has included supplements specifically for pets within larger reviews focusing on supplements for people in the following reviews: Multivitamins, Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements, and Seed Oils (Flaxseed, Evening Primrose, and Borage), SAMe, and Probiotics.







ConsumerLab.com Answers


Question:


I take a supplement containing a "proprietary formula" which lists many ingredients. Can ConsumerLab test the contents so I'll know the amounts of each ingredient?


Answer:

ConsumerLab.com has long cautioned against purchasing supplements with proprietary formulas and typically does not test them. We may, however, check listed amounts of other key, individually listed ingredients in the same supplement. In some cases, we have found high levels of contaminants which, we suspect, originated from ingredients in a proprietary formula. 

The major problem with "proprietary formulas," as well as with proprietary "blends" and "complexes," is that they permit manufacturers to withhold important information about what's really in a product. The company only has to list the total amount of formula, not the amount of each ingredient in the formula. The formula's ingredients only have to be listed in weight order, i.e., based on their relative contribution to the weight of the formula.  Furthermore, the formula may change over time without you necessarily knowing.


Proprietary formulas are often developed around an expensive ingredient, like CoQ10, because this allows a company to use less of the expensive ingredient, creating a formula in which the expensive ingredient is just a small part of the formula.  We have seen this with ingredients such as chondroitin in joint supplements, and SAMe. We also see proprietary formulas marketed for uses such as cognitive enhancement, nerve pain, or weight loss where a company may try to impress the consumer with a laundry list of ingredients having only shreds of evidence relating to the intended use. In most cases, the formulas themselves have not been clinically tested.

ConsumerLab.com Answers


Question:


Which supplements help for osteoarthritis of the hip?


Answer:

Several supplements may modestly reduce pain or improve other symptoms of hip osteoarthritis, which is inflammation caused by damage or "wearing away" of cartilage in the hip. Use the links below for more information.


SAMe supplements have been shown to reduce joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis of the hip, and may be as effective as many of the leading anti-inflammatory drugs.


Ginger may modestly reduce  pain and disability in people with hip osteoarthritis. 

A branded enzyme supplement containing bromelain, trypsin and other ingredients, Wobenzyme, was found in one clinical study to reduced pain and stiffness, and improved function in men and women with hip osteoarthritis just as well as a prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.


One small study found that, compared to fish oil, a formula containing green-lipped mussel oil (a omega-3 fatty acids EPA + DHA), olive oil and vitamin E (Omega XL) reduced pain and improved physical function in men and women with osteoarthritis of the hip. However, there are no studies comparing this formula with a placebo for hip osteoarthritis. (Although there is evidence that fish oil supplements may help to reduce pain due to rheumatoid arthritis, there is not enough evidence to suggest its helpful for osteoarthritis of the hip. )


There is some evidence that collagen hydrolysate may reduce pain associated with hip osteoarthritis.


Tart cherry juice has been found to reduce markers of inflammation, but not pain, in people with osteoarthritis, although the type (knee or hip) was not specified.


Glucosamine and chondroitin are popular supplements for joint health and some early clinical research suggested a benefit, however, more recent and larger clinical studies have tended to show little or no benefit for osteoarthritis of the hip.


There is mixed/preliminary evidence that other supplements, such as white willow, rosehip, cat's claw, devil's claw and avocado/soybean unsaponifiables may be beneficial for hip osteoarthritis. These are discussed in the Encyclopedia article about Osteoarthritis.


Supplements such as curcumin, boswellia, MSM and ashwagandha, which have shown some promise for helping with knee osteoarthritis do not appear to have been studied in well-controlled clinical trials for hip osteoarthritis.

Make sure the SAM-e supplement you take passed our test and quality rating and is right for you!
                                    Isn't your health worth it?
















SAM-e is involved in many functions in the body and, as a supplement, has been shown to be helpful in reducing the pain of osteoarthritis as well as improving mood in major depression. But which SAM-e supplements are best? 
 ConsumerLab.com selected 10 SAM-e supplements and tested them to see whether they contained their claimed amounts of SAM-e, and if the enteric coatings (which protect SAM-e in the stomach) worked properly. One product was discovered to contain only 77% of its listed SAM-e.
SAM-e can be expensive, with products costing as much as $3 per day. Among the products which passed testing (including three products tested through CL's voluntary Quality Certification Program), CL determined which provided the best value. It found three products which passed all tests and provided 400 mg of high-quality SAM-e for as little as 51 to 63 cents. In addition, each was enteric-coated to protect SAM-e from stomach acids and sold in blister packs to prevent spoilage from moisture, as SAMe is a sensitive compound.

In this comprehensive report about SAM-e (also called SAMe, S-adenosyl-methionine, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine), you'll get test results and quality ratings for 13 SAM-e supplements. You'll learn:


Which SAM-e supplements passed or failed testing 
        
Direct comparisons and quality ratings of SAM-e supplements, including cost comparisons showing you can pay anywhere from 51 cents to over $3 for the same amount of SAM-e -- it pays to compare prices

Why Register

The federal government purchases products and services from just about every industry, from space ship parts to staplers, but in order to do business with the federal government, you must have an active SAM registration. The government makes the registration forms available for free, but completing the SAM Registration on your own can take between 20 and 40 hours — and, making sure your Registration is current and complete can take even longer. In 2016, the General Services Administration (GSA) made 77 client-facing enhancements and changes to the System for Award Management (SAM), including seven revisions to FAR subpart 4,18, FAR 52.204-17, FAR 52.204-3, and FAR 52.212-3. These changes affected the type of information a company must submit when completing a SAM Registration. For companies with current SAM Registrations at the time these regulation changes went into effect, the SAM Registration had to be updated to remain in compliance. The GSA also made an estimated 500 changes to Schedules in place during 2016, and we made sure that our clients with affected Schedules remained in compliance with these changes.
Simplified Acquisition Program

Our Simplified Acquisition Program helps get your products and/or services in front of the right government buyers and build your government brand. It is designed to help small and large businesses acquire no-bid contracts between $3,500 and $150,000. The better your business is marketed, and the better your name recognition, the more likely a government buyer will remember your name when reviewing bids. USFCR will qualify your business for the program to determine if is is an option for your business.

Advanced Federal Procurement Data Search

Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Advanced Federal Procurement Data Search (AFPDS) makes available in one place information about available opportunities in real time. Using our data search gives you information BEFORE the information is available elsewhere. Set up bid alert notifications to alert you each time a solicitation is posted for which you’re qualified to bid. Review the history of that specific opportunity, including when it was last offered and the company who won it. And identify the key buyers in your industry and how to best contact them. No other product gives you all of this information in one place. Our technology product will set you apart from your competition and give you a chance to thoroughly research and put together a competitive bid before your competition even knows that the opportunity is available.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
