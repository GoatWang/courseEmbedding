Brookfield Property Partners L.P., BPY,  earnings, covered call










Trading Options: Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (NYSE:BPY) : Using Covered Calls to Outperform the Stock






Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (NYSE:BPY) : Using Covered Calls to Outperform the Stock
	Date Published:
	
		2017-07-22	


PREFACE

		While covered calls are one of the most commonly used option strategies, it turns out we need to be clever in how we treat earnings in order to maximize the strategy in Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (NYSE:BPY) . Even further, if we don't do this analysis, we can easily dismiss some worthy covered call opportunities as losers. This is one of those cases.
		
STORY

		There's a lot less 'luck' involved in successful option trading than many people realize and we're going to review that right now for BPY. 
		Let's first examine a two-year back-test of a covered call strategy with some simple rules:
		
		* Trade monthly options (roll the trade every 30-days).
		
		* Avoid earnings

		* Test this strategy for two-years		
		Here's how this quick set up looks in the back-tester:
		


		If we do this test, it turns out the best covered call to sell is out of the money with a delta of 20. Any delta below 50 is usually out of the money and certainly a 20 delta is out of the money.
		
RESULTS

		If we do a covered call in Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (NYSE:BPY)  over the last two-years but always skip earnings we get these results:
		



Buy BPY Stock, Sell 20 Delta Call


* Trade Frequency: 30 Days


* Always Avoid Earnings





Gross Gain:
$1,452


Gross Loss:
-$808


Covered Call Return:
 52.1% 


Stock Return:
23.3%





Out-performance:
 28.8% 




		That tile tells us two critical pieces of information. First, we see a very nice covered call result with a 52.1% return. But, just as important, we also see that 
		the 52.1% return in the covered call considerably out-performs Brookfield Property Partners L.P. stock over the last two-years, which hit 23.3%.
		
		In total we're looking at a 28.8% out-performance while taking less risk than owning the stock outright and
		always avoiding earnings risk.
					
GOING FURTHER

			While out-performing the stock and avoiding the risk of earnings is a powerful implementation of a covered call, we actually did even better. Next we do the same back-test, 
			but this time we only trade earnings. That is, we open our position two-days before earnings, let the event occur, and close the position two-days after earnings.
			
			Here's the set-up -- very easy. Just click the appropriate buttons.:
			


			Now we examine the results for that same 20 delta covered call.
			



Buy BPY Stock, Sell 20 Delta Call


* Trade Frequency: 30 Days


* Only Trade Earnings





Gross Gain:
$69


Gross Loss:
-$420


Covered Call Return:
 -28.7% 




			Now we see why avoiding earnings was so powerful. Holding the covered call in Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (NYSE:BPY)  through earnings under-performed the stock and certainly under-performed a covered call that avoided this risk.
			In fact, our strategy to avoid earnings beat the strategy held only during earnings by a whopping 80.8%. It could have been so easy to miss this result without
			diving just a little deeper than the standard option analysis.
			
CLARITY

			For some clarity we simply chart the returns of the stock, the covered call strategy with earnings and the one that avoids earnings, below.
			


Brookfield Property Partners L.P. Stockand Covered Call Returns %






			Note the out-performance we get in Brookfield Property Partners L.P. by being methodical in our approach and in this case avoiding the risk of earnings.
				

				
				
		
TRADING TRUTHS

		Going through this practice with Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (NYSE:BPY)  reveals that the entire concept of 'options expert' has been made made overly
		complicated.  Below, we go the final step (with a video).

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
