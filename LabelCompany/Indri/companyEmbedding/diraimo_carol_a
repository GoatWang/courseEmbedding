Carol DiRaimo Joins Jack in the Box Inc. as Vice President of 
      Investor Relations & Corporate Communications






July 08, 2008 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jack in the Box Inc. (NYSE: JBX) today announced that Carol DiRaimo has 
      joined the company as vice president of investor relations and corporate 
      communications. She is assuming the investor relations responsibilities 
      currently performed by Harold Sachs, who is retiring as vice president 
      of investor relations and treasurer, effective Dec. 31, 2008. The 
      company is currently exploring options for the treasury role.
    


      DiRaimo has more than 19 years of experience in the restaurant industry. 
      She was most recently the vice president of investor relations for 
      Applebee’s International, Inc. During her 
      14-year career with Applebee’s, the last seven 
      of which she managed the investor relations function, DiRaimo served in 
      a variety of capacities, including financial planning and reporting, 
      treasury, and corporate analysis. Before joining Applebee’s 
      in 1993, she worked at Gilbert/Robinson Restaurants Inc., which operated 
      more than 100 casual and specialty restaurants. A certified public 
      accountant, DiRaimo also has six years of public accounting experience 
      with Deloitte.
    

“Carol has a tremendous depth of experience in 
      all areas of finance, accounting and investor relations and has earned 
      an outstanding reputation within the investment community,” 
      said Linda A. Lang, chairman and chief executive officer of Jack in the 
      Box Inc. “She’ll be 
      instrumental in building upon the strong relationships we currently have 
      with the investor and analyst communities.”


      DiRaimo has earned numerous accolades in the field of investor 
      relations. She was honored as “Best Investor 
      Relations Officer” for a small- to mid-cap 
      company by Investor Relations Magazine, in association with Barron’s, 
      for four consecutive years – 2004, 2005, 
      2006 and 2007. During this period, Investor Relations Magazine 
      also honored Applebee’s for “Best 
      Overall Investor Relations” for a small-cap 
      company. The awards are internationally recognized as the most 
      prestigious and accurate measure of outstanding performance within the 
      investor relations community. Institutional Investor Magazine 
      named Applebee’s one of America’s 
      Most Shareholder-Friendly Companies in 2006, and ranked Applebee’s 
      investor relations as best in the restaurant industry in 2005 and 2006.
    

      DiRaimo holds a bachelor’s degree in 
      accounting from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and received her 
      Executive MBA from Rockhurst University in Kansas City. In 2006, DiRaimo 
      was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Investor Relations 
      Institute (NIRI), where she serves as chairperson of the audit 
      committee. In addition, she co-chaired NIRI’s 
      2006 Annual Conference, which attracted more than 1,500 investor 
      relations professionals.
