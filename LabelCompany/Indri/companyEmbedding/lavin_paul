                           "Many ADHD children become markedly despondent as they move from one developmental stage to the next. They engage in various
                              forms of oppositional behavior believing they simply can not succeed. In short, they have given up. In order to alter this
                              course, ADHD children must learn to replace hopelessness with hopefulness. The insidious and often unrecognized depression
                              blocking this transition must be addressed. The purpose of this book is to provide parents, educators, and mental health professionals
                              with a conceptual and practical framework for identifying and correcting this emotional virus, which can undermine even the
                              most well-designed and implemented therapeutic and educational program."--Jacket

Item Description: Leonine Publishers LLC, 2017. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. Will your eternal soul gain a cap and gown? Open Letters to Catholic Graduates is unique in its emphasis on the transition between college and the secular world, an emphasis sorely needed for the young Catholic today. Graduates are confronted with the task of facing the world and making something of themselves, which can be simultaneously exciting and perilous. Graduates today will certainly feel the strong pull of the secular world and its allurements, but Dr. Lavin reminds them to not lose focus. Open Letters to Catholic Graduates exhorts graduates from high school and college to reaffirm their essential mission in life: to get to heaven. In his Open Letters, Lavin writes on topics of taking salvation seriously, forming true friendships, the dangers of capital sins, using psychology as a helpful aid, one s final end, and more. Anyone transitioning from their stage in life into a morally ambiguous environment should read this book.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9780991195886

WrestleMania Promos Take Over Orlando

A week of magic and mayhem has ended as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) presented WrestleMania 33 – professional wrestling’s annual promo-filled Super Bowl inside Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. And, Counselor was on the scene to see all of the promotions that sponsors and hosts were running.

An all-time Orlando Citrus Bowl attendance record of 75,245 fans from 50 states and 62 countries made the pilgrimage to witness their favorite athletes clash at the nearly seven-hour event. WrestleMania 33 gained a record 18 million social media fan engagements, up 66% from last year. Digital and social media video views reached 133 million, skyrocketing 105% from 2016. For the first time, WrestleMania was made available in China on a pay-per-view basis via PPTV’s digital platform.
“WrestleMania made a triumphant return to Orlando and again broke multiple records,” said WWE Executive Vice President of Special Events John Saboor in a press release. “This success would not have been possible without the tireless support of Mayor Dyer, the Local Organizing Committee and all of the public and private sector partners throughout Central Florida.”
WrestleMania 33 grossed $14.5 million in revenue, down from the company’s record $17.3 million for last year’s event. It also generated an estimated $125 million in economic impact for the Central Florida area. That’s why each year cities bid on hosting the pop culture extravaganza – New Orleans has been chosen over Philadelphia and Minneapolis to hold WrestleMania 34 next year as part of the city’s tricentennial celebration.

"WrestleMania Week was a tremendous success for the city of Orlando and it was an honor to host WWE and their fans back in our community," said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. "This is a testament to the investments we've made in our community venues that continue to attract these showcase events and solidify Orlando as the nation's leading sports and entertainment destination." Orlando is home to many WWE operations including its developmental brand NXT and its training facility the WWE Performance Center.
As soon as fans arrived at Orlando International Airport, they were greeted by WrestleMania signs at baggage claim and rental car stations. The streets of downtown Orlando were plastered in WrestleMania banners showcasing top stars such as Brock Lesnar and Goldberg. There was even a 30-foot-wide, 12-foot-high championship belt replica on display at Lake Eola.  
Throughout the week, fans mobbed the Orange County Convention Centerin Orlando for WrestleMania Axxess, an annual fan fest with autograph signings, exhibits and merchandise. Attendees scooped up hats, shirts, wrist bands, posters, foam hands, and inflatable Bailey buddies, all emblazoned with the WrestleMania and WWE logos. Snickers sponsored the event for the second straight year, giving out free candy bars and sharing clips through social media and YouTube. During the WrestleMania broadcast, an ad featured WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair and WWE Superstars Charlotte and James Ellsworth as part of the “You’re Not You When You're Hungry" campaign.
