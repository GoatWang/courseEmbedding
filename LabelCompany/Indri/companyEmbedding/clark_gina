About

        I'm the product of an engineer and a crafty lady...I guess my parents gave me the skills I have. I can't remember a time in my life where I wasn't creating something-anything.  Painting, drawing, sewing, crocheting...hair and nail enthusiast.  I've always said to myself, "Hey! I can make that!"  And make it, I do....Enjoy!

About


            I'm the product of an engineer and a crafty lady...I guess my parents gave me the skills I have. I can't remember a time in my life where I wasn't creating something-anything.  Painting, drawing, sewing, crocheting...hair and nail enthusiast.  I've always said to myself, "Hey! I can make that!"  And make it, I do....Enjoy!
