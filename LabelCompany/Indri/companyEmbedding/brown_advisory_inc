	We follow a philosophy that low-turnover, concentrated portfolios derived from sound bottom-up fundamental research provide an opportunity for attractive performance results over time. We have a culture and firm equity ownership structure that help us attract and retain professionals who share those beliefs, and we follow a repeatable investment process that helps us stay true to our philosophy.

	We construct balanced portfolios for private clients, nonprofits and institutions depending on the needs of the client. We can be 100% open architecture, using third-party managers only, or we can put together a mix of internal and external strategies, whatever is in the client's best interest.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Our Philosophy
Our Clients
Our Culture
Our History
Our People
 







In 1993, we founded Brown Advisory with a simple vision: to build an investment firm that is entirely focused on making a material and positive difference for our clients over time.
 
























					Thought•ful:



					1. Absorbed in or involving thought.





					/THôtfəl/



					2. Showing consideration for the needs of other people.





	 


(top-left to bottom-right)
	Michael D. Hankin; Daily Research Meeting; Logie Fitzwilliams and Keryn Brock; Ben Griswold; Dune Thorne; Porter Schutt and Bill Dugdale.

	Our mission remains the same today as when we opened our doors: to be a firm where every action we take, every investment strategy we employ, every decision we make, puts clients first. To award professionals an ownership stake in the company so that everyone sees their interests as aligned with our clients' long-term success. To be a firm that you would build for yourself, if given a blank slate. To be relevant to our clients five, 10 and 20 years from now. To be the firm to which all our clients turn and ask: What do you think I should do? In short, to be regarded by our clients as thoughtful investors.

	To fulfill that mission, we have carefully cultivated a culture of putting the needs and aspirations of clients before our own.


					Learn About Our Clients				

















					Brown Advisory's DNA				






	We firmly believe that our cultural DNA distinguishes us from other firms in our industry.


OUR CULTURE:
		Putting Clients First

		This principle pervades everything we do, not only because it is good for business, but also because we truly care about our clients. We feel privileged to work with them, as they do impressive work: raising successful families, building leading businesses, guiding important nonprofits, overseeing pensions that help people retire well and otherwise making a difference in the world. We take personal satisfaction in helping our clients succeed. That is Brown Advisory in a nutshell.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Brown Advisory - Private Clients








Overview
Performance
Advice
Service
 







To invest, advise and serve on your behalf, we at Brown Advisory begin with a simple but important step: We listen—to you.
We build our relationships on a foundation of careful listening, so we can understand each client's specific situation, and the role that they want us to play for them. Some clients are looking for a pure investment advisor, while others may seek more of a "family quarterback"; some clients look to us to manage their money ourselves, while others seek our assistance in selecting top-quality external managers. 

It all begins with listening. We ask you about your concerns, your needs and your hopes so that we can craft a customized plan to deliver the investment performance, strategic advice and client service that you deserve.













Performance



	We strive to help you navigate complex markets to achieve your investment goals. For most clients, we oversee balanced portfolios, while for others we invest in just a specific asset class or a single strategy.

Learn More





Advice



	We act as your advocate, helping you make good decisions on a wide range of challenges from planning issues to philanthropy to family businesses.

Learn More





Service



	We pledge to serve you with proactive attention, clear communication and complete confidentiality.

	We follow a philosophy that low-turnover, concentrated portfolios derived from sound bottom-up fundamental research provide an opportunity for attractive performance results over time. We have a culture and firm equity ownership structure that help us attract and retain professionals who share those beliefs, and we follow a repeatable investment process that helps us stay true to our philosophy.

	We construct balanced portfolios for private clients, nonprofits and institutions depending on the needs of the client. We can be 100% open architecture, using third-party managers only, or we can put together a mix of internal and external strategies, whatever is in the client's best interest.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Brown Advisory - Private Clients








Overview
Performance
Advice
Service
 







To invest, advise and serve on your behalf, we at Brown Advisory begin with a simple but important step: We listen—to you.
We build our relationships on a foundation of careful listening, so we can understand each client's specific situation, and the role that they want us to play for them. Some clients are looking for a pure investment advisor, while others may seek more of a "family quarterback"; some clients look to us to manage their money ourselves, while others seek our assistance in selecting top-quality external managers. 

It all begins with listening. We ask you about your concerns, your needs and your hopes so that we can craft a customized plan to deliver the investment performance, strategic advice and client service that you deserve.













Performance



	We strive to help you navigate complex markets to achieve your investment goals. For most clients, we oversee balanced portfolios, while for others we invest in just a specific asset class or a single strategy.

Learn More





Advice



	We act as your advocate, helping you make good decisions on a wide range of challenges from planning issues to philanthropy to family businesses.

Learn More





Service



	We pledge to serve you with proactive attention, clear communication and complete confidentiality.

The Funds
Fund Performance
Resources



We believe that a disciplined, "bottom-up" research process is the foundation of superior investment performance. Our deep in-house research team combines industry-specific knowledge with in-depth fundamental analysis. Central to our investment process is close collaboration among team members. Our portfolio managers leverage this free exchange of ideas and our extensive network of venture capital and private equity relationships, clients, directors and outside shareholders to uncover investment opportunities.
Brown Advisory is an independent firm where all employees own equity – ensuring that our interests are aligned with those of our mutual fund shareholders. Our independence from investment banking or principal trading interests allows us to challenge conventional wisdom without concern over conflict of interest.
We invite you to learn more about our family of mutual funds.


Welcome to the Brown Advisory family of mutual funds. Our primary goal is simple and straightforward: we are committed to producing sound, risk-adjusted returns over time.

About Brown Advisory Inc


In 1993, we founded Brown Advisory with a simple vision: to build an investment firm that is entirely focused on making a material and positive difference for our clients over time.
Our mission remains the same today as when we opened our doors: to be a firm where every action we take, every investment strategy we employ, every decision we make, puts clients first. To award professionals an ownership stake in the company so that everyone sees their interests as aligned with our clients' long-term success. To be a firm that you would build for yourself, if given a blank slate.To be relevant to our clients five, 10 and 20 years from now. To be the firm to which all our clients turn and ask:What do you think I should do? In short, to be regarded by our clients as thoughtful investors.To fulfill that mission, we have carefully cultivated a culture of putting the needs and aspirations of clients before our own.
