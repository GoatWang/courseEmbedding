An industry leader in warehousing and supply-chain management, Insight Group’s DC Expert is a powerful, affordable productivity tool adopted by blue chip companies around the globe.
The only product on the market to integrate all warehousing management and planning in one tool set, DC Expert gives you the power to maximize space utilization, labor productivity, transportation efficiencies, and measure your operation against global benchmarks in your unique business sector.
Optimize your DC through re-slotting, and realize a 15% decrease in travel distance, a 10% reduction in handling and an increase in cubic utilization by 25%, or more.  Quickly draw your current operation, or design a future operation with the Layout tool, and calculate storage capacity and space utilization through a drag and drop design engine.  No longer will you have to spend hours using a CAD program to get workable designs and plans.  Once you are satisfied with your design, simply apply racking and space costs to compare model vs. actual, or model vs. model.
With its 5 core modules, DC Expert creates rapid operations models, and provides actionable ROI’s for management groups.  Whether you are designing an operation from the ground up, or just looking to optimize your current distribution center, DC Expert is an invaluable tool set for your organization.

INSIGHT GROUP’S KEYS TO SUCCESS:

Always Maintain Communication
You will never feel out-of-the-loop or under-informed, thanks to the Insight Group iterative process. Whether it’s online or in the boardroom, we strive to maintain a healthy flow of communication, so that our project management team can deliver exactly what you need – on time and on budget.

Anticipate and Work Through Changes
Changes are a normal part of doing business. Proper planning and clear communication are key to ensuring minimal changes, but it is sometimes difficult to account for every eventuality at the beginning of a project. It is reasonable to expect minor adjustments and revisions along the way, as part of the original project agreement. If there are major scope changes or new requirements, additional compensation will be required, but Insight Group will work with you to help manage and minimize the impact on time, budget and resource allocations.

Set Milestones to Achieve Success
For longer term (more than a month), or more complex projects, it is recommended that you use milestones to improve project outcome. Milestones serve as checkpoints that allow you to gauge progress and receive essential feedback. We often link compensation to completing key milestones, allowing you better control, while motivating the team to yield higher quality work. It is easy to set up milestones with the Insight Group team – we make sure it happens from thought to finish.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
