Cien is like a Fitbit® for your Sales Team!
 







SIMPLE YET POWERFUL 










OVERVIEW -  THE CIEN APP, A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME Breakthrough Tech delivered by the Cien App to mobile devices that improves your Sales Team’s Productivity using Artificial Intelligence (AI).













DAILY PULSE - CHECK IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNINGCien is like a Fitbit® for your Sales Team! It's a mobile app that you engage with every day to get info and advice that drives the right behavior. Cien has a user-friendly interface with screens tailored for reps, managers and executives. All in real-time!













AUTOMATIC FORECASTING - NOT YOUR GRANDMA'S CRMHumans are really great at pattern recognition. “If I do a lot of this, I can expect that to happen”. But patterns that involve a lot of data cannot easily be digested by the human brain. Traditionally, computers have been great at dealing with a lot of data but have not been able to recognize patterns, just pre-programmed instructions. This limitation has plagued the traditional way Sales Managers have used their CRM to make forecasts.
Cien’s AI engine has the pattern recognition capabilities to take ALL this data into account. This means that we can continually predict what will happen next, including your sales results. If facts change, the forecast changes. Never be surprised by a bad end of quarter again.













TEAM SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - SOFT STUFF WITH A HARD IMPACTMost Sales Teams today use a CRM system and track some KPIs. They are not able to measure all intangible factors such as team mood, product knowledge, work ethic, closing ability & seasonality that greatly affect results. Cien makes that possible. That’s why our motto is “Measure what Matters”.













CIEN MENTOR - YOUR GURU IN A BOXBecause we measure and predict the characteristics that drive productivity, we can also determine the relative importance of those factors for your company given the current situation. Don’t repeat the old playbook when facts on the ground are different. Cien Mentor highlights where the low hanging fruit is for each team member and role, and makes it easy to commit to and track the impact of key initiatives – the key to your next promotion!

 










PRODUCTIVITY METRICS - WHEN YOU CAN MEASURE, YOU CAN MANAGECien is focused on a very measurable metric – your Sales Team’s productivity broken down to individual contributors and across various teams. You will see that metric start increasing and the resulting additional revenue.













INDIVIDUAL FEEDBACK -GET BETTER, FASTThe key to excellence is proper feedback. Cien analyses each team member’s activities and results, providing specific feedback for each team member, that helps both reps and manager to understand where the big opportunities for improvements are.













ROI TRACKING - SHOW ME THE MONEYWouldn’t it be nice for once to be sure the investment you made is truly paying for itself (and more…)? With Cien, ROI tracking is built straight into the product so you and your stakeholders can always see when you reached break even and the total ROI so far.













PLANNING - NO ONE WINS THE BATTLE WITHOUT A PLANShould you spend more on your marketing or hire some more Sales Development Reps? What is the expected ramp up time? How soon before that do I need to adjust my marketing spend? What should I expect to sell in August if I hire 5 more reps? Those are questions every Sales & Marketing leader grapples with. With Cien you finally have intelligent data to back up your decisions with. What’s even better is that as your business evolves, Cien’s planning tools adjust so you are not stuck with an outdated plan.













CUSTOMIZATION - YOUR BUSINESS, YOUR WAYWe understand that your business is unique – as a matter of fact, that’s the whole basis of Cien. Don’t use someone else’s playbook! When you have a unique business, the Cien App adapts to your specific needs. E.g. custom fiscal years, exclude certain groups or processes. Cien is based on Machine Learning and that means that we can “teach” the App your specific rules, to make sure you get the customized and specific advice tailored to improve your situation.

123Product QuestionCIEN product ingredients (self.SkincareAddiction)submitted 2 years ago by pir-annaI've been curious about Lidl's CIEN beauty products for a while now, but couldn't find the ingredients online anywhere. I thought perhaps as a service to SCA-kind I could take pictures of the packaging and then transcribe it to cosDNA - so I did, for a few products. Of note is the Q10 cream, which came out as the best anti-wrinkle cream in a Dutch consumer test (Link is in Dutch) a while ago, scoring much better than for example Lancome's Renergie Multilift which costs a hefty $85. The CIEN cream costs $3. Looking at the ingredients I don't think any of them are for me, but maybe someone else?

Would you like to cross post this to /r/NordicSkincare? (: I think Lidls are pretty common at least in Finland, Sweden and Denmark.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]missblonde 1 point2 points3 points 2 years ago (1 child)I shop in Lidl and have tried their skin care but I do not recommend it.It's highly fragranced and mostly packed in jars.It's average to say the least. Your skin deserves better.

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]pir-anna[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 years ago (0 children)Having run the ingredients through cosDNA I totally agree, and I was suprised to see something that won a consumer test be so heavily fragranced.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
