A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.

Business Continuity Plan - Harbor Investment Advisory












































Menu









Business Continutiy Plan


















 
Business Continuity Plan
Harbor Investment Advisory, LLC
Client Disclosure Statement
Harbor Investment Advisory, LLC has developed a Business Continuity Plan describing how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business.  Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we intend to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur.  With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our Business Continuity Plan.
Contacting Us
If , after a significant business disruption,  you cannot contact us as you usually do at 410-659-8900, or Betsy Brennen at  bbrennen@harborLLC.com , you should call our alternative number 410-504-3088. If you cannot access us through either of those means, you should contact our clearing firm, Pershing, LLC, at 201-413-3635 or www.pershing.com for instructions on how it may provide services to you in the event of a significant business disruption, such as  prompt access to funds and securities, order entry and other trade-related, cash, and security transfer transactions for your account(s).
Our Business Continuity Plan
We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and will respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business.  In short, our Business Continuity Plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Our Business Continuity Plan addresses: data back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical suppliers, contractors, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.
Our clearing firm, Pershing, LLC, backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by our clearing firm that its objective is to restore its own operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new transactions and payments within four hours. Your orders and requests for funds and securities could be delayed during this period.
Varying Disruptions
Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region.  Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe.  In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within the same business day.  In a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and recover and resume business within one business day.  In either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to our clearing firm if necessary, and notify you through our customer emergency number, (410) 504-3088 on how to contact us.  If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customer’s prompt access to their funds and securities.
For more information
If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at 410-659-8900.
This plan is subject to modification, an updated summary will be promptly posted on our Web site and customers may alternatively obtain updated summaries by requesting a written copy by mail.

DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:  Performance calculations are derived from New Harbor's Large Cap and Small/Mid Cap Principal Accounts, managed by Paul Houk. Results from January 2000 to December 2001 are derived from Houk personal accounts managed in this discipline before New Harbor's inception in January 2002. Results are time-weighted rates of return net of commissions and transaction costs. While these are non-fee-paying accounts, results have been presented net of New Harbor's maximum advisory fee of 1.20% per annum, assessed quarterly. Performance results of New Harbor Investment Management, LLC clients will be reduced by New Harbor advisory fees. (For example, an account with a compound annual return of 10% would have increased by 159% over ten years. Assuming an annual advisory fee of 1.00%, this increase would be reduced to 137%.)

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
