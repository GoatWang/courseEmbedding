The Fund intends to concentrate in securities issued by U.S. corporations in the related groups of industries comprising each of the utilities sector and the financial services sector.

The performance data shown represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See performance data current to the most recent month-end, which may be higher or lower than that cited.

Performance figures assume that all distributions are reinvested.

         Morningstar Rating1



       Overall Rating
       

       The fund has not yet been rated by Morningstar.
       


       Overall Ratings are not available.
       












               
       
       What You Should Know
       
    





            

The Fund’s market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session. The Fund’s market price as of and after July 1, 2013, reflects the last sale price in the broad market; Market price prior to July 1, 2013, reflects the last sale price on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV. The Fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time, and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund’s earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes, the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares (up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares) and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares. Such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale. Distributions in any year may include a substantial return-of-capital component. An investment in the fund’s Common shares is subject to investment and market risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund, which are generally traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. These securities will fluctuate in value, and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment, even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. An issuer of securities held by the fund may default, have its credit rating downgraded, or otherwise perform poorly. The fund uses a Credit Facility Agreement (CFA) to increase its assets available for investment. Shareholders bear the fees associated with this leverage and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage. It is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the advisor’s fee. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:

the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares
the risk that the cost of using the CFA will increase with rising interest rates
the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns
the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage, while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed
the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements

Fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage. If the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the CFA is terminated, the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time, incurring tax consequences, and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected.
The fund’s monthly distributions may be from net investment income, capital gains, or return of capital. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. Distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time.
Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable, but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. They frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Specialized funds may carry additional risks.

Under the HTD Plan, the Fund makes monthly distributions of an amount equal to $0.1380 per share. This amount will be paid monthly until further notice.  Distributions under the HTD Plan may consist of net investment income, net realized long-term capital gains, net realized short-term capital gains and, to the extent necessary, return of capital. The Fund may also make additional distributions (i) for purposes of not incurring federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gain of the Fund, if any, not included in such regular distributions and (ii) for purposes of not incurring federal excise tax on ordinary income and capital gain net income, if any, not included in such regular monthly distributions.  The Board may amend the terms of the HTD Plan or terminate the HTD Plan at any time.A portion of a Fund's current distribution may include sources other than net investment income, including a return of capital. Investors should understand that a return of capital is not a distribution from income or gains of a Fund. As required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice with the estimated components of the distribution will be sent to shareholders at the time of payment if it does not consist solely of net investment income. Such notice will also be posted to the Funds' website at www.jhinvestments.com. The notice should not be used to prepare tax returns as the estimates indicated in the notice may differ from the ultimate federal income tax characterization of distributions. After the end of each calendar year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV informing them how to report distributions received during that year for federal income tax purposes.Statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they are subject to uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Fund's control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.An investor should consider a Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.About John Hancock Investments   John Hancock Investments provides asset management services to individuals and institutions through a unique manager-of-managers approach.  A wealth management business of John Hancock Financial, we managed more than $136 billion in assets as of September 30, 2016, across mutual funds, college savings plans, and retirement plans.About John Hancock Financial and Manulife Financial   John Hancock Financial is a division of Manulife Financial, a leading Canada-based financial services group with principal operations in Asia, Canada and the United States.
