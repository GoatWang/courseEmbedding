Whole Foods Market in South Hills to open Jan. 25, 2017
Retailer opens first location in southern Pittsburgh with 40,000-square-foot store
Share:
PITTSBURGH – Whole Foods Market will open its newest location in the Pittsburgh metro on Wed., Jan. 25, at 111 Siena Dr., in Upper St. Clair. Serving the many communities that make up the South Hills, this store will be the go-to destination for shoppers seeking the highest quality natural and organic products available including fresh produce, meat, seafood, prepared foods and grocery items.
“We’re thrilled to serve more customers in Pittsburgh,” said Casey Dill, Store Team Leader who most recently ran the Wexford location and has been with Whole Foods Market since 1990. “Food is such an important part of our lives – whether it’s coming together at the end of the day, snacking during a game-day get together, or celebrating a special occasion. We’re going to be here to help with inspiration, expertise and the highest quality options.”
Every product in a Whole Foods Market store meets rigorous quality standards and is free of artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, preservatives and hydrogenated fats. Frequent shoppers and new customers alike are invited to preview the store on Sunday, Jan. 22, when guided tours will offer opportunities to learn more about the Whole Foods Market mission and sample products. Reservations are required and space is limited. Sign up online here. There are also 40 open team member positions that are currently being filled. More information can be found here.
The community is also invited to join store and company leaders for a traditional bread breaking ceremony at 8:45 a.m. on Jan. 25 to celebrate the grand opening. Further details about the store will be shared in mid-January.
