About Cal-Maine Foods
We are the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the United States. In fiscal 2017, we sold approximately 1,031.1 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 20% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock of approximately 36.1 million layers and 9.5 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S.  Layers are mature female chickens, pullets are female chickens usually under 18 weeks of age, and breeders are male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks.
The Company has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs.  The majority of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and non-specialty eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products.  We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage free, organic and brown eggs as specialty products for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as non-specialty products.  While we report separate sales information for these egg types, there are many cost factors which are not specifically available for non-specialty or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers.
We sell most of our shell eggs in the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors and egg product consumers. Some of our sales are completed through co-pack agreements - a common practice in the industry whereby production and processing of certain products is outsourced to another producer.  The strength of our position is evidenced by having the largest market share in the grocery segment for shell eggs.   We sell shell eggs to a majority of large U.S. food retailers.
We are one of the largest producers and marketers of value-added specialty shell eggs in the U.S. They have been a significant and growing segment of the market in recent years.  A significant number of our food service customers, large restaurant chains, and major retailers, including our largest customers, have committed to exclusive offerings of cage-free eggs by specified future dates. We are working with our customers to ensure a smooth transition in meeting their goals. Our focus for future expansion at our farms will be environments that are cage-free or with equipment that can easily be converted to cage-free, based on a timeline to meet our customer's needs.
In fiscal 2017, specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 43.6% and 3.1% of our shell egg sales dollars, respectively, and accounted for approximately 22.9% and 1.6%, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes. In fiscal 2016, specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 29.1% and 2.7% of our shell egg sales dollars, respectively, and accounted for approximately 22.9% and 2.0%, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes.  Prices for specialty eggs are less volatile than non-specialty shell egg prices and are generally higher due to consumer willingness to pay for the perceived increased benefits from those products. We market our specialty shell eggs under the following brands: Egg-Land's Best®, Land O' Lakes®, Farmhouse®, and 4-Grain®.   We are a member of the Egg-Land's Best, Inc. ("EB") cooperative and produce, market and distribute Egg-Land's Best® and Land O' Lakes®  branded eggs, along with our associated joint ventures, under exclusive license agreements for a number of states in the southeast, south central, and southwest U.S. as well as the New York City area.  We market cage-free eggs under our trademarked Farmhouse® brand and distribute them across the southeast and southwest regions of the U.S.  We market organic, cage-free, vegetarian, and omega-3 eggs under our 4-GrainÂ® brand. We also produce, market, and distribute private label specialty shell eggs to several customers.
We are a leader in industry consolidation. Since 1989, we have completed twenty acquisitions ranging in size from 600,000 layers to 7.5 million layers.  Despite a market that has been characterized by increasing consolidation, the shell egg production industry remains highly fragmented. At December 31, 2016, 56 producers, owning at least one million layers, owned approximately 97% of total industry layers.  The ten largest producers owned approximately 58% of total industry layers. We believe industry consolidation will continue and we plan to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

This information republished with permission from the American Egg Board.


A hen requires 24 to 26 hours to produce one egg. Thirty minutes later, she starts all over again.
The egg shell may have as many as 17,000 tiny pores over its surface. Through them, the egg can absorb flavors and odors. Storing them in their cartons helps keep them fresh.
Eggs age more in one day at room temperature than in one week in the refrigerator.
About 280 million laying hens produce approximately 6.1 billion dozen eggs per year in the United States.
White shelled eggs are produced by hens with white feathers and ear lobes. Brown shelled eggs are produced by hens with red feathers and red ear lobes.
To tell if an egg is raw or hard-cooked, spin it! If the egg spins easily, it is hard-cooked but if it wobbles, it is raw.




If an egg is accidentally dropped on the floor, sprinkle it heavily with salt for easy clean up.
During the spring (vernal) equinox (about March 21), it is said that an egg will stand on its small end. Although some people have reported success, it is not known whether such results were due to the equinox or to the peculiarities of that particular egg.
Egg yolks are one of the few foods that naturally contain Vitamin D.
Yolk color depends on the diet of the hen. Natural yellow-orange substances such as marigold petals may be added to light-colored feeds to enhance colors. Artificial color additives are not permitted. No hormones are ever given to laying hens.
Occasionally, a hen will produce double-yoked eggs throughout her egg-laying career. It is rare, but not unusual, for a young hen to produce an egg with no yolk at all.

Our History
The success of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. starts with its founder, Fred Adams. Fred’s business interest and ingenuity began at the age of 10 when his father gave him two milk cows and a cotton patch. Fred worked the cotton patch and sold the milk from his cows. In 1957 Adams took the first step to starting an enterprise that has become the largest supplier of eggs in the United States. Purchasing a used truck, he delivered feed in rural areas surrounding Mississippi’s capitol city, Jackson. Later that year, Fred started his first chicken farm on leased property and in 1958 began his first commercial layer operation in Mendenhall, Mississippi.
In 1963, the enterprise expanded to build the world’s largest egg farm in Edwards, Mississippi. During a speaking engagement in Mississippi, national radio commentator Paul Harvey toured the Edwards facilities and was so impressed he dedicated one of his programs to the success of Fred Adams. In 1969 Adams Foods, Incorporated merged with Dairy Fresh Products Company of California and Maine Egg Farms of Lewiston, ME creating Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., supplying eggs from California to Maine.
Since becoming a public company in 1996, Cal-Maine has continued to grow through the acquisition of other egg farms across the country and has maintained its position as the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. In 2014 the Company achieved a milestone by selling over one billion dozen eggs in one year.

Cal-Maine Foods earnings miss expectations
Cal-Maine Foods Inc.  reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $24.5 million, or 51 cents per share, after a loss of $376,000, or 1 cent per share, for the same period last year. The FactSet consensus was for a 22-cent loss. Revenue totaled $274.6 million, down from $303.0 million last year, but ahead of the $269.0 million FactSet consensus. Results included a $5.5 million payment for the BP settlement from the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010. The results "reflect the volatile and challenging egg market fundamentals," said Chief Executive Dolph Baker. Volumes were up due to extra weeks of sales, but the average customer selling price for the quarter was down 15.5% year-over-year. For fiscal 2017, the average customer selling price was down 42% versus 2016. Cal-Maine shares are down 16% for the year so far, while the S&P 500 index  is up 10.4% for the period.

NASDAQ CALM
			










About Cal-Maine Foods
We are the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the United States. In fiscal 2017, we sold approximately 1,031.1 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 20% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock of approximately 36.1 million layers and 9.5 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S.  Layers are mature female chickens, pullets are female chickens usually under 18 weeks of age, and breeders are male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks.
The Company has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs.  The majority of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and non-specialty eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products.  We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage free, organic and brown eggs as specialty products for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as non-specialty products.  While we report separate sales information for these egg types, there are many cost factors which are not specifically available for non-specialty or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers.
We sell most of our shell eggs in the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors and egg product consumers. Some of our sales are completed through co-pack agreements - a common practice in the industry whereby production and processing of certain products is outsourced to another producer.  The strength of our position is evidenced by having the largest market share in the grocery segment for shell eggs.   We sell shell eggs to a majority of large U.S. food retailers.
We are one of the largest producers and marketers of value-added specialty shell eggs in the U.S. They have been a significant and growing segment of the market in recent years.  A significant number of our food service customers, large restaurant chains, and major retailers, including our largest customers, have committed to exclusive offerings of cage-free eggs by specified future dates. We are working with our customers to ensure a smooth transition in meeting their goals. Our focus for future expansion at our farms will be environments that are cage-free or with equipment that can easily be converted to cage-free, based on a timeline to meet our customer's needs.
In fiscal 2017, specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 43.6% and 3.1% of our shell egg sales dollars, respectively, and accounted for approximately 22.9% and 1.6%, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes. In fiscal 2016, specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 29.1% and 2.7% of our shell egg sales dollars, respectively, and accounted for approximately 22.9% and 2.0%, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes.  Prices for specialty eggs are less volatile than non-specialty shell egg prices and are generally higher due to consumer willingness to pay for the perceived increased benefits from those products. We market our specialty shell eggs under the following brands: Egg-Land's Best®, Land O' Lakes®, Farmhouse®, and 4-Grain®.   We are a member of the Egg-Land's Best, Inc. ("EB") cooperative and produce, market and distribute Egg-Land's Best® and Land O' Lakes®  branded eggs, along with our associated joint ventures, under exclusive license agreements for a number of states in the southeast, south central, and southwest U.S. as well as the New York City area.  We market cage-free eggs under our trademarked Farmhouse® brand and distribute them across the southeast and southwest regions of the U.S.  We market organic, cage-free, vegetarian, and omega-3 eggs under our 4-GrainÂ® brand. We also produce, market, and distribute private label specialty shell eggs to several customers.
We are a leader in industry consolidation. Since 1989, we have completed twenty acquisitions ranging in size from 600,000 layers to 7.5 million layers.  Despite a market that has been characterized by increasing consolidation, the shell egg production industry remains highly fragmented. At December 31, 2016, 56 producers, owning at least one million layers, owned approximately 97% of total industry layers.  The ten largest producers owned approximately 58% of total industry layers. We believe industry consolidation will continue and we plan to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

The Focus For Sanderson Farms And Cal-Maine Is On Core Commodity Product Pricing - Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Focus For Sanderson Farms And Cal-Maine Is On Core Commodity Product PricingMay. 4.17 | About: Cal-Maine Foods, (CALM) James Sands Long only, transportation, Growth, portfolio strategyMarketplaceTransports In Focus SummaryIn the recent past, there has been negative rhetoric surrounding stock price fluctuations for Sanderson Farms resulting from expectations for increasing feed costs.Both Sanderson and Cal-Maine are directly exposed to risks associated with the fluctuations of feed costs; but it appears that product pricing has been the core driver of late.Today, both companies have witnessed opposing stock price trends.This has been driven by the inverse relationships of each company's respective core commodity product price trends.

 Source: Google Images Over the past years, a major impediment to stronger stock price performance for chicken producers during certain time periods has resulted from perceived risks of rising feed costs. This has been more strongly pronounced through subjective analysis rhetoric to chicken producers, notably Sanderson Farms. (NASDAQ:SAFM). For Cal-Maine (NASDAQ:CALM), the connection of the dependence on feed costs has been the sole parallel with chicken producers. Aside from this, Cal-Maine's stock price has tended to have an inverse relationship during recent higher feed costs. Similarly, when perceptions have generated concerns for future feed cost increases, Cal-Maine's performance has remained less impacted. Cal-Maine's stock price activity has been driven more by shell egg prices. Sanderson, despite more of a speculative focus on higher feed cost impacts, has also been influenced more so by chicken pricing activities. 


 Source: Yahoo! Finance Since 2010, both Sanderson and Cal-Maine have been closely correlated from a stock price performance perspective. This correlation has been consistently the closest through the summer of 2014. Since then, stock price trends have shifted substantially. But in the past, there have been times where inverse stock price relationships have occurred as well. The best example of this was due to the substantial increase in grain prices during 2011/2012 from droughts. This led to a steep drop in Sanderson's stock price, while Cal-Maine's continued to rise. 

 Since January of 2014, this inverse relationship as it relates to corn prices, has been clear. While corn prices approaching $10 per bushel have consistently wreaked havoc on Sanderson's bottom line and stock price, corn commodity prices have been substantially lower since 2014. There have been spikes here and there, but recent prices have yet to break the $5 per bushel mark. Despite this, Sanderson's stock price reached a low point in the fall of 2015. Part of the sentiment during this time revolved around speculation that grain prices would soon be on the rise. This of course, never has materialized and the stock price is now up over 75 percent from this low point. Cal-Maine on the contrary, witnessed a surge in shell egg prices resulting from Avian Influenza (AI). This occurred during late-Spring in 2015. As a result, Cal-Maine witnessed an increase in its stock price of over 125 percent from early-January at its peak during the fall 2015. At the same time, Sanderson's stock price fell from its summer 2014 high by over 30 percent to its low point. As Sanderson's stock price has rallied by over 75 percent, Cal-Maine's stock price has plummeted by almost 35 percent from the fall 2015 peak. While corn prices (the substantial component of feed costs) have displayed volatility, prices have remained subdued for the most part. Over the past year's high point, prices have actually declined substantially. Clearly, feed costs have not had a substantial impact on performance for Cal-Maine or Sanderson, despite ill-perceived expectations during 2015.
 

 The key driver for stock price activity has been more strongly correlated with core commodity product prices. For Cal-Maine, regional shell egg prices have been highly volatile due to supply issues both from the recent AI outbreak in 2015 and the more recent high inventory levels through 2017. Through late-April 2017, weekly combined regional large shell egg prices were down at -55 percent from last year. The previous two years to 2017, egg shell prices were down at -18 percent and up over 19 percent. This correlation makes much more sense, as many investors already know, the substantial decline in shell prices has had a significant impact on Cal-Maine's net sales and profitability. These impacts have triggered the company's dividend policy into a current no-dividend status. The severity of the company's recent quarterly losses have placed investors in a position where they may not receive any dividends for multiple years once all is said and done. 

 For Sanderson, the story is similar, but somewhat opposite for the current core commodity product pricing cycle. Additionally, Sanderson's operations involve both retail and wholesale customers. As such looking at a couple of pricing trends is of interest. For the company's big bird deboning operations serving foodservice providers among others, chicken parts prices have increased substantially through late-April. Breasts were up 34 percent, leg quarters and tenderloins were up 26 and 25 percent, and whole wings were up six percent. During 2015, all these categories were down at -24, -63, -21 and -5 percent respectively.
 This variation in performance for 2015 and to date illustrate well, the more impactful component of chicken parts pricing to Sanderson's stock price performance during the year. It also serves as a debunker for those who were pushing the feed cost increase rhetoric. 

 *Note: Georgia Dock pricing was discontinued indefinitely after November 2015. The most recent disclosed price from November has been held constant for reference. For whole bird fryer pricing, a similar trend has been apparent leading to the potential for strong performance with Sanderson's retail side of the business. As of late-April, national whole bird fryer prices have increased by 14 percent. Similarly, during 2015, prices had declined by -13 percent, further illustrating the mentioned correlation above. Consumer prices in general have been on the rise for the first quarter of 2017. Gross domestic product (GDP) on the other hand was softer than expected. For the balance of 2017, a return to stronger growth over the next few quarters are still in the cards. As chicken prices have increased strongly, the opportunity for feed cost increases is a reality, but will still be dependent upon the weather and crop yield performance. For Cal-Maine, which is in a completely different commodity cycle, any substantial increase in feed costs would potentially negatively impact the company's operations further. As some investors already know, all commodity prices fluctuate independently of one another based upon supply and demand. Oversupply tends to have multi-year impacts, but over time, the pendulum continues to swing in both directions. Investors should continue to focus on core commodity product pricing trends for both Cal-Maine and Sanderson. Monitoring prices will give us the general sense of supply and demand, but of course, there are many detailed connecting components, which impact pricing.
 At the same time, investors should also continue to monitor feed cost commodity trends. In the case of Sanderson, improved pricing may be able to offset rising feed costs to a degree. For Cal-Maine, any surge in feed costs would be ill-timed as the company is looking to a longer road back to profitability and dividend payments. From an investment management perspective, buying during down cycles is advisable, as these opportunities have historically offered the best returns. Case in point, Cal-Maine is only up 12 percent from January of 2010, due to its recent declines. Longer term, the cycle will reverse its course, offering better stock price appreciation, and eventually, a return of dividend payments. Conversely, Sanderson may be at or approaching a peak pricing point. Over the same 2010 period, the company returned nearly 60 percent. Investors may wish to trim existing positions, and/or wait it out before looking to add or initiate positions.

Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's like we got it from Central Casting: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience. Cue the credits.



Meat & Poultry
If you’re looking for “natural meat,” we’re looking out for you, because that term only means no additives in the finished product. We go further with great-tasting meat from animals raised with no antibiotics, ever, and no added hormones*. Plus, our farmer and rancher partners follow strict standards for farm-animal welfare. And we’ve got you covered when it comes to local, grass-fed and organic, too.



Seafood
Our Seafood Department is the top reason many shoppers give for coming to our stores. Not only will you find a wide selection of fresh and frozen, high-quality seafood, we source only from sustainable fisheries and responsible farms. You can shop with confidence, and our fishmongers are ready with a smile.

Add Share Button To Marquee Box:  Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's the first thing you see when you come into one of our stores: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience.
The quality of produce at our stores is simply second to none. Our produce buyers, based in all regions of the country, maintain relationships with our local growers and our field inspectors are on the road 52 weeks a year seeking out the best of the best.
Organic produce is a mainstay for us. Early on, we committed to offering as much organic produce as available because we believe organic farming supports a healthy environment. Fresh fruits and vegetables grown without the use of long-lasting chemical pesticides and fertilizers will always have a prominent place on our shelves.
We feature local produce in season. While the definition of local varies by region of the country, it generally means one day’s drive away or less, and it's usually much less. Ask a produce team member where your store’s local produce comes from and when your favorite items will be in season.
We know that you like to know where your food comes from, so we display the origin of every piece of produce we sell. To meet customer demand, we do our best to offer the highestquality fruits and vegetables year-round, so we use our experience and relationships with growers from around the world to obtain the best of what's "in season" in other parts of the world.
Devotion to quality and service is a daily mantra in every one of our produce departments. That's why you can find just about anything you want there, from the humble to the exotic, from bananas to Buddha's hand (in season, of course!). Come in and explore. You're bound to find something delicious.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
