RF Industries' Howard Hill: Technology Keeps Changing


	
	
	The Wall Street Transcript (TWST) interviewed Howard F. Hill, President & CEO. He was a co-founder of Celltronics, RF Industries' predecessor company, in 1979. The company went public in 1984 and was in the cellular phone industry. However, they were undercapitalized and could not compete when the industry switched from trunk or automobile mount cellular phones to handhelds. In 1990, they bought a coaxial connector company named RF Industries. Then they completely reorganized, selling off a couple divisions to avoid bankruptcy and renamed the company RF Industries.

Some excerpts from the interview are:
TWST:   Can you tell us something about the products that you are selling?
Mr. Hill:   We have two divisions. The cash cow, the main division, is RF Connector. The sales would be roughly $8 million a year, and they're involved in RF coaxial connectors. We build a wide range of connectors, from large ones up to two inches that fit on towers on top of mountains, to some small ones which fit on the end of a small finger nail which are used inside of different radios and handhelds. Connectors continue to get smaller but the frequencies just get higher and higher. The second division is Neulink, which is a value-added distributor. We buy the basic products from contract manufacturers to meet the customer's needs. These are typically transceivers which are used for wireless data, voice and image distribution in data relay or point to point systems.
TWST:   Will there be improvements in the technology that will work to your advantage as the years go by?
Mr. Hill:   Yes, that's one of the more unique things about electronics. It's almost like a phone book. You come out with a product and it's obsolete right away. So you have a short life span. There are some connectors that have been around since 1939, but most of them keep changing and going to higher frequencies and smaller and smaller sizes. We have been very successful in keeping up with this technology.
TWST:   Can you see within a few years, a major technological jump within wireless?
Mr. Hill: Yes. I think that more and more technology will be going wireless. When we think of wireless today, we just think of the cellular phone, or the new word, which is PCs phones. I think that in the future,
a lot of computers will use wireless local and wide area networks. I also think that a lot of common services will be wireless. Currently, the UPS or the FedEx people have their little handheld units that read the bar-codes to keep track of pick-ups and deliveries. I think you are going to see a tie in of bar coding with wireless, more and more, so that these things will just be scanned and accounted for without human intervention. Many applications where we always had wires running all over the place will become wireless.

Transcripts of interviews like this in the Technology area are available on a for-pay quarterly or annual basis.

Howard F. Kane Plumbing Company - Dallas - Fort Worth - Haltom City - Texas


























































Quality. Integrity. Experience...
Quality. Integrity. Experience. Innovation. These are the intrinsic characteristics you expect when you hire a contractor to complete a complicated commercial design/build project or commercial installation. Howard F. Kane Plumbing Company employs each of them to perpetuate the kind of high-quality product, standards and professional workmanship our company has been known to consistently produce.



Quality
From design to delivery, we help set the standard for the industry by meeting and exceeding expectations. We have more than a half-century of solid experience and reliable performance and we stand behind our work. Our goal is to provide every client with a commitment to quality and excellence by refining processes to improve our products and relationships. We achieve high standards through quality craftsmanship, materials and professional service. Our attitude is quality without compromise.



Integrity
Over the years, our company’s principal focus has been to foster client relationships derived from honesty and integrity. This philosophy, in addition to the attainment of a highly skilled and technically qualified team to serve client needs, has earned Howard F. Kane Plumbing Company a reputation of dedication to work and excellence in product. Our vast experience with a diverse range of methods and materials, and our understanding of building requirements, allows us to lead performance goals throughout our industry.



Experience
With over fifty years in the business, Howard F. Kane Plumbing Company had developed a reputation for unrivaled customer service and the highest quality of work in the region.  Our project experience covers the scope from office buildings and complexes, warehouses and distribution centers, to food processing and medical gas systems. The knowledge and longevity of our project managers and superintendents are unsurpassed in the industry. Our expertise and our resources allow us to practice strict quality control standards and meet rigorous deadlines which reflect our high quality and experience.



Innovation
We specialize in a “team” approach to project delivery because it consistently offers the owner and contractor the most value for their investment. Partnering with architects, developers and owners, our projects are constructed to maximize cost-efficiency, versatility and endurance through the use of a method called value-engineering. The value-engineering analysis compares the initial cost versus long term return on investment and often results in design changes and/or selection of critical materials and methods of construction. As a direct team associate, you are kept informed as to the available options and receive objective recommendations. Not only are communications better from the inception of the project but this process offers other advantages down the line in terms of schedule and quality control.
