University Governance and Organization
Stanford University is a trust with corporate powers under the laws of the State of California. The university is a tax-exempt entity under section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the provisions of the Founding Grant, the Board of Trustees (with a maximum membership of 38) is custodian of the endowment and all the properties of Stanford University. The board administers the invested funds, sets the annual budget and determines policies for operation and control of the university. Among the powers given to the trustees by the Founding Grant is the power to appoint a president. The board delegates broad authority to the president to operate the university and to the faculty on certain academic matters. The formal legal name is “The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University.”
Stanford Health Care, previously known as Stanford Hospital & Clinics, and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, are nonprofit California corporations. They are separate from the university and from one another. 
Accreditation
Stanford University is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of
            Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools
            and Colleges.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

				BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY 
				
					v
				
				. ROCHE MOLECULAR
				
				SYSTEMS, INC., et al.
			

				certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
			


				No. 09–1159. Argued February 28, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011
			


				In 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.  A Nobel Prize winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral part of these efforts. 
			

				


				    
				
				    
				In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford University’s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs.  Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time.  When he did so, he signed an agreement stating that he “agree[d] to assign” to Stanford his “right, title and interest in” inventions resulting from his employment there.  Holodniy’s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus to learn about PCR.  As a condition of gaining access to Cetus, Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he “will assign and do[es] hereby assign” to Cetus his “right, title and interest in … the ideas, inventions, and improvements” made “as a consequence of [his] access” to Cetus.  Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount of HIV in a patient’s blood.  Upon returning to Stanford, he and other Stanford employees tested the procedure.  Stanford secured three patents to the measurement process.
			

				


				    
				
				    
				Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus’s PCR-related assets.  After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure.  Today, its HIV test kits are used worldwide.
			

				


				    
				
				    
				The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded “subject invention[s]” between the Federal Government and federal contractors.  

 35 U. S. C. §§201(e), (c), 202(a).  The Act defines “subject invention” as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,” §201(e), and provides that contractors may “elect to retain title to any subject invention,” §202(a).  Because some of Stanford’s research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied.  In accordance with the Act’s requirements, Stanford notified NIH that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on the Government a license to use the patented procedure. 
			

				


				    
				
				    
				Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits infringed Stanford’s patents.  Roche responded that Holodniy’s agreement with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement.  Stanford countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the University had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act.  The District Court agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holodniy had no rights to assign to Cetus.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniy’s agreement with Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche.  It also found that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventor’s rights in federally funded inventions.  Thus, the Act did not extinguish Roche’s ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was deprived of standing. 
			


					Held: 
				
				The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions.  Pp. 6–15.
			

				
				    
				(a) Since 1790, patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.  See, 
				
					e.g.,
				

					Gayler 
				
				v. 
				
					Wilder,
				
				 10 How. 477, 493.  In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor, or—because an inventor’s interest in his invention is assignable in law by an instrument in writing—an inventor’s assignee.  See 
				
					United States
				
				 v. 
				
					Dubilier Condenser Corp.
				
				, 

289 U. S. 178
.  Absent an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not have rights in an invention “which is the original conception of the employee alone,” 
				
					id., 
				
				at 189; an inventor must expressly grant those rights to his employer, see 
				
					id.
				
				, at 187.  Pp. 6–8.
			

				


				    
				(b) Stanford and 
				
					amicus 
				
				United States contend that, when an invention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal funds, the Bayh-Dole Act vests title to those inventions in the inventor’s employer—the federal contractor.  Congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified federal contracts become the Government’s property.  Such unambiguous language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole Act.  Instead, the Act provides that contractors may “elect to retain title to any subject invention,” §202(a), defining a “subject invention” as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,” §201(e). 
			

				


				    
				Stanford contends that “invention of the contractor” means all inventions that a contractor’s employees make with the aid of federal funds.  That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.  This Court has rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee’s invention in the employer. Stanford’s reading also renders the phrase “of the contractor” superfluous since the definition already covers inventions made under a funding agreement.  Construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement—inventions “of the contractor,” that is, those owned by or belonging to the contractor—makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.  And “invention owned by the contractor” or “invention belonging to the contractor” are natural readings of the phrase “invention of the contractor.” 
			

				


				    
				Section 202(a), which states that contractors may “elect to retain title,” confirms that the Act does not 
				
					vest 
				
				title.  Stanford reaches the opposite conclusion, but only because it reads “retain” to mean “acquire” and “receive.”  That is certainly not the common meaning of “retain,” which is “to hold or continue to hold in possession or use.”  You cannot retain something unless you already have it.  And §210(a)—which provides that the Act “take[s] precedence over any other Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions … that is inconsistent with” the Act—does not displace the basic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention.  Only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into play.  The Act’s disposition of rights does nothing more than clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor. 
			

				


				    
				The Act’s isolated provisions dealing with inventors’ rights in subject inventions are consistent with the Court’s construction of the Act.  See §202(d).  That construction is also bolstered by the Act’s limited procedural protections, which expressly give contractors the right to challenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject invention, §202(b)(4), but do not provide similar protection for inventor and third-party rights. 
			

				


				    
				Stanford’s contrary construction would permit title to an employee’s inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the invention’s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding.  It also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar of federal funding applied toward an invention’s conception or reduction to practice.  It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions.  To do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising.  Had Congress intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearly—not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of “subject invention” and an idiosyncratic use of the word “retain.” 
			

				


				    
				The Court’s construction of the Act is also reflected in the common practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments.  With effective assignments, federally funded inventions become “subject inventions” and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says it should.  The only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own their inventions.  Pp. 8–15.
			

				583 F. 3d 832, affirmed.

Holding: The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions.Plain English Holding: The right to patent an invention ordinarily belongs to the person who created the invention, rather than to the inventorâ€™s employer (unless the employer and employee agree otherwise).  That rule does not change simply because the invention was created with the assistance of federal funding.
Judgment: Affirmed on June 6, 2011. Justice Sotomayor joined the Courtâ€™s opinion but also filed a concurring opinion; Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Ginsburg.

Term Snapshot 

This Week at the Court The court is now on its summer recess. The justices will meet next for their September 25 conference.

Recent Decisions Davila v. DavisThe ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel does not provide cause to excuse the procedural default of ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims.California Public Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.The public pension fund's untimely filing of its individual complaint under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 more than three years after the relevant securities offering is ground for dismissal under Section 13 of the act.Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. ComerThe Missouri Department of Natural Resources' express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect or other religious entity violated the rights of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc., under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment by denying the church an otherwise available public benefit on account of its religious status.Hernández v. Mesa(1) A Bivens remedy is not available when there are "special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress," and the court recently clarified in Ziglar v. Abbasi what constitutes a special factor counselling hesitation; the court of appeals should consider how the reasoning and analysis in Ziglar bear on the question whether the parents of a victim shot by a U.S. Border Patrol agent may recover damages for his death; (2) It would be imprudent for the Supreme Court to decide Jesus Hernandez’s Fourth Amendment claim when, in light of the intervening guidance provided in Abbasi, doing so may be unnecessary to resolve this particular case; and (3) with respect to Hernandez’s Fifth Amendment claim, because it is undisputed that the victim's nationality and the extent of his ties to the United States were unknown to the agent at the time of the shooting, the en banc court of appeals erred in granting qualified immunity based on those facts.see all this Term’s cases »

FOUNDING AND GOVERNANCE: How was the University founded and how is it governed today?
The Leland Stanford Junior University was founded by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford on November 11, 1885 in memory of their only child. The Founding Grant empowered The Board of Trustees to govern the University in accordance with the purposes and requirements set forth in the document. The activities that take place at Stanford or on behalf of Stanford are to be in keeping with the terms of the Founding Grant or its amendments.
Under the provisions of the Founding Grant, the Board of Trustees (with a maximum membership of 38) is the custodian of the endowment and all the properties of Stanford University. The Board administers the invested fund, sets the annual budget, and determines policies for the operation and control of the University. Among the powers given to the Trustees is the power to appoint a President, who is responsible for the management of the University and all of its departments.
For a comprehensive description of the founding of the University and its governance please see Administrative Guide Memo 11 at http://adminguide.stanford.edu/11.pdf.

STANFORD’S MOTION TO CONFIRM/AMEND PICS
CASE NO. C 05 04158 MHP

Case3:05-cv-04158-MHP Document215 Filed12/26/07 Page2 of 9

TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:
Please take notice that on February 4, 2008, at 2:00 p.m., in Courtroom 15 of the 

above entitled court, located at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, Plaintiff 

and Counterclaim Defendant The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University 

(“Stanford”) will and hereby does move the Court for an order confirming and granting leave 

to amend Stanford’s Infringement Contentions. 

This motion is based on the instant Notice of Motion, Motion, Memorandum of 

Points and Authorities in support thereof, and all records and papers on file in this action and 

any evidence or oral argument offered at any hearing on this motion. Stanford respectfully 

moves this Court for an order confirming and granting leave to amend Stanford’s 

Infringement Contentions to address Roche’s COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test as an accused 

product. 

I.

INTRODUCTION
Stanford hereby moves to confirm and/or amend its Preliminary Infringement 

Contentions with respect to Roche’s COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test (“TaqMan”) product. 

Roche initially agreed to produce documents relating to its TaqMan product, and has sought 

the Court’s extensive consideration of the claim construction issue related exclusively to 

TaqMan. Although Stanford served Roche with amended infringement contentions 

identifying TaqMan as an accused product almost six months ago, Roche has refused to 

provide any document discovery regarding TaqMan because Stanford did not file a formal 

motion to amend. Most recently, Roche has refused to prepare its Rule 30(b)(6) witness on 

any categories relating to TaqMan. Roche’s duplicity has caused Stanford substantial 

prejudice, and even the Court’s specific consideration of TaqMan issues in claim 

construction has not ended Roche’s discovery abuse. Accordingly, Stanford requests that the 

Court confirm TaqMan is part of the case and/or grant Stanford leave to amend.

II.

THE COURT SHOULD GRANT LEAVE TO AMEND
A.
On April 13, 2007, Stanford served Preliminary Infringement Contentions as required 

Factual Background

by the Court’s Case Management Order for the infringement phase of this case. (Declaration 

of Anthony J. Patek in Support of Stanford’s Motion to Confirm and Amend Its Infringement 

Contentions (“Patek Decl.”), Exs. 1 & 2.) Stanford’s April 13, 2007, Preliminary 

Infringement Contentions identified two Roche products, the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test 

and the COBAS Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test. (Id., Ex. 1.) At the time, these products 

were the only FDA-approved quantitative PCR HIV-1 tests marketed by Roche. 

On May 14, 2007, Roche announced that the FDA had approved Roche’s TaqMan 

assay for distribution in the United States. (Patek Decl., Ex. 3 at STAN 031805.) Roche’s 

TaqMan product uses real-time PCR to quantitate HIV-1 RNA for monitoring the 

effectiveness of therapy. (Id. at STAN 31806.) Although documents related to TaqMan 

were responsive to Stanford’s existing document requests that covered “[Roche] products 

used to monitor the clinical progression of HIV infection and its response to antiretroviral 

therapy through the use of PCR,” Roche did not notify Stanford of the release of the product. 

(Patek Decl., Ex. 18.) Indeed, Roche had provided no discovery whatsoever with regard to 

TaqMan.

On May 20, 2007, Stanford explicitly requested discovery relating to TaqMan. 

(Patek Decl., Ex. 4.) In response, Roche stated: “With respect to Roche’s document 

production, we believe that Stanford already has much of what it seeks, including 

development documents and FDA submission 
the accused kits. 
Nevertheless, we are in the process of gathering additional documents and will specifically 
search for the categories of documents identified in your letter.” (Patek Decl., Ex. 5 

information for 

(emphasis added).)

After learning of the FDA approval of TaqMan on its own, on May 31, 2007, 

Stanford reiterated its request for TaqMan-related documents. (Patek Decl., Exs. 6 & 2.)

that it would withhold documents related to TaqMan, stating, “Roche is searching for 

additional relevant documents and will be producing additional documents on a rolling 

basis.” (Patek Decl., Ex. 7.)

Contrary to its representations, Roche produced no documents related to TaqMan. 

Stanford conducted its own investigation, and on July 10, 2007, Stanford served an amended 

set of infringement contentions that specifically identified TaqMan as an accused device. 

(Patek Decl., Ex. 8.) Although Stanford served the amended contentions without leave of 

Court, Roche did not object to Stanford’s service of amended infringement contentions 

identifying TaqMan as an accused product.

On August 29, 2007, months after Roche agreed to produce TaqMan documents, 

Roche took the position in a footnote of its Responsive Claim Construction Brief that 

TaqMan “real time kits are not accused products,” because “Stanford has not sought leave to 

amend its infringement contentions.” (Patek Decl., Ex. 13 at 14 n.5.) Since then, Roche has 

refused to provide any discovery relating to TaqMan.

Stanford nonetheless continued to pursue discovery related to TaqMan from Roche. 

On August 31, 2007, Stanford again requested TaqMan documents covered by its prior 

requests. (Patek Decl., Ex. 9.) Also on August 31, 2007, Stanford served Roche with 

document requests that explicitly identified TaqMan as an accused product. (Patek Decl., 

Ex. 10.) In attached correspondence, Stanford reiterated that “[a]lthough the TaqMan 

product is clearly covered by our previous definition of Accused Products, we have amended 

the definition to avoid any ambiguity on this point.” (Patek Decl., Ex. 9.) Stanford included 

additional requests for TaqMan related material in correspondence on November 9 and 

November 27, 2007. (Patek Decl., Exs. 11-12.)

B.

Stanford Was Diligent Despite Roche’s Failure to Comply with its Discovery 
Obligations

Stanford’s July 10 amended contentions clearly meet the good cause requirement. 

The Court may grant a party the right to amend its infringement contentions upon a showing 

of “good cause.” Patent L.R. 3-7. A movant may establish good cause by a showing of

diligence and lack of prejudice to the non-movant. O2 Micro Int’l Ltd. v. Monolithic Power 

Sys., Inc., 467 F.3d 1355, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Other factors relevant to the “good cause” 

inquiry are notice, effect on case schedule, the non-movant’s access to relevant knowledge, 

and whether the issues raised by the amendment were addressed during claim construction.1 

Here, although the TaqMan product was being sold in Europe, it was reasonable for Stanford 

to wait until the product’s release in the United States before naming it as an accused 

infringing product. For example, products being used solely to gain their FDA approval may 

have protection from infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e). As soon as TaqMan was 

released, Stanford moved quickly to evaluate it and subsequently add it to its infringement 

contentions.

Within a week of the FDA approval of TaqMan for distribution in the United States, 

Stanford requested a sample of TaqMan from Roche for inspection. (Patek Decl., Ex. 4.) 

Shortly thereafter, Stanford specifically 

informed Roche 

that discovery requests 

encompassed TaqMan as an accused product. (Patek Decl, Ex. 6.) Then, despite Roche’s 

failure to comply with its discovery obligations, Stanford conducted an independent 

investigation and served amended infringement contentions identifying TaqMan as an 

accused instrumentality. (Patek Decl., Ex. 8.) In sum, Stanford “put all [its] cards on the 

table up front” and thus has good cause for the amendment. Integrated Circuit Sys., Inc. v. 

Realtek Semiconductor Co., 308 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1107 (N.D. Cal. 2004).

Further, by its conduct, Roche has waived any right to claim prejudice. Roche has 

“long been on notice” that Stanford accused TaqMan. IXYS Corp., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 1152 

n.19. If Roche objected to providing TaqMan discovery, the time to do so was in response to 

Stanford’s letters in May. Instead, Roche not only failed to claim any prejudice at that time,

CASE NO. C-05-04158 MHP

Case3:05-cv-04158-MHP Document215 Filed12/26/07 Page6 of 9

it actually agreed twice to search for documents, leading Stanford to believe that Roche was 

not contesting discovery related to TaqMan.2 Thus, any delay in serving the amended 

infringement contentions was caused by Roche’s own discovery abuse and gamesmanship. 

As to the fact that Stanford did not seek leave to amend when it served the July 2007 

contentions, Roche’s failure timely to object, coupled with its apparent agreement to provide 

TaqMan discovery, led Stanford reasonably to believe that TaqMan had been placed at issue 

in the case. Roche’s subsequent objection in its claim construction brief was plainly 

calculated to maximize the prejudice to Stanford, after having lulled Stanford into believing 

TaqMan was already at issue. Stanford thus respectfully submits that, as in IXYS Corp., 

granting leave to amend “will privilege substance over form.” 321 F. Supp. 2d at 1152 n.19.

C.

The Claim Construction Proceeding and This Court’s Ruling Have 
Already Addressed TaqMan

Although Roche reneged on its agreement to produce TaqMan materials in its 

Responsive Claim Construction Brief, that brief nonetheless treated TaqMan as part of the 

case. Only the TaqMan product uses real time PCR, which was a prominent part of Roche’s 

claim construction efforts. Roche devoted about two pages of its Responsive Claim 

Construction Brief and part of one supporting expert declaration to real time PCR. (Patek 

Decl., Ex. 13; id., Ex. 14.) During the claim construction tutorial and hearing, Roche 

discussed real time PCR at length. (Patek Decl., Ex. 15 at 73:2-80:5; 85:13-88:9.) Roche 

even requested additional briefing related solely to construction of claim terms with respect 

to real time PCR. (Id. at 85:13-24; 88:3-9.) Roche subsequently submitted two additional 

expert declarations dedicated solely to the issue of real time PCR and construction of the 

“about 30 cycles” limitation of the patents. (Patek Decl., Exs. 16 & 17.) The Court’s claim 

construction ruling expressly addresses the real time issue that Roche raised, and that relates 

solely to TaqMan.3





2 (Patek Decl, Exs. 5 & 7.) Compare Fresnius Med. Care, 2006 WL 1329997, at *7 (delay in 
moving to amend excused where opposing party failed to object and move to strike), with O2 
Micro Int’l, 467 F.3d at 1364 (delay in moving to amend unjustified where opposing party 
clearly objects to amended contentions).

CASE NO. C-05-04158 MHP

Case3:05-cv-04158-MHP Document215 Filed12/26/07 Page7 of 9

Given its extensive briefing on this topic, Roche cannot now argue that TaqMan is 

not already included in this case or that Roche would be prejudiced by granting Stanford 

leave to accuse TaqMan of infringement. Fresenius Med. Care, 2006 WL 1329997, at *7. 

Further, Roche’s decision to raise this procedural issue first and solely in a footnote in the 

claim construction briefing made it reasonable for Stanford to await the Court’s claim 

construction decision and address any amendment issues at the same time. At Roche’s 

insistence, this Court ruled on the real time issue presented by TaqMan, which should have 

prompted Roche to provide full discovery regarding TaqMan. TaqMan is plainly part of this 

case and Roche should be deemed to have waived its arguments to the contrary.

Roche Should Not Be Permitted to Benefit from its Discovery Abuse

D.
In the six months since Stanford specifically requested TaqMan discovery and Roche 

agreed to provide it, Roche never claimed any prejudice from the addition of TaqMan to the 

case. Only as recently as December 14, 2007 did Roche claim for the first time that it would 

be prejudiced by having to provide TaqMan discovery, acknowledging that it has refused to 

search for TaqMan-related documents and that did not intend to prepare its Rule 30(b)(6) 

witnesses on TaqMan topics. This alleged prejudice is of Roche’s own making. Roche’s 

refusal to comply with the Federal Rules cannot be twisted into a basis for prejudice. 

To the contrary, Roche’s discovery abuses have substantially prejudiced Stanford. It 

is unfair for Roche to agree to provide discovery, retract that agreement, and then claim that 

its own discovery failure results in prejudice. Fresenius Med. Care, 2006 WL 1329997, at 

*7 (where amended contentions and discovery were served without leave, finding that 

opposing party’s delay in moving to strike supported later motion for leave to amend). 

Furthermore, since discovery is not limited by the identification of accused devices, any 

failure on Roche’s part to gather and prepare TaqMan materials is the product of its own 

discovery misconduct. LG Electronics Inc v. Q-Lity Computer Inc., 211 F.R.D. 360 (N.D. 





PCR, as well as its construction of the terms “about 30 cycles” and “PCR.” The Court 
specifically excluded the term “about 30 cycles” from briefing, and the term “PCR” had never 
been identified as a term requiring construction.

Cal. 2002) (refusing to limit scope of discovery to products identified under Patent L.R. 3-

1(b)). Roche should not be rewarded for its refusal to comply with its discovery obligations. 

E.

Requiring a New Case to be Filed for TaqMan Would Waste Judicial and 
Party Resources

Amendment to formally include TaqMan is also supported by considerations of 

efficiency and resources. If TaqMan is not part of the case, Stanford’s only choice is to bring 

another separate case focused on TaqMan. That would plainly be a waste of the parties’ and 

this Court’s resources. Monohan v. New York Dep’t of Corrections, 214 F.3d 275, 284 (2d 

Cir. 2000) (citing Block v. First Blood Ass’n, 988 F.2d 344, 350 (2d Cir. 1993) (considering 

ability of plaintiff to raise second claim in new lawsuit in weighing prejudice associated with 

amending complaint).

III.

STANFORD’S REVISIONS TO ITS L.R. 3-1(C) AND (D) CHART BASED ON THE COURT’S 
ORDER ARE A MATTER OF RIGHT UNDER THE LOCAL RULES
Under Patent L.R. 3-6, “[i]f a party claiming patent infringement believes in good 

faith that (1) the Court’s Claim Construction Ruling . . . so requires, not later than 30 days 

after service by the Court of its Claim Construction Ruling, that party may serve ‘Final 

Infringement Contentions’ without leave of the court that amend its ‘Preliminary 

Infringement Contentions’ with respect to the information required by Patent L.R. 3-1(c) and 

(d).” Stanford had asserted literal infringement by TaqMan in its preliminary contentions. 

This Court’s claim construction ruling precludes literal infringement by TaqMan. Thus, 

Stanford’s amended contentions are revised to reflect the Court’s construction and the 

infringement by Taqman under the doctrine of equivalents in light of that construction. 

These amended contentions were served on December 21, 2007, and thus within the required 

30 days. (Patek Decl., Ex. 19.)
