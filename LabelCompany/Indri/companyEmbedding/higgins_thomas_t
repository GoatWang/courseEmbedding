From the outset, we have used the latest software and hardware technology to deliver our high quality service.
                        We recently worked with Hewlett-Packard to upgrade our storage area network giving us a faster platform and longer disk life.

                    Free Debt Collection
                
                


                    There is a quiet revolution happening in the recovery of legal costs where it is necessary to take court action against a debtor. Due to a small change in regulations, the 
                    debtor is now liable to pay all costs of default proceedings. What this means for you is 100% free debt collection on successful recovery with Thomas Higgins Limited.

                



                        Under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 you are entitled to claim back the costs involved with recovering your debts. Our Late Payment Demand letter
                        not only instructs the debtor to pay the debt owed within 7 days, but enables you to recover the costs of using our services at various stages of the collection process.
                        Therefore by choosing Thomas Higgins Limited for your debt recovery, there is no need for you to be out of pocket for chasing money that should be yours anyway.
                        With a successful claim, not only are our costs covered, but as we don't charge commission or a percentage, you will receive all of what is retrieved from the debtor and at no
                        extra cost.

                    


                        Wait! That’s not all. By sending one of our Late Payment Demands to your debtor you are also able to claim compensation and additional interest on each of your outstanding invoices.
                        You are entitled to claim £40 to £100 in compensation per invoice and interest at 8% above the Bank of England's base rate, all in addition to the original debt amount
                        and legal costs. With Thomas Higgins Limited acting on your behalf, not only can debt collection be free, but you can actual recovery much more than the original debt
                        amount, which should help go towards easing the strain of invoices being paid late or not being paid at all.

                    





                    
                    Missed Out On Compensation?
 
                


                    Did you know that even if an invoice has been fully paid, you may still be entitled to claim compensation and additional interest? If payment was received after the due date of an
                    invoice then you could still claim £40 to £100 compensation per invoice. By issuing one of our Late Payment Demands we could recover money that you
                    didn’t even know you were owed.

                



                        We recommend that you review your old invoices and see which ones were paid late. Your invoices may have been paid in full, but did you claim compensation for late payment?
                        Under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 you are entitled to claim compensation and interest at 8% above the Bank of England's base rate on each of your
                        late paid invoices. If you're concerned about the costs of claiming compensation, you need not worry, because if you issue a Late Payment Demand through Thomas Higgins Limited
                        then you can also recovery the legal costs involved, meaning that you can claim compensation and additional interest for free if your claim is successful.

                        complicated forms, and key information is presented to help you at

                    Debt recovery is an important part of running a business as it can seriously affect your cashflow when customers and clients refuse to pay. 
                    Recovering business debts can be time consuming and costly so having someone you can rely on to arrange your business debt recovery 
                    quickly and easily is a vital consideration.

                



                        There is a commitment to quality and efficiency in all our business debt collection services and we aim to be the most cost-effective and

                    collection solicitors, but our exceptionally high rate of client satisfaction is a result of several factors including the quality 
                    of our customer service, the speed and efficiency with which we operate and of course our excellent value for money.

                    Experienced Solicitors
                        
                


                    We are a team of debt collection solicitors with years of experience in the field of business debt recovery. Since 1980 
                    we have provided a fast, efficient and cost effective way for businesses to recover their debt and have established an excellent reputation 
                    within the debt collection industry, making us a valued asset to many businesses.
                                
                



                        As the UK's leading independent law firm for commercial debt recovery we are well known for our outstanding customer 
                        service and our excellent success rate, making us a market leader in business to business debt collection and well respected within the
                        law community.

                    


                        We specialize in debt recovery for businesses across all sectors. We act for London Stock Exchange quoted companies,
                        subsidiaries of companies quoted on the American and French Stock Exchange and over 130 PLCs. We also work for medium and small businesses,
                        partnerships and sole traders. If you would like us to act on your behalf then
                        open an account
                        with us. There are no setup charges or
                        initial costs and you could start your debt recovery immediately for as little as £3.00 (plus VAT). 

                    





                        
                    Cost Effective Debt Collection
                        
                


                    As specialised debt collection solicitors we are able to make the debt recovery process simpler and therefore have
                    been able to reduce the costs involved. Unlike many debt collection agencies we do not charge commission or a percentage of any debt
                    we recover. We have made
                    our costs
                    as transparent as possible so you are not faced with any unexpected charges or hidden extras.   
                                
                



                        We are proud that we have made the debt collection process as simple and as quick as possible by offering all our clients free unlimited access
                        to our custom designed
                        online services
                        which enables clients to issue instructions and track the progress of cases throughout the recovery process.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
