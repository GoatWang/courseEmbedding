Overview



An Inkling of Brewster details a decade long foray into custom built automobiles by Brewster and Company of Long Island City, New York beginning in 1915. Brewster and Company was the foremost custom coachbuilder of 19th Century America. Founded in 1810, Brewster and Company began building bodies for European chassis such as Rolls Royce, Delaunay-Belleville, Fiat, and Renault in 1905. The advent of World War I and the interdiction of shipping by German U-boats on the high seas made it impossible for Brewster and Company to secure chassis from the continent, so they produced the most expensive automobile of the day bearing their name. An Inkling of Brewster examines not only the Brewster automobile, but also the wealthy who purchased them. A Brewster owner’s list reads like a “Who’s Who” of New York Society.  	The Rev. Frank E. Wismer III is the owner of a 1921 Brewster Double Enclosed Drive automobile that originally belonged to Mrs. H. D. Auchincloss of Hammersmith Farm, Newport Rhode Island. He has been researching Brewster and Company for the past two years and has been fortunate enough to study the Brewster and Company journals along with the correspondence of Mr. William Brewster.  	CH (COL) Wismer is a retired United States Army Chaplain having served in the First Gulf War, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq and Kuwait. He is the author of War in the Garden of Eden: A Chaplain’s Memoir from Baghdad. He is also the author of two meditation guides published by the Episcopal Cursillo Movement.

Overview



The Korean War—or, “conflict,” as it’s known by only those who weren’t on the battlefield—was a devastating time in world history. Although most of modern American society has forgotten just how devastating the toll was, those in the upper echelons of power are particularly aware of the uneasy truce that has existed since the ceasefire. A truce so precarious, that the slightest misstep may send the two countries back into the crosshairs of a multi-national war. Meanwhile, Jessica DeLucca is a seemingly normal teenager. A drummer in a surprisingly successful band, Jess is reveling in the success of her music while simultaneously navigating interfamilial drama. During her band’s gig at the Navajo Nation Fair, a mysterious woman gives her an even more mysterious necklace. This otherwise ordinary trinket may hold the key to world peace; that is, if Jess can steer clear of the bloodthirsty agents who seek to wield this power for less peaceable outcomes.

Overview



A behind-the-scenes look at life in Baghdad, Iraq, during the months following the invasion in 2003. Wismer, a recently retired Army colonel and chaplain, has spent many years in the Middle East, beginning with Operation Desert Storm. His memoir not only reveals the daily drama of war, it also raises salient questions about U.S. strategy regarding the "war on terror."This book also looks at the dynamic interaction of major faith groups within Iraq, and the religious heritage of the "cradle of civilization" as applied to the strategic implication of global terrorism. The author's views are insightfully recorded and influenced by his many calls to duty, which have also taken him to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kuwait.More than a first-hand account of military life during the turbulent period immediately after the assault by coalition forces, War in the Garden of Eden also explores the inner workings of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) from a soldier's perspective, the daily life of personnel assigned to the CPA, and some of the many decisions made, under constant life-threatening situations, to establish peace and stability in the country during the ground war.
