Abdiel Capital | About

 What Abdiel does
Abdiel generally invests in publicly traded companies that are likely to gain market share over long time periods. We prefer businesses that have recurring revenue and that are managed by people with a large share of their net worth in the stock. Our ten largest investments frequently comprise more than 75% of invested capital. We started in 2006.
 



What we want for our investors
Returns that are good on an absolute basis and that outperform the market, measured over 3-5 years.
How we value companies
We estimate the return a company’s cash flows would deliver to someone who bought the entire business at the available stock price and held it permanently.
What we look for “under the hood” of companies
The same thing we look for in our own. Leaders who care viscerally about the quality of the products they sell. A corporate culture in which people thrive. Coincidence or not, in our experience we make more money with companies we admire than with those we don’t.

What we want for the people who work at Abdiel
We look for unusually smart people for whom research is fun. We want to alter their trajectories, so that they live bigger lives than if they had gone to work somewhere else.
What we want Abdiel to add to the world
Work done well and with pleasure. The craftsman is a better person for his efforts, and so is anyone who notices. Moreover, good investment analysis helps companies raise the world’s standard of living. Enterprises work best when they have access to capital priced to reflect the value they can create. Index funds, by the way, do not price capital; they only mimic the actions of those who do.

Abdiel Capital | About










































 











 
 











Select Page


  
 



 





 
 
 












 



 What Abdiel does
Abdiel generally invests in publicly traded companies that are likely to gain market share over long time periods. We prefer businesses that have recurring revenue and that are managed by people with a large share of their net worth in the stock. Our ten largest investments frequently comprise more than 75% of invested capital. We started in 2006.
 



What we want for our investors
Returns that are good on an absolute basis and that outperform the market, measured over 3-5 years.
How we value companies
We estimate the return a company’s cash flows would deliver to someone who bought the entire business at the available stock price and held it permanently.
What we look for “under the hood” of companies
The same thing we look for in our own. Leaders who care viscerally about the quality of the products they sell. A corporate culture in which people thrive. Coincidence or not, in our experience we make more money with companies we admire than with those we don’t.

What we want for the people who work at Abdiel
We look for unusually smart people for whom research is fun. We want to alter their trajectories, so that they live bigger lives than if they had gone to work somewhere else.
What we want Abdiel to add to the world
Work done well and with pleasure. The craftsman is a better person for his efforts, and so is anyone who notices. Moreover, good investment analysis helps companies raise the world’s standard of living. Enterprises work best when they have access to capital priced to reflect the value they can create. Index funds, by the way, do not price capital; they only mimic the actions of those who do.

 Educational Background



AB in Economics, magna cum laude

                  Harvard was established in 1636, and it is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. The University, which is based in Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts, has an enrollment of over 20,000 degree candidates, including undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

 Career History



Analyst

                                    Current                


Abdiel Capital Advisors LP


                  Abdiel Capital Advisors seeks over a three- to five-year time horizon to deliver attractive absolute returns and to outperform the U.S. equity markets while minimizing the likelihood of permanent impairment of the funds’ capital. The preferred method for doing is to invest capital for the long-term in a concentrated portfolio of good businesses. The portfolio typically comprises 10 to 20 common stocks issued in global, developed-market countries. Abdiel Capital may have other investments but they will usually remain a relatively small percentage of the portfolio. The firm does not restrict itself to particular geographies, industries, or asset classes. On occasion, the firm may make investments other than in equity securities and other than in good businesses held for the long-term. Abdiel Capital's propensity to do so will depend on the attractiveness of specific opportunities in other asset classes. Examples of such asset classes include options, fixed income securities, and special situations such as merger arbitrage, spinoffs, recapitalizations, and liquidations. They may also sell securities short.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
