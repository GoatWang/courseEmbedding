Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

Section
1.1 The
Company
 
Magnitude
Information Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a Delaware
corporation on April 19, 1988 under the name Fortunistics, Inc. On November 18,
1998, the Company changed its name to Magnitude Information Systems, Inc. The
Company owns substantially all outstanding stock of Magnitude, Inc., an
operating subsidiary. The 1% of Magnitude, Inc. not owned by the Company
constitutes a minority interest which is valued at $0.

On August
16, 2007 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Kiwibox Media,
Inc.

The
Company, Magnitude, Inc. and Kiwibox Media Inc. are separate legal entities,
with Kiwibox Media, Inc. being a wholly owned subsidiary. The operations of the
combined entity are currently comprised almost exclusively of the operations of
Kiwibox Media, Inc. 

Prior to
the implementation of its strategic business plan in 2007, the Company’s primary
product was an integrated suite of proprietary software modules previously
marketed under the name ErgoEnterprise™. During the latter half of fiscal
year 2006, Company management concluded that the marketplace for the Company’s
ergonomic software products was not developing, and would not develop to the
material extent necessary in the next 12 to 24 months, to support and sustain
the Company’s sales efforts. Accordingly, management determined that it would be
in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to identify another
business opportunity and pursue it for the benefit of our shareholders. On
February 19, 2007, the Company, pursuant to its strategic plan to seek another
business opportunity, signed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with the
owners of a social networking website, to acquire their Kiwibox.com website and
business, represented by Kiwibox Media, Inc. Pursuant to that certain Agreement
and Plan of Reorganization, in August, 2007, Kiwibox Media, Inc. merged with and
into Magnitude Operations, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Magnitude
Information Systems, Inc., in a “reverse merger” transaction. The three
shareholders of Kiwibox Media, Inc. transferred and delivered all of the
outstanding stock of Kiwibox Media, Inc. to Magnitude Operations, Inc. for
cancellation and
received in exchange shares of Magnitude Information Systems, Inc. at closing.
Also at closing and as a result of the merger, the separate legal existence of
Magnitude Operations, Inc. ceased and Kiwibox Media, Inc. became the surviving
corporation of the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Magnitude Information
Systems, Inc. Following the merger, Magnitude Information Systems, Inc. is
planning to change its corporate name to “KiwiAge Enterprises, Inc.”

The
Company is currently subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company has the authority to issue an
aggregate of Seven Hundred Million (700,000,000) Common Shares, par value
$.0001, and Three Million (3,000,000) Preferred Shares, par value $.001, of
which at December 31, 2007, Two Thousand Five Hundred (2,500) were designated as
Cumulative Preferred Shares, par value $.001; Three Hundred Thousand (300,000)
were designated as Series A Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$0.001; Three Hundred Fifty Thousand (350,000) were designated as Series B
Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001; One Hundred Twenty
Thousand (120,000) were designated as Series C Senior Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $0.001; Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) were designated as
Series D Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001; Five Hundred
Thousand (500,000) were designated as Series E Senior Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $0.001, and Forty-Three Thousand Six Hundred Ten (43,610) were
designated Series G Senior Convertible Preferred Stock

As of
December 31, 2007, there were outstanding 276,709,237 Common Shares, 1
Cumulative Preferred Share, and 129,500 Convertible Preferred
Shares.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Company Information and History[edit]
Kiwibox.com was initially founded in 1999 to give teenagers a voice on the internet and was a leader in the teen oriented world for several years. It was founded by three Carnegie Mellon University graduates, Lin Dai, Michael Howard, and Ivan Tumanov. Dai served as the Chief Executive Officer and Editor-in-Chief, Howard as the Chief Operation Officer, and Tumanov as the Chief Technology Officer. The first editors came from Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh, and included Sonni Abatta, now a lead news anchor at WOFL-TV in Orlando.
In August 2007, the company was bought by Magnitude Information Systems, Inc., a publicly listed company.[4] In 2008, the company launched a new version, Kiwibox 2.0 and in October 2009 the company launched Kiwibox 3.0, shifting its audience focus from teenagers to young adults.
