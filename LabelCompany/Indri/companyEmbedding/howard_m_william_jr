Shipwreck: HOWARD M. HANNA JR.
Skip Gillham, Vineland, Ontario, Canada     
This is an anniversary year for the former Great Lakes bulk carrier HOWARD M. 
HANNA JR. The 100th anniversary of its launching comes on April 28 and, on 
June 3, it will be 25 years since the vessel arrived at the scrapyard. 
Considering the adventures, it is amazing that this ship survived 75 years. 
HOWARD M. HANNA JR. was a product of the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company of 
Cleveland, Ohio. The 500 ft long by 54 ft wide freighter was ordered by the 
Richardson Transportation Company and the 5,905 gross ton steamer was soon 
hauling iron ore, coal and grain. It had a carrying capacity of 9,200 tons 
deadweight or 323,000 bushels of grain.
 Ninety-five years ago this fall the 
worst storm in Great Lakes history packed hurricane force winds, mountainous 
waves, rain and then blinding snow, as a massive low pressure area pummeled 
the Great Lakes region from November 8 to November 11, 1913. In its wake, 
there were about a dozen ships on the bottom with no survivors, while others 
were beat-up and aground.
 The coal-laden HOWARD M. HANNA JR., enroute from 
Lorain, Ohio, to Fort William, Ontario, passed Port Huron, Michigan, and 
entered Lake Huron in the early hours of November 9. Those on board had no 
idea of what was ahead. While even bigger ships were overwhelmed and 
disappeared beneath the waves, the HOWARD M. HANNA JR. was caught in the 
trough, rolled menacingly, and came ashore near Port Austin, Michigan.
 The 
vessel sustained smashed windows and other topside damage. The hull cracked at 
the 17th hatch, the ship was flooded aft and the stack toppled. Fortunately 
all 25 sailors on board survived the terrifying ordeal and were saved. Winter 
was coming and efforts to refloat the battered hull did not succeed until the 
following year. During the cold weather season most of the cargo of coal 
disappeared, a pail at a time, to heat local homes.
 In 1914 HOWARD M. HANNA 
JR. was taken to Collingwood and then on to Midland for reconstruction. It did 
not resume service until 1915 when the ship joined the Great Lakes Transit 
Company as GLENSHEE. Another grounding in the St. Mary�s River on October 13, 
1916, was not as serious but the ship needed to be lightered before floating 
free on October 15.
 The vessel joined Canada Steamship Lines in 1926 and was 
renamed MARQUETTE on October 1. It carried some ore between Marquette, 
Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, before tying up for the winter at 
Huron, Ohio. When the vessel sailed the following spring, CSL had renamed it 
GODERICH and it continued to work in the iron ore trade.
 Sixty-five years ago, 
on June 5, 1943, GODERICH was in a collision with the American freighter FRANK 
ARMSTRONG in the St. Mary�s River. The latter was one of sixteen Maritime 
Class ore carriers authorized by the United States Maritime Commission in 
World War Two and was on its maiden voyage. Both ships received significant 
damage.
 Another collision on July 25, 1945, involved the W.W. HOLLOWAY in Lake 
Superior and also required a stop for repairs.
 At the end of the 1962 season, 
GODERICH was tied up at Quebec City, Quebec, pending a sale for scrapping in 
Europe. The Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company stepped up with an 
offer that was accepted and the ship resumed trading on their account as AGAWA,
 45 years ago, in April 1963.
 AGAWA operated through the 1967 season and laid 
up at Goderich with a load of grain. The local storage elevators were 
inadequate for seasonal demands and AGAWA was sold to the Goderich Elevator 
Company in 1968 for use as a storage barge.
 Renamed LIONEL PARSONS, the ship 
worked another 15 years in this capacity until, at the age of 75, it was no 
longer needed. The tug W.J. IVAN PURVIS powered the last trip up the lakes, 
through the Soo Lock and on to Thunder Bay, Ontario, arriving June 3, 1983. 
There the survivor of the Great Storm, several collisions, groundings and a 
near sale for overseas scrapping, was soon dismantled.

M. William Howard, Jr. 1946–
Clergyman 
At a Glance…
Sources
M. William Howard, Jr. has been involved in civil rights and racial justice issues for most of his adult life, and has served at local, national, and world levels in his ecumenical work. From his days at Morehouse College and the civil rights movements of the 1960s, his service in key positions with the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches, and his position as head of the New York Theological Institute, he has constantly worked to better the lives of millions of people. Howard has met many influential people and world leaders, and has traveled throughout the world. He has had his addresses and writing published in magazines, journals, newsletters, and newspapers, has appeared on a number of television and radio shows, and has received several honorary degrees, keys to cities, and awards.
Moses William Howard, Jr. was born on March 3, 1946, in Americus, Georgia, to M. William Howard and Laura (Turner) Howard. He attended segregated Sumter High School in Americus and graduated in 1963. During the turbulent 1960s, Howard took part in African American demonstrations for civil rights, and was a follower of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, and served as a researcher on the autobiography of Benjamin E. Mays. Mays was a nationally noted educator and the sixth president of Morehouse College. He was also a mentor to Martin Luther King, Jr., who was a 1948 Morehouse College graduate. Howard received his bachelor of arts degree from Morehouse in 1968. He married Barbara Jean Wright in 1970 and the couple would have three children. Howard received his master of divinity degree in 1972 from Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey and was ordained in the American Baptist Church in 1974.
Howard’s clerical career began in 1970 when he became associate pastor for the First Baptist Church in Princeton, New Jersey, where he served for two years. He also served as the chaplain for United Campus Ministry at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey from 1971 to 1972. That year, he became the executive director of the African American Council for the Reformed Church in America, and would go on to serve for 20 years as a member of the national staff. Having grown up in the South, Howard was familiar with racism and segregation. As he told Christianity Today, “If I were to say that picking cotton in the hot sun in southwest Georgia, and hearing grandmothers being referred to as ’girl’ by teen-age, white men has not informed my ministry, I would be telling you a lie.”
In 1974 Howard began his association with the National Council of Churches (NCC), a community of Protestant and Eastern Orthodox member church bodies. The council maintains programs dealing with religious and social issues, including civil rights, domestic social justice, worldwide relief and development, Christian education, and many other areas. Howard would serve in several leadership capacities. He was moderator of the Third World Peoples Conference on Development, and served as Chair, Commission on Justice, Liberation and Human Fulfillment from 1974 to 1978. During this time he also served the World Council of Churches, become an advisor to the Fifth Assembly,

Nairobi, Kenya, and participated in a Pre-Assembly youth meeting in Tanzania. Howard also served for two years as the moderator for the Commission on the Program to Combat Racism. The World Council of Churches, which was founded in 1948, is an international fellowship of more than 330 churches, denominations, and fellowships in 100 countries and territories throughout the world with about 400 million Christians as members. It was formed to serve and advance the ecumenical movement.
During Pope John Paul ll’s visit to the United States in 1979, Howard read the Gospel during an ecumenical service. That same year, he became the youngest person and the second African American president of the NCC, the largest ecumenical body in the nation. By 2000 the membership rolls of the NCC had increased to 35 Protestant, Orthodox, and Anglican member churches with nearly 52 million congregants. When Howard became president of the NCC his goal, among others, was to strengthen the existing racial and social justice programs. In a Christianity Today article, he was referred to as “a specialist in racial justice” for his work in the movement against apartheid in South Africa. When Howard’s term as president of the NCC ended, he served for two years as chair of the Information Committee. He also became a delegate of World Consultation on Racism in the Netherlands.
During the 1980s Howard served as a member on several committees or boards, including the American Cancer Society, People for the American Way, Trenton State College, the Children’s Defense Fund, and the National Urban League. In the fight against apartheid, he served as Chairman on the United Nations Seminar Against Bank Loans to South Africa. When Reverend Jesse Jackson made his bid for the presidency of the United States in 1984, Howard served as floor leader at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. That same year, he served as president of the North American Regional Conference on Action Against Apartheid, the largest United Nations-sponsored conference of anti-apartheid activities ever held in the United States and Canada. Howard served as president of the board of directors for the American Committee on Africa, and presented testimonies on southern Africa and human rights issues before the U.S. Congress and the United Nations. In 1990, he was chairman of the Religious Sub-Committee of the New York Nelson Mandela Welcome Committee.
Howard has also served in several special assignments. In 1979, he conducted Christmas services for U.S. Embassy personnel held hostage in Teheran, Iran. In 1980, Howard chaired a fact-finding mission to the Middle East and held talks with King Hussein of Jordan, Menachem Begin, Shimon Peres, and Teddy Kolleck of Israel. He has traveled extensively to serve in various ecumenical capacities and has visited Armenia, Bermuda, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Iran, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, The Netherlands, Peoples Republic of China, Puerto Rico, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Switzerland, Syria, and Zimbabwe. He headed the National Council of Churches’ first post-revolution delegation to Cuba in 1977. In 1984, Howard chaired a delegation led by Reverend Jesse Jackson that obtained the release of a U.S. Navy pilot who was shot down and taken prisoner during a bombing mission over Lebanon.
In 1992 Howard became president of New York Theological Seminary (NYTS), beginning an eight-year tenure with the graduate school of theology. Under his leadership NYTS, the largest Christian seminary in the 
state of New York with nearly 500 students, was accredited for a ten-year period by the Association of Theological Schools. In addition, the school’s information systems and technology departments received two comprehensive upgrades, the board of trustees was reorganized and strengthened, the endowment was almost doubled, new teaching programs were inaugurated, and the seminary partnered with two universities in New York to offer joint programs for the master of divinity degree in urban studies and social work. Howard answered the call to pastor Bethany Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey in 2000. He told the New York Amsterdam News, “God’s sending me to Bethany feels like the next logical step in the progression of my ministry—closer to people and the challenges they face.”

Where to start

Making the decision going to college, pursuing an advanced degree or obtaining an industry recognized certificate is one of the most important decisions an individual will make in their lifetime. When considering an educational institution there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account before an education decision can be made. 
Here are the main factors to consider when looking at pursuing an advanced degree or completing a certificate program:
Online VS In Person: This is the first fundamental question that prospective students need to ask themselves. If you are the kind of person that is self driven, has a tight schedule or is not in a commutable distance to an in person institution, then pursuing an online degree could be a good fit. However, if you find yourself needing to be in a physical classroom environment and learn better that way, then you should seek out in person programs that can better suite your needs. People learn in all different kinds of ways. Some are visual learners, some experiential and some need to hear things to have the information really sink in. No one knows himself or herself better than you, so listen to your gut and first determine what kind of learner you are before embarking on the next steps. Rasmssen College goes into greater depth about the plusses and minuses of online v.s. traditional educational settings. 
Career Opportunities: When exploring areas of study that you are interested in, one recommendation is to first explore the types of jobs and careers in that industry. Often times people find that after obtaining a degree that has set them back a significant amount of money, that the career field that they have their degree in is either not growing or is underpaid in relation to the cost of the degree. We suggest exploring a variety of careers and use the information contained here in conjunction with The Bureau of Labor and Statistics Data to determine if you are making a wise investment in your degree. All of the statistics we have assembled on career and degree data come from the BLS website and are intended to help students make wise decisions about their studies and career options with a degree or certificate. 



 
Time Commitment: The amount of time that you have available to apply to your studies is going to be one of the most important factors in your decision. If you are working a full time job, you will have to figure out a way of balancing your personal life, with your schoolwork. This article from US News and World Report will help you come up with a game plan for managing your time
Financial Aid, Scholarships and Student Loans: Once you have decided that you want to go to college and have a career path planned out once you obtain your degree, then it’s time to figure out how to pay for the degree. Most institutions have different financing options that you will have to do your homework on, but all usually have some form of financial aid or scholarships available. When looking for information on student aid and the resources available to students, we recommend starting at the Federal Student Aid website. This is an office of the U.S. Department of Education and here, students will find a wealth of resources and information that will help them better determine what kind of aid or grants are available to them.
