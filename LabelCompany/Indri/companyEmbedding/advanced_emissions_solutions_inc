Download Brochure



ADAir™ Mixer Technology 




The ADAir™ Mixer is an in-duct static mixing technology that improves sorbent dispersion to increase pollutant capture and decrease sorbent consumption as part of an optimized compliance strategy.
The fixed vanes of the ADAir-Mixer induce counter rotating flow and intersecting turbulence patterns to improve gas mixing and sorbent contact with pollutants without using any moving parts or additional compressed air or blowers.
Download Brochure



Dry Sorbent Injection Systems




The ADA DSI system design incorporates ADA’s best-in-class air pollution control process expertise to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations, and provide operational support. ADA DSI systems are specifically designed around the existing plant equipment, fuel, and process conditions to ensure low capital and operating costs.

RESPond® FGC Technology




RESPond® FGC Technology is a highly effective surface ash resistivity modifier for power plants operating cold-side ESPs requiring flue gas conditioning (FGC). Replacing SO3 FGC with RESPond® FGC Technology not only supports opacity and particulate emissions compliance, it also reduces the costs of mercury control as well as the risks of mercury non-compliance.

M-Prove™ Coal Additives




Our M-Prove Technology provides a cost-effective alternative to other halogen-based, coal additives used for enhanced mercury removal. Our product minimizes corrosion risks to cut maintenance and repair costs, enhancing system reliability.  We limit the amount of halogen added to the system, which also reduces the risk of halogens leaching from ash, or impacting wastewater treatment systems or downstream waterways.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes of Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. ("ADES" or the "Company") included elsewhere in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes of ADES included in our 2016 Form 10-K. Overview ADES serves as the holding entity for a family of companies that provide emissions solutions to customers in the coal-fired power generation and industrial boiler industries. Through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, we are a leader in emissions control ("EC") technologies and associated equipment, chemicals and services. Our proprietary environmental technologies enable our customers to reduce emissions of mercury and other pollutants, maximize utilization levels and improve operating efficiencies to meet the challenges of existing and pending EC regulations. Our major activities include: Development and sale of technology to reduce emissions and improve operations of coal-fired boilers used for power generation and industrial processes; and   Development and sale of equipment, specialty chemicals, consulting services and other products designed to reduce emissions of mercury, acid gases, metals and other pollutants, and the providing of technology services in support of our customers' emissions compliance strategies; and   Through Tinuum Group LLC ("Tinuum Group"), an unconsolidated entity, the reduction of mercury and nitrogen oxide ("NOX") emissions at select coal-fired power generators through the burning of refined coal ("RC") produced by RC facilities placed in service by Tinuum Group. We benefit from Tinuum Group's production and sale of RC, which lowers emissions and generates tax credits, as well as the revenue from selling or leasing RC facilities to tax equity investors. See the separately filed financial statements of Tinuum Group and the other related RC entities within our 2016 Form 10-K.  Results of Operations  Generally, this improved performance during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 can be attributed to a combination of factors, including:   Across the board reductions in all categories of expenses, driven by restructuring activities in April and July 2016 and by a reduction in resources to complete the re-audit and restatement of prior financial statements (the "Restatement"), with such activities related to the Restatement being substantially completed by April 2016;  The following sections provide additional information regarding these comparative periods. For comparability purposes, the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The period-to-period comparison of financial results may not be indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 Total Revenue and Cost of Revenue A summary of the components of our revenues and cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2017 2016 ($) (%) Revenues: Equipment sales $ 5,108 $ 21,727 $ (16,619 ) (76 )% Chemicals 2,281 434 1,847 426 % Consulting services and other - 196 (196 ) (100 )% Total revenues $ 7,389 $ 22,357 $ (14,968 ) (67 )% Operating expenses: Equipment sales cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization $ 4,143 $ 17,034 $ (12,891 ) (76 )% Chemicals cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization $ 1,758 $ 142 $ 1,616 1,138 % Consulting services cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization $ - $ 135 $ (135 ) (100 )%  Equipment sales and Equipment sales cost of revenue, exclusive of items shown separately below  Consulting services and Consulting services cost of revenue We also provide consulting services related to emissions regulations. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, revenues decreased quarter over quarter due to a decrease in the number of consulting service engagements performed. The decrease in the number of consulting services engagements was in part due to us no longer performing consulting services related to certain equipment systems previously installed. Due to diminishing market demand, we do not believe this revenue component will be material in the near term. Additional information related to revenue concentrations and contributions by class and reportable segment can be found within the segment discussion below and in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Operating Expenses   Three Months Ended March 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2017 2016 ($) (%) Operating expenses: Payroll and benefits $ 2,182 $ 3,802 $ (1,620 ) (43 )% Rent and occupancy 45 394 (349 ) (89 )% Legal and professional fees 1,035 2,983 (1,948 ) (65 )% General and administrative 1,263 745 518 70 % Research and development, net 192 202 (10 ) (5 )% Depreciation and amortization 482 231 251 109 % $ 5,199 $ 8,357 $ (3,158 ) (38 )%  Payroll and benefits  Rent and occupancy  Legal and professional fees  Depreciation and amortization  Other Income (Expense), net A summary of the components of our other income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2017 2016 ($) (%) Other income (expense): Earnings from equity method investments $ 13,814 $ 5,577 $ 8,237 148 % Royalties, related party 1,755 1,189 566 48 % Interest expense (693 ) (1,964 ) 1,271 (65 )% Revision in estimated royalty indemnity liability 2,900 - 2,900 * Other income 9 2,938 (2,929 ) (100 )% Total other income $ 17,785 $ 7,740 $ 10,045 130 %  * Calculation not meaningful  Earnings from equity method investments   Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 Earnings from Tinuum Group $ 13,175 $ 5,443 Earnings from Tinuum Services 639 691 Loss from RCM6 - (557 ) Earnings from equity method investments $ 13,814 $ 5,577  Earnings from equity method investments, and changes related thereto, are impacted by our equity method investees: Tinuum Group, Tinuum Services and RCM6 (through the date of the sale of our interest in RCM6 on March 3, 2016). Earnings from equity method investments increased during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 due to an increase in cash distributions in excess of our investment balance from Tinuum Group.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized $13.2 million in equity income from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $10.5 million for the period. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized $5.4 million in equity earnings from Tinuum Group compared to our proportionate share of Tinuum Group's net income of $8.7 million for the period. The difference between our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income and our earnings from our Tinuum Group equity method investment as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations is the result of previously received distributions from Tinuum Group being in excess of the carrying value of the investment, and therefore we recognize such excess distributions as equity method earnings in the period the distributions occur, as discussed in more detail below.  The carrying value of our investment in Tinuum Group was zero as of March 31, 2017, as cumulative cash distributions received from Tinuum Group exceeded our pro-rata share of cumulative earnings in Tinuum Group. The carrying value of our investment in Tinuum Group will remain zero as long as the cumulative amount of distributions received from Tinuum Group continues to exceed our cumulative pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's net income. For quarterly periods during which the ending balance of our investment in Tinuum Group is zero, we only recognize equity earnings from Tinuum Group to the extent that cash distributions are received from Tinuum Group during the period. For quarterly periods during which the ending balance of our investment is greater than zero (e.g., when the cumulative earnings in Tinuum Group exceeds cumulative cash distributions received), we recognize our pro-rata share of Tinuum Group's earnings (losses) for the period, less any amount necessary to recover the cumulative earnings short-fall balance as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter. See additional information related to our investment balance, equity earnings (losses) and cash distributions in Note 3 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, Tinuum Group had 14 and 13 invested RC facilities, respectively, that were generating rental income. Tinuum Group did not have any retained RC facilities that were generating operating income or losses, or Internal Revenue Code Section 45 tax credits ("PTCs") and other tax benefits as of March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Equity earnings from our interest in Tinuum Services decreased by $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. Tinuum Services provided operating and maintenance services to 14 and 13 operating RC facilities, respectively. Tinuum Services derives earnings both from fixed-fee arrangements as well as fees that are based on actual RC production, depending upon the specific RC facility operating and maintenance agreement.  During February 2014, we purchased a membership interest in RCM6 and recognized in all subsequent reporting periods equity method losses resulting from the operation of the RC facility owned by RCM6; although, RCM6 generated tax credits and tax benefits that are available to us. Equity losses from our interest in RCM6 decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to the sale of our 24.95% membership interest in RCM6 on March 3, 2016 for a cash payment of $1.8 million and assumption of the outstanding note payable made by us in connection with our purchase of RCM6 membership interests from Tinuum Group in February 2014. As a result of the sale, we are no longer a member of RCM6 and are no longer subject to any quarterly capital calls and variable payments to RCM6.  We earned the following tax credits that may be available for future benefit related to the production of RC from the operation of retained RC facilities:  Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016  The decrease in tax credits earned during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 was due to suspending operations on retained facilities, as well as the sale of RCM6 in March 2016. Tax credits earned during the three months ended March 31, 2017 relate to the temporary retained operation of an RC facility prior to its lease/sale to a tax equity investor. Additional information related to our equity method investees is included in Note 3 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Royalties, related party  Interest expense  RCM6 note payable in March 2016. These decreases were $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Other  Gain on settlement of note payable  Income tax expense  For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we did not record any federal income tax expense primarily due to the utilization of federal net operating losses and the Company's full valuation allowance against federal net operating losses and federal tax credits. Income tax expense for this quarter included only state income tax expense.  Business Segments   Segment revenue includes our equity method earnings and losses from our equity method investments. Segment revenue also includes our royalty earnings from Tinuum Group and income related to sales-type leases.   Segment operating income (loss) includes our equity method earnings and losses from our equity method investments, royalty earnings from Tinuum Group and gains related to sales of equity method investments. However, segment operating income (loss) excludes Payroll and benefits, Rent and occupancy, Legal and professional fees, and General and administrative ("Corporate general and administrative expenses") unless otherwise specifically included, as we do not allocate those amounts between segments.   All items not included in operating income, except as noted below, are excluded from the RC and EC segments.  The principal products and services of our segments are:  2. EC - Our EC segment includes revenues and related expenses from the sale of ACI and DSI equipment systems, chemical sales, consulting services and other sales related to the reduction of emissions in the coal-fired electric generation process and the electric utility industry. These amounts are included within the respective revenue and cost of sales line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Management uses segment operating income (loss) to measure profitability and performance at the segment level. Management believes segment operating income  underlying trends of the businesses. Segment operating income (loss) may not be indicative of our overall consolidated performance and therefore, should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table presents our operating segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:   Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 Revenues: Refined Coal: Earnings in equity method investments $ 13,814 $ 5,577 Royalties 1,755 1,189 15,569 6,766 Emissions Control: Equipment sales 5,108 21,727 . . .

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
