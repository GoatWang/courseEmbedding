DIRK KEMPTHORNE was born in San Diego and attended the University of Idaho. Kempthorne served seven years as the mayor of Boise. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in November 1992. His first bill to end unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments became Senate Bill 1 in the 104th Congress. He also authored the new Safe Drinking Water Act in 1996. Kempthorne was elected governor of Idaho in 1998 and reelected in 2002. He championed mandatory sentences for methamphetamine manufacturing. He initiated a program to enhance Idaho's highways by improving safety and expanding intra-state commerce. He worked with neighboring states to develop a state-based solution for returning salmon runs in the region. Following the wildfires of 2000, he worked to change the approach to forest health and wildfire management. Under his leadership, Idaho developed wolf and grizzly bear management plans aimed at delisting the endangered species and protecting states' rights. He established a statewide voluntary immunization registry to ensure Idaho children receive pediatrician-recommended vaccinations, and signed into law an initiative for Idaho children to read at grade level by the third grade. During Kempthorne's tenure, Idaho instituted the first-ever tax credit for companies that expand high-speed voice and data broadband communications lines, and provided funding for 12 regional economic development experts across the state. Kempthorne's economic development efforts included fostering rural economic development; intensifying overseas marketing of Idaho products; securing a tax credit for new and expanding businesses in Idaho; and improving integration of the state's scientific, educational, and business communities. Kempthorne also was responsible for seeing Idaho through its worst recession since the Great Depression. Kempthorne earned the Distinguished Service Medal, the top civilian honor from the Idaho National Guard. Kempthorne is a past chairman of the National Governors Association as well as lead governor on National Guard issues. He is past chair of the Western Governors' Association and past president of the Council of State Governments, and chaired the Public Policy Committee of the Republican Governors Association. Kempthorne stepped down as governor of Idaho on May 26, 2006 when he was officially sworn in as U.S. secretary of the interior. Sources: Archived Wepage: Gov.

Dirk Arthur Kempthorne (born October 29, 1951) is an American politician who was the United States Secretary of the Interior from 2006 to 2009, serving under President George W. Bush. A Republican, Kempthorne previously served as a United States Senator from Idaho from 1993 to 1999 and as the 30th Governor of Idaho from 1999 to 2006. He is known for his conservative views, particularly on economic issues.
Kempthorne was first elected to public office as mayor of Boise in 1985, where he served for seven years.
Kempthorne serves as a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.[2] In November 2010, he was appointed president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers.[3]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

Kempthorne Awarded Honorary Doctorate in Recognition of Service to State, Nation 

                        May 02, 2017
                    


Dirk Kempthorne has always wanted to help people.
“It probably comes from how my mom and dad raised me. I’ve always had a deep respect for other people,” said Kempthorne, who served as governor of Idaho from 1999-2006. “I’ve always believed that you should make a difference, wherever you are.”
That belief led Kempthorne to enroll as a pre-med major at the University of Idaho in the 1970s, as well as an orderly at Gritman Medical Center in Moscow. But as he pursued the medical field, he found his interests shifting.
“I started out as a pre-med student, and I didn’t do really well in physics or in chemistry,” he said. “And then I kept finding that rather than go to the fourth floor of the library — where the medical books were — I kept ending up on the third floor, in the political science books.” 
Kempthorne switched his major to political science, and earned his bachelor’s degree from what is now the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) in 1975. Two years later, on Sept. 18, he married another UI graduate, Patricia Merrill, at sunrise on top of nearby Moscow Mountain.
This May, Kempthorne will return to UI and finally receive the title “doctor,” although still not in medicine: The university has awarded Kempthorne an Honorary Doctor of Administrative Science. He will receive the honor during the commencement ceremony May 13 in Moscow.
“It’s come full circle: I go to UI to become a doctor, I switch from pre-med to political science, but I’m now being invited back to become a doctor,” he said.
Kempthorne was nominated for the award by CLASS Dean Andrew Kersten, who wanted to acknowledge the many contributions Kempthorne has made to the university, the Palouse and the state.
“I greatly appreciate the efforts of Dean Kersten and President Chuck Staben. I am so greatly honored to receive this recognition from my alma mater,” Kempthorne said. 
During his time as governor, Kempthorne championed an education safety initiative that led to a rebuilt Troy High School, and another investment project that remodeled UI’s Teaching and Learning Center. He also led the way on an investment in highway safety, which resulted in 57 projects around the state — improvements that, according to the Idaho Transportation Department and Idaho State Police, save at least 88 lives per year.
“Dirk Kempthorne provides our students with a shining example of how a University of Idaho experience, a degree in the College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences, a positive outlook on life, and hard work can catapult a person into a rewarding life of public service,” Kersten said. “We in CLASS are so proud of our distinguished alumnus and his accomplishments, and we are honored to have him back this May to participate in our commencement.”
Kempthorne was nominated to be the 49th Secretary of the Interior in 2006 by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. He continued his passionate service to people, being a champion of the national park system and successfully getting the polar bear listed as a threatened species. 
In 2009, he stepped down from the Department of Interior and began a new phase of his career as president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) in 2010. ACLI represents nearly 300 member companies, about 94 percent of the life insurance industry assets in the United States. Kempthorne is still focused on helping people, tackling big problems and working across political labels to achieve his organization’s goals. 
“My motivation for 23 years of public service was to help people, and with the life insurance industry — its mission is to help people,” Kempthorne said. “And one of the things that probably I took away from working at Gritman hospital was the experience of working with human beings. They were in the hospital and did not feel well. They need others to help them. I saw what it was for the elderly that were frail and sometimes you saw concern in their eyes, and one of the things that motivates me at ACLI is I think people should have dignity their entire life. It shouldn’t be something where you achieved the American dream, you outlived your retirement savings and now your dignity is in question.”

Dirk Kempthorne: ‘Make a Difference’





Former governor awarded honorary doctorate for his service to state, nation
Dirk Kempthorne has always wanted to help people.
“It probably comes from how my mom and dad raised me. I’ve always had a deep respect for other people,” said Kempthorne, who served as governor of Idaho from 1999-2006. “I’ve always believed that you should make a difference, wherever you are.”
That belief led Kempthorne to enroll as a pre-med major at the University of Idaho in the 1970s, as well as an orderly at Gritman Medical Center in Moscow. But as he pursued the medical field, he found his interests shifting.
“I started out as a pre-med student, and I didn’t do really well in physics or in chemistry,” he said. “And then I kept finding that rather than go to the fourth floor of the library — where the medical books were — I kept ending up on the third floor, in the political science books.” 
Kempthorne switched his major to political science, and earned his bachelor’s degree from what is now the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences in 1975.
Two years later, on Sept. 18, he married another UI graduate, Patricia Merrill, at sunrise on top of nearby Moscow Mountain.
This May, Kempthorne will return to UI and finally receive the title “doctor,” although still not in medicine: The university has awarded Kempthorne an Honorary Doctor of Administrative Science. He will receive the honor during the commencement ceremony May 13 in Moscow.
“It’s come full circle: I go to UI to become a doctor, I switch from pre-med to political science, but I’m now being invited back to become a doctor,” he said.

Career in Service
The beginning of Kempthorne’s self-proclaimed “unorthodox” career as an elected public servant began at UI, when he was elected president of the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI). While a student, Kempthorne championed the effort to construct the roof of the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center. 
The effort gave Kempthorne the opportunity to practice what would become a signature of his political style: Diplomacy and a willingness to work with everyone.
“I went to every living group, I met with all of them,” Kempthorne said. “I discussed what the facts and figures were, what the pluses and minuses were. We got the support of the student body to proceed.”
In the 1980s at age 33, Kempthorne made his first run at public office: for the Boise mayor’s seat. At the time, Kempthorne and Patricia had two young children, and Kempthorne said he felt he could make a difference in Boise, a city he said was struggling to reach its full potential.
“The political wisdom was, ‘Do not do this.’” Kempthorne said. He was told, “It’s a job that you will not be successful in,” and it would hurt his ability to run for statewide office. “And with all of that good advice, I made the decision to run for mayor.”
As mayor, Kempthorne championed the redevelopment of downtown Boise, including the construction of a long-contested events center. That effort involved bringing together multiple governing bodies to reach an agreement.
“When I was mayor of Boise, I remember saying at the outset, one of the most important things that we must build is cooperation, because when you build cooperation, then — and only then — can you can build with brick and mortar. And that’s what we demonstrated in Boise and that’s what we demonstrated throughout the state,” he said.
In 1992, Kempthorne, a Republican, was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he earned a reputation for his bipartisanship, particularly in efforts with Democratic Sen. John Glenn to curb unfunded government mandates. In the late ’90s, Kempthorne decided to leave Washington, D.C., and run for governor of Idaho. He was elected in 1998.
Rebuilding Idaho
Kempthorne has never been afraid to tackle big projects. 
“When you see situations where perhaps results have eluded people, I find those the most intriguing and the most challenging,” Kempthorne said. “I approach them with a great deal of enthusiasm, to see if we can’t find the solution.”
As governor of Idaho, Kempthorne inherited a few big problems: A backlog of unsafe public schools throughout the state and hazardous roads statewide. He tackled the school safety issue by creating a statewide government and community partnership that led to the construction of such new schools as Troy High School, among other building improvements. 
His passion to fix Idaho’s highway system stemmed from personal experience: While serving as ASUI president, Kempthorne and two other ASUI members were returning to Moscow from a winter legislative trip to Boise when their car went off the road. 
“We hit a bad part of the road right there by Banks on Highway 55. The car flipped. It rolled a number of times — and I can remember still the shock of that,” Kempthorne said. “Had it not been for the snowbanks, we’d have gone right in to the river and that would have been it. 
“I knew we needed to tackle the roads, and so we did.”
Kempthorne’s leadership resulted in 57 different projects around the state — improvements that, according to the Idaho Transportation Department and Idaho State Police, save at least 88 lives per year. Many of those lives are Idaho students traveling the highways to go home for holidays and breaks. But the work didn’t come without compromise, and politicians agreeing to work together.
At first, the Idaho House of Representatives killed Kempthorne’s road legislation. When reporters asked Kempthorne how it felt to see his work dismissed, he said “Well, my mother and father taught me to believe in and practice the Golden Rule. But I’ve now learned, through this process, sometimes you must simply rule.” 
Kempthorne selected eight pieces of legislation that simply awaited his signature, and vetoed them, announcing, “I will continue this until we finally get some cooperation and communication around here.”
The road legislation was revived the next day. 
Planning for the Future
Kempthorne was nominated to be the 49th Secretary of the Interior in 2006 by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. He continued his passionate service of people, being a champion of the national park system and successfully getting the polar bear listed as a threatened species. 
In 2009, he stepped down from the Department of Interior and began a new phase of his career as president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) — but the passion of his life remains unchanged.
“My motivation for 23 years of public service was to help people, and with the life insurance industry — its mission is to help people,” Kempthorne said. “And one of the things that probably I took away from working at Gritman hospital was the experience of working with human beings. They were in the hospital and did not feel well. They need others to help them. I saw what it was for the elderly that were frail and sometimes you saw concern in their eyes, and one of the things that motivates me at ACLI is I think people should have dignity their entire life. It shouldn’t be something where you achieved the American dream, you outlived your retirement savings and now your dignity is in question.”
ACLI represents nearly 300 member companies, about 94 percent of the life insurance industry assets in the United States. Kempthorne is still focused on helping people, tackling big problems and working across political labels to achieve his organization’s goals.
For UI students, Kempthorne has a few pieces of advice: Find your passion, be a good listener and work with people who think differently than you do.
“Go in first with the attitude that you will respect other views, that you will be an active listener,” Kempthorne said. “Realize that if you will also set aside rhetoric and help diffuse rhetoric in others, you will then achieve results. And isn’t that why you went into service in the first place?
“It all boils down to people. Find the best in all of us. Sometimes it takes a little more effort in some — but if you can find that, you can all celebrate the victory.”

Submitted by d2 on Thu, 03/16/2006 - 4:33pm.

(Welcome, Buzzflash and Wonkette readers!  You might want to bookmark this page and check back for updates.)
It is widely rumored that:

Dirk Kempthorne has an 'illegitimate' child.  I used quotes because I loathe that word-- the one person it hurts most is the kid, and they don't deserve it.  
When Dirk Kempthorne went to DC as a Senator, he took a special aide with him.
While in DC, Dirk Kempthorne was known as the Kennedy of the Republican Party -- and not for his stance on civil rights.
His exit from senatorial life was because Dirk's wife, Patricia Kempthorne, insisted that he end the affair and/or the philandering.
In spite of that ultimatum, the mistress followed Dirk Kempthorne back to Idaho, and currently lives either in Boise or McCall.

The press has always shied away from this, and details have always been sparse, but maybe someone in Boise or McCall (rumored digs for the mistress and their child) would assemble the details needed to break this story out and put the Rovian spin-machine back off message for a few days.  At the least, Kempthorne's nomination is an opportunity to videotape some obviously-lying non-denial-denials by key Idaho Republicans for use next fall during Idaho wingnuts' Bigotry against Gays Marriage mudfest.
Presuming Patricia won't get interviewed by Oprah or a cameo on Desperate Housewives, Kempthorne's nomination leaves so many unanswered questions:

Are the former aide and Dirk Junior going to be packing for the trip, or will Patricia be Dirk's only companion this time?
Will Kempthorne be like Steve Symms divorcing his seriously-ill wife, or does he prefer Patricia brush up on her Tammy Wynette singing while he enjoys a steady stream of minor dalliances, a la Butch Otter?
With neocons and fundamentalists screaming about sanctity of marriage, why do Kempthorne, Otter, and other Idaho Republicans hate the noble institution of marriage?
And the national question: Would a scandal like this shred another percentage point off Bush's approval rating?  Admittedly, it's such poor taste to distract the president from his Two Priorities: Iraq and the November elections (a speech which immediately brought Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition sketch to mind).  But I like to hope that each day the Cheney administration is off-message is another day alive for several Iraqi civilians (and Iranians).  If so, that'd almost be enough to attone for Idaho wingnuts STILL mustering a 50% approval rating yesterday for Bush.

AT LAST, we'll have a cabinet member that unabashedly likes their pages bent over.  And the left can argue that as a cabinet member, Dirk opens the chance that if someone has an affair we'll finally get an impeachment.  Right?!  (pause, listen for the DLC and the entire republican party... nothing but crickets).

Bush taking a single question from Helen Thomas yesterday doesn't cancel five years of his ducking the public like he has.  Heck, even here in the reddest of red states, our eyes tell us that Bush just jumped the shark.

Patricia to Dirk:  Buh-bye! Submitted by d2 on Wed, 03/22/2006 - 8:50pm.
The rumors of Dirk Kempthorne's marital infidelities always include Patricia Kempthorne's ultimatum about hell freezing over before she'd return to DC.  
And Patricia's comments yesterday to newspeople in Boise confirm:  If Dirk becomes Secretary of Interior, Patricia Kempthorne will NOT join him.  She'll stay in Idaho.  That, plus a smattering of Dirk's other misdeeds, courtesy of Boise Weekly.

				Kirk snow socks have the perfect fit, anatomically correct and seamless toe closures, Y-gore seams, elastic ankle and arch support, self-adjusting welt cuffs and miles of style.


Smooth, seamless toe closure eliminates the seam that is traditionally found across the toe box—this equates to riding pain-free
Left and right specific toe closures ensure the right fit for each foot
Compression technology improves muscle efficency and circulation
Self-adjusting welt cuffs won't sneak off to the bottom of your boots

Dirk Arthur Kempthorne (born October 29, 1951) is an American politician who was the United States Secretary of the Interior from 2006 to 2009, serving under President George W. Bush. A Republican, Kempthorne previously served as a United States Senator from Idaho from 1993 to 1999 and as the 30th Governor of Idaho from 1999 to 2006. He is known for his conservative views, particularly on economic issues.
Kempthorne was first elected to public office as mayor of Boise in 1985, where he served for seven years.
Kempthorne serves as a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.[2] In November 2010, he was appointed president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers.[3]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

He was reelected in 2002 with 56 percent of the vote, compared to his Democratic opponent, Jerry Brady, who polled 42 percent. Kempthorne's campaign spent nearly $200,000 more than it had received in contributions prior to the election; he spent the next two years raising funds to pay off the campaign debt.[11]

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

A Republican, Kempthorne previously served as a United States Senator from Idaho from 1993 to 1999 and as the 30th Governor of Idaho from 1999 to 2006. He is known for his conservative views, particularly on economic issues.
Kempthorne was first elected to public office as mayor of Boise in 1985, where he served for seven years.
Kempthorne serves as a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.[2] In November 2010, he was appointed president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers.[3]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

He was reelected in 2002 with 56 percent of the vote, compared to his Democratic opponent, Jerry Brady, who polled 42 percent. Kempthorne's campaign spent nearly $200,000 more than it had received in contributions prior to the election; he spent the next two years raising funds to pay off the campaign debt.[11]

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

Early life, education, and early career[edit]
Kempthorne was raised in San Bernardino, California. He attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president.[4] Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.
In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.
Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.
Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.[5]
Political career[edit]
Mayor[edit]
Kempthorne's first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.
U.S. Senate[edit]




Senator Kempthorne


In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings.
In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states.[6] The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.[7]


Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.[8]
During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a "0" on the League of Conservation Voters' legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.[9]
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne's Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

He was reelected in 2002 with 56 percent of the vote, compared to his Democratic opponent, Jerry Brady, who polled 42 percent. Kempthorne's campaign spent nearly $200,000 more than it had received in contributions prior to the election; he spent the next two years raising funds to pay off the campaign debt.[11]

Secretary of the Interior[edit]




Kempthorne is sworn in as Secretary of the Interior
on June 7, 2006.


On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26, and resigned as governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as governor, filling out remaining months of the term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.
Upon Kempthorne's appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has "almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests."[12]
As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.[13]
In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found "abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive" management[14] at the department under Kempthorne's supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the "untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars" to MacDonald's actions.[15] Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said "The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds."[16]
In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne's administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to the New York Times, "Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game.... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials "frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives." The New York Times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne's being sworn into the office.[17]




Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the Insular Areas Health Summit


On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing "regulations... that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act." The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, "The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement."[18]
Kempthorne's appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in Boise, many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as Boise-Cascade (timber), or companies with a long history of EPA violations, J.R. Simplot Corporation. Among his many other previous, large campaign contributors were Hecla mining, ASARCO, and FMC Gold.[19] When confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his Idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection, Kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word, leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages. Kempthorne's reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness, and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling, particularly the US west's natural resources, to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation.
In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using "$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior." According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as "DK" monogrammed towels.[20] Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department's National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.[21][22]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
