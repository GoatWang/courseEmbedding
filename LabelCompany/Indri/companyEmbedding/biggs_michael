Early life[edit]
Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929.[2] As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the RAF. However, he was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.[3]
This time after his release, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage,[4] the daughter of a primary school headmaster.[4] They had three sons together.[3][4]
Great Train Robbery[edit]
Main article: Great Train Robbery (1963)
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,[2] happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. However, he was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.[5] Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.[2][3]
On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire.[4] The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.[6][7] Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region.[8] Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.[2] Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.[9]
Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million; Biggs's share was £147,000.[10] With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.[2]
After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,[2] Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.[2] In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.[2]
Escape and abscondment[edit]
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van.[6][11] He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery.[2][7] During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.[4] Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.[4]
Australia[edit]
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.[7] Biggs loved his new life in Australia although, by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 of his £143,000 share of the haul had been spent: £40,000 on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; the rest on legal fees and expenses.[2][4]
In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. He had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.[7]
Following disclosure of his fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to divorce Biggs in 1974, which was completed in 1976.[4] Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group[12] to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4] She later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons - who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil - live anonymously. In 2012 she acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs – in which she was played by actress Sheridan Smith – which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4][12]
Rio de Janeiro[edit]
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.[11] In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash[13] in Melbourne.[14]
In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.[15]
During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double-bass player), Jaime Shields and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.[16]
In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.[13] Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m.[17] To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley."[18] Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.
Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for "No One is Innocent" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "Belsen Was a Gas" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom[19] (a fact which Chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth)[20] and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.[21] [22] In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation.[23] The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.[24] The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.
Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.
In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "Police on My Back" and "Carnival in Rio" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album "Bajo otra bandera" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.[25][26]
In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.[15] English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.[27][28]
Return to the United Kingdom[edit]
In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.
Imprisonment[edit]
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.[7]
His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was unavailable in Brazil,[29] but that it was his desire to "walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter".[30] John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."[31] Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.[32]
On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.[33] The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.[34] On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live.[35] Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have "difficulty" speaking.
On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds.[36] In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."[37]
In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".[38] His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia.[39][40][41] This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable.[42] News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.[43]
On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,[44] having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.[1] On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."[45]
On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.[46] Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.[47]
Later life[edit]
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.[48] In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."[48] However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."[48]
On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet General Hospital. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".[49] In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.[50]
On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet General Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened.[51] On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw, at Shoreditch House, London.[2] He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.[52]
On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.[53][54]
In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.[55] In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.
Death[edit]
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for.[56][57] His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon.[58] Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.[59] The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse "Judge not, that ye be not judged".[60]

Early life[edit]
Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929.[2] As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the RAF. However, he was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.[3]
This time after his release, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage,[4] the daughter of a primary school headmaster.[4] They had three sons together.[3][4]
Great Train Robbery[edit]
Main article: Great Train Robbery (1963)
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,[2] happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. However, he was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.[5] Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.[2][3]
On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire.[4] The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.[6][7] Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region.[8] Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.[2] Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.[9]
Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million; Biggs's share was £147,000.[10] With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.[2]
After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,[2] Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.[2] In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.[2]
Escape and abscondment[edit]
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van.[6][11] He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery.[2][7] During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.[4] Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.[4]
Australia[edit]
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.[7] Biggs loved his new life in Australia although, by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 of his £143,000 share of the haul had been spent: £40,000 on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; the rest on legal fees and expenses.[2][4]
In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. He had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.[7]
Following disclosure of his fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to divorce Biggs in 1974, which was completed in 1976.[4] Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group[12] to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4] She later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons - who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil - live anonymously. In 2012 she acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs – in which she was played by actress Sheridan Smith – which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4][12]
Rio de Janeiro[edit]
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.[11] In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash[13] in Melbourne.[14]
In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.[15]
During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double-bass player), Jaime Shields and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.[16]
In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.[13] Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m.[17] To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley."[18] Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.
Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for "No One is Innocent" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "Belsen Was a Gas" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom[19] (a fact which Chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth)[20] and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.[21] [22] In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation.[23] The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.[24] The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.
Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.
In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "Police on My Back" and "Carnival in Rio" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album "Bajo otra bandera" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.[25][26]
In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.[15] English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.[27][28]
Return to the United Kingdom[edit]
In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.
Imprisonment[edit]
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.[7]
His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was unavailable in Brazil,[29] but that it was his desire to "walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter".[30] John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."[31] Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.[32]
On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.[33] The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.[34] On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live.[35] Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have "difficulty" speaking.
On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds.[36] In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."[37]
In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".[38] His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia.[39][40][41] This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable.[42] News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.[43]
On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,[44] having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.[1] On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."[45]
On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.[46] Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.[47]
Later life[edit]
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.[48] In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."[48] However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."[48]
On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet General Hospital. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".[49] In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.[50]
On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet General Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened.[51] On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw, at Shoreditch House, London.[2] He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.[52]
On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.[53][54]
In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.[55] In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.
Death[edit]
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for.[56][57] His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon.[58] Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.[59] The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse "Judge not, that ye be not judged".[60]

Early life[edit]
Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929.[2] As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the RAF. However, he was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.[3]
This time after his release, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage,[4] the daughter of a primary school headmaster.[4] They had three sons together.[3][4]
Great Train Robbery[edit]
Main article: Great Train Robbery (1963)
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,[2] happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. However, he was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.[5] Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.[2][3]
On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire.[4] The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.[6][7] Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region.[8] Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.[2] Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.[9]
Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million; Biggs's share was £147,000.[10] With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.[2]
After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,[2] Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.[2] In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.[2]
Escape and abscondment[edit]
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van.[6][11] He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery.[2][7] During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.[4] Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.[4]
Australia[edit]
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.[7] Biggs loved his new life in Australia although, by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 of his £143,000 share of the haul had been spent: £40,000 on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; the rest on legal fees and expenses.[2][4]
In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. He had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.[7]
Following disclosure of his fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to divorce Biggs in 1974, which was completed in 1976.[4] Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group[12] to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4] She later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons - who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil - live anonymously. In 2012 she acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs – in which she was played by actress Sheridan Smith – which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4][12]
Rio de Janeiro[edit]
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.[11] In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash[13] in Melbourne.[14]
In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.[15]
During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double-bass player), Jaime Shields and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.[16]
In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.[13] Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m.[17] To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley."[18] Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.
Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for "No One is Innocent" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "Belsen Was a Gas" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom[19] (a fact which Chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth)[20] and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.[21] [22] In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation.[23] The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.[24] The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.
Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.
In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "Police on My Back" and "Carnival in Rio" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album "Bajo otra bandera" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.[25][26]
In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.[15] English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.[27][28]
Return to the United Kingdom[edit]
In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.
Imprisonment[edit]
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.[7]
His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was unavailable in Brazil,[29] but that it was his desire to "walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter".[30] John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."[31] Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.[32]
On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.[33] The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.[34] On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live.[35] Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have "difficulty" speaking.
On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds.[36] In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."[37]
In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".[38] His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia.[39][40][41] This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable.[42] News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.[43]
On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,[44] having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.[1] On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."[45]
On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.[46] Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.[47]
Later life[edit]
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.[48] In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."[48] However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."[48]
On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet General Hospital. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".[49] In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.[50]
On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet General Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened.[51] On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw, at Shoreditch House, London.[2] He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.[52]
On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.[53][54]
In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.[55] In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.
Death[edit]
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for.[56][57] His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon.[58] Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.[59] The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse "Judge not, that ye be not judged".[60]

In 2001, he returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. Biggs was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009[1] and died in a nursing home in December 2013.

Early life[edit]
Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929.[2] As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the RAF. However, he was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.[3]
This time after his release, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage,[4] the daughter of a primary school headmaster.[4] They had three sons together.[3][4]
Great Train Robbery[edit]
Main article: Great Train Robbery (1963)
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,[2] happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. However, he was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.[5] Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.[2][3]
On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire.[4] The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.[6][7] Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region.[8] Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.[2] Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.[9]
Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million; Biggs's share was £147,000.[10] With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.[2]
After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,[2] Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.[2] In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.[2]
Escape and abscondment[edit]
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van.[6][11] He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery.[2][7] During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.[4] Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.[4]
Australia[edit]
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.[7] Biggs loved his new life in Australia although, by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 of his £143,000 share of the haul had been spent: £40,000 on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; the rest on legal fees and expenses.[2][4]
In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. He had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.[7]
Following disclosure of his fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to divorce Biggs in 1974, which was completed in 1976.[4] Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group[12] to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4] She later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons - who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil - live anonymously. In 2012 she acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs – in which she was played by actress Sheridan Smith – which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4][12]
Rio de Janeiro[edit]
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.[11] In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash[13] in Melbourne.[14]
In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.[15]
During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double-bass player), Jaime Shields and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.[16]
In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.[13] Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m.[17] To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley."[18] Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.
Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for "No One is Innocent" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "Belsen Was a Gas" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom[19] (a fact which Chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth)[20] and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.[21] [22] In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation.[23] The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.[24] The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.
Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.
In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "Police on My Back" and "Carnival in Rio" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album "Bajo otra bandera" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.[25][26]
In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.[15] English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.[27][28]
Return to the United Kingdom[edit]
In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.
Imprisonment[edit]
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.[7]
His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was unavailable in Brazil,[29] but that it was his desire to "walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter".[30] John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."[31] Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.[32]
On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.[33] The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.[34] On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live.[35] Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have "difficulty" speaking.
On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds.[36] In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."[37]
In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".[38] His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia.[39][40][41] This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable.[42] News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.[43]
On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,[44] having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.[1] On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."[45]
On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.[46] Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.[47]
Later life[edit]
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.[48] In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."[48] However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."[48]
On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet General Hospital. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".[49] In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.[50]
On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet General Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened.[51] On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw, at Shoreditch House, London.[2] He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.[52]
On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.[53][54]
In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.[55] In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.
Death[edit]
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for.[56][57] His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon.[58] Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.[59] The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse "Judge not, that ye be not judged".[60]

In 2001, he returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. Biggs was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009[1] and died in a nursing home in December 2013.

Early life[edit]
Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929.[2] As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the RAF. However, he was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.[3]
This time after his release, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage,[4] the daughter of a primary school headmaster.[4] They had three sons together.[3][4]
Great Train Robbery[edit]
Main article: Great Train Robbery (1963)
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,[2] happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. However, he was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.[5] Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.[2][3]
On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire.[4] The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.[6][7] Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region.[8] Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.[2] Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.[9]
Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million; Biggs's share was £147,000.[10] With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.[2]
After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,[2] Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.[2] In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.[2]
Escape and abscondment[edit]
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van.[6][11] He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery.[2][7] During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.[4] Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.[4]
Australia[edit]
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.[7] Biggs loved his new life in Australia although, by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 of his £143,000 share of the haul had been spent: £40,000 on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; the rest on legal fees and expenses.[2][4]
In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. He had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.[7]
Following disclosure of his fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to divorce Biggs in 1974, which was completed in 1976.[4] Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group[12] to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4] She later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons - who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil - live anonymously. In 2012 she acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs – in which she was played by actress Sheridan Smith – which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4][12]
Rio de Janeiro[edit]
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.[11] In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash[13] in Melbourne.[14]
In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.[15]
During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double-bass player), Jaime Shields and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.[16]
In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.[13] Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m.[17] To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley."[18] Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.
Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for "No One is Innocent" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "Belsen Was a Gas" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom[19] (a fact which Chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth)[20] and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.[21] [22] In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation.[23] The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.[24] The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.
Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.
In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "Police on My Back" and "Carnival in Rio" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album "Bajo otra bandera" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.[25][26]
In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.[15] English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.[27][28]
Return to the United Kingdom[edit]
In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.
Imprisonment[edit]
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.[7]
His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was unavailable in Brazil,[29] but that it was his desire to "walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter".[30] John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."[31] Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.[32]
On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.[33] The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.[34] On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live.[35] Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have "difficulty" speaking.
On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds.[36] In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."[37]
In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".[38] His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia.[39][40][41] This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable.[42] News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.[43]
On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,[44] having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.[1] On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."[45]
On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.[46] Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.[47]
Later life[edit]
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.[48] In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."[48] However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."[48]
On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet General Hospital. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".[49] In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.[50]
On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet General Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened.[51] On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw, at Shoreditch House, London.[2] He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.[52]
On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.[53][54]
In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.[55] In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.
Death[edit]
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for.[56][57] His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon.[58] Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.[59] The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse "Judge not, that ye be not judged".[60]

In 2001, he returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. Biggs was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009[1] and died in a nursing home in December 2013.

Early life[edit]
Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929.[2] As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the RAF. However, he was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.[3]
This time after his release, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage,[4] the daughter of a primary school headmaster.[4] They had three sons together.[3][4]
Great Train Robbery[edit]
Main article: Great Train Robbery (1963)
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,[2] happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. However, he was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.[5] Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.[2][3]
On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire.[4] The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.[6][7] Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region.[8] Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.[2] Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.[9]
Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million; Biggs's share was £147,000.[10] With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.[2]
After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,[2] Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.[2] In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.[2]
Escape and abscondment[edit]
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van.[6][11] He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery.[2][7] During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.[4] Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.[4]
Australia[edit]
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.[7] Biggs loved his new life in Australia although, by the time his family arrived in 1966, all but £7,000 of his £143,000 share of the haul had been spent: £40,000 on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; the rest on legal fees and expenses.[2][4]
In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. He had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.[7]
Following disclosure of his fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to divorce Biggs in 1974, which was completed in 1976.[4] Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group[12] to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4] She later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons - who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil - live anonymously. In 2012 she acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs – in which she was played by actress Sheridan Smith – which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.[4][12]
Rio de Janeiro[edit]
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.[11] In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash[13] in Melbourne.[14]
In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.[15]
During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double-bass player), Jaime Shields and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.[16]
In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.[13] Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m.[17] To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley."[18] Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.
Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for "No One is Innocent" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "Belsen Was a Gas" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom[19] (a fact which Chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth)[20] and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.[21] [22] In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation.[23] The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.[24] The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.
Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.
In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "Police on My Back" and "Carnival in Rio" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album "Bajo otra bandera" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.[25][26]
In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.[15] English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.[27][28]
Return to the United Kingdom[edit]
In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.
Imprisonment[edit]
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.[7]
His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was unavailable in Brazil,[29] but that it was his desire to "walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter".[30] John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."[31] Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.[32]
On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.[33] The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.[34] On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live.[35] Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have "difficulty" speaking.
On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds.[36] In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."[37]
In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".[38] His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia.[39][40][41] This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable.[42] News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.[43]
On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,[44] having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.[1] On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."[45]
On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.[46] Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.[47]
Later life[edit]
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.[48] In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."[48] However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."[48]
On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet General Hospital. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".[49] In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.[50]
On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet General Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened.[51] On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw, at Shoreditch House, London.[2] He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.[52]
On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.[53][54]
In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.[55] In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.
Death[edit]
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for.[56][57] His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon.[58] Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.[59] The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse "Judge not, that ye be not judged".[60]

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Biggs has the knowledge, skill, and dedication that it takes to navigate the judicial system and vigorously assert your interests.

Mr. Biggs has learned how to foster relationships with a wide variety of individuals and strives to maintain clear communication with clients, colleagues, and the courts at each step of the process. He takes pride in thinking outside the box, which provides an extra edge that can make a positive difference.Mr. Biggs recognizes that court proceedings are adversarial, which means that they require combining top-notch investigatory skill, tactical judgment, and strategic focus with a precise application of the law. He is clear, concise, and to the point in using every means at his disposal to further the goals of each client. The Law Offices of Michael S. Biggs is ready to assist people throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including in Marin, Sonoma, Solano, and Contra Costa Counties.

He is available to meet with clients at any of these locations.Representing Victims in Personal Injury CasesMarin County personal injury lawyer Michael S. Biggs has experience assisting people who have been hurt as a result of someone else’s negligent or intentionally harmful acts. In general, each of us owes others a duty to act with the same level of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in a similar situation. Negligence often arises in situations involving drivers who fail to handle their vehicles safely, property owners that have dangerous conditions on their premises, and medical professionals who provide inadequate care, as well as companies that make unreasonably dangerous products that harm consumers.The damages that may be available in these cases often include compensation for medical expenses, the costs of future treatment, lost wages and earning capacity, property damage, and pain and suffering. It is important to seek legal counsel promptly so that evidence useful to your case may be gathered and all procedural guidelines are followed. Michael S. Biggs is ready to fight for your rights to the fullest extent of the law.Assistance with Resolving Estates and Trusts DisputesMr. Biggs frequently represents beneficiaries and trustees in cases involving the distribution of trust assets. When it comes to administering a trust, a trustee has certain legal obligations and duties regarding how the trust must be maintained and administered. Since trustees oversee assets and funds for the benefit of the beneficiaries, they have a fiduciary duty to use due care in exercising their power and to make decisions that are in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Common examples of legal disputes that may arise regarding a trust include breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty, self-dealing, failure to distribute trust assets, and failure to provide an accounting.Experienced Guidance for Business Law MattersEvery business owner, investor, or entrepreneur hopes that he or she will never need to hire an attorney to resolve a legal dispute. All too often, however, people are unable to resolve these issues independently, necessitating guidance from a dedicated and experienced lawyer. Michael S. Biggs frequently advises people about disputes involving a breach of contract, interference with prospective economic advantage and business sales.Mr. Biggs has substantial experience helping individuals navigate partnership and joint venture dissolutions, as well as investigating claims of breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation. Business partners owe certain duties to one another and the business to act with due care and candor. If a partner fails to act according to this standard, it can create a serious rift that prevents the business from moving forward.Employment Law/Public SectorMr. Biggs has represented public sector employees in state and federal court who have been victims of contrived allegations or retaliated against for whistleblowing. Mr. Biggs also has experience with issues involving union memorandums of understanding (MOU) contract rights, Skelly Hearings, and arbitrations. Having had extensive litigation experience in the area of constitutional due process rights, Mr. Biggs has a reputation as the “go to lawyer” when unions fail or simply have not been able to vigorously defend the interest of their members.

In the beginning the insurance adjuster seemed like they were looking out for my best interest, but that soon changed when I asked about getting a second opinion from a doctor of my choosing. Soon after my weekly benefits were cut off, because of the doctor they(insurance company) sent me to said something other than what the doctor I went to for a second opinion said. I immediately hired Dennis Phelps as my work comp attorney. The power trip was over for the insurance company adjuster. Weekly benefits were reinstated and recommendations from that second opinion were followed through on. Over the four years, I underwent several surgeries and numerous procedures but if I had a question and called or emailed Mr. Phelps he would always respond back within a few hours. I am very grateful for Mr. Phelps attentive advice and support he provided to our family during this lengthy process. He was able to negotiate the maximum award amount for my injury which has helped greatly.  If you get injured at work, don't hesitate, give Dennis Phelps a call. He is very professional and will get you the correct medical treatment and benefits you deserve along with the maximum settlement in the end!Rocky Wiechman LawMisty R. ratedThings didn't work out, but Rocky let us switch most of our retainer to another attorney, so that was nice. Overall communication was poor, and I never received an invoice with hours. Rocky didn't go see my brother (his client) in jail to let him know what was going on with his case until I called the office to let him go from our council. It was a whole week before Rocky spoke with his client. I thought that was odd, but maybe he is just too busy. In my opinion, don't take cases you don't have time for. I cannot say how he is with other clients. It was a hassle to get a hold of Rocky too, he never answered, is never in the office, and never replied to my emails. He made my family and I feel like we were bothering him. I think that when you're paying for a job, you should be reassured about what's going on with a loved one, and you should never be made to feel like you are "bothering" the person you've contracted. Regardless, I am happy he was a decent person and gave back $1800 of the $2500 retainer we put down, even though he didn't speak to my brother (his client) once about his case the whole month and a half we had contracted him. Cummings Nika A Jbfulton85 ratedI was having a tough time last year after losing my job, and ended up being charged with dui afterdeciding to drive to see a girl after hanging downtown. I thought I was fine (I only had a couple drinks), but ended up being pulled over (I blew .08 - give me a break). I had to spend the whole night in jail with people that were absolutely hammered – a homeless guy literally puked. Since I'd been looking for a new job, the last thing I needed was a dui on my record. A friend recommended Bill, so I set up a meeting. It didn't cost anything to just go talk to him, which I really liked since it took the initial pressure off. I don't know if I would have been as likely to go if I knew it was going to cost me. I had to give up my license for a month instead of a year and he got me a diversion so my record stayed clean). My bill was about half of what I was led to expect (from my friend) – so I don't know if my case went more smoothly or he's just gotten quicker/better. All in all, thanks to Bill, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be (minus the night in jail with that disgusting homeless guy).Lazzo, Markhannabanana4217 ratedI really tried my hardest to avoid filing bankruptcy (I spent more on my credit cards than I should have in college, expecting the job market to improve later when I graduated) but had to seek help when I finally realized I was in over my head. I guess I chose Mr. Lazzo because his office is closer to where I live than most of the attorneys in town (and I didn't want to have to mess with frequently commuting downtown). I don't think I was in as much debt as many that decide to go the bankruptcy route, but I needed help nonetheless. He handled everything extremely well, and now I can finally start over. I'm very glad I chose Mark. Law Office Of Tammy MartinCheryl J. ratedI have seen Tammy twice, the first time nearly 20 years ago and again just this week. She was, both times, very helpful, knowledgeable, courteous and friendly, caring, efficient, timely with services needed, and fees for services rendered were extremely reasonable. She met with me and my two witnesses at a nursing home so my brother did not have to leave his room to sign the forms needed. Both episodes of services needed were absolutely positive and I would not hesitate one second to seek further legal help from Tammy Martin. Thank you, again, Tammy!Arif Haeri LLP Law OfficesGayle S. ratedI know of five people that have used this attorney for their bankruptcies. & I plan to use them as well. They have all had very positive experiences. The attorney is very helpful in regard to payment arrangements and he is very aggressive with creditors who try to collect after the bankruptcy has been discharged. He is the only bankruptcy attorney I will recommend to others.Joseph Hollander & CraftWichita W. ratedThese are some of the most talented attorneys in Wichita and handle most of the big cases in the area as well. I have personally used their services several times for a few different issues and could not be happier. The divorce and dui defense teams are no joke.

She is not someone who requires follow-up phone calls and that is greatly appreciated.  She is very experienced in family law.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
