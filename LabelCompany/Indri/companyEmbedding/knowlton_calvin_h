January 14, 2015Award is Highest Honor in Pharmacy WASHINGTON, DC – Calvin H. Knowlton, BSPharm, MDiv, PhD, of Moorestown, NJ, is the recipient of the 2015 Remington Honor Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). Knowlton was selected in recognition of the professional achievements, innovations and advancements he has contributed to the pharmacy profession.
Knowlton is currently the founder and CEO of Tabula Rasa Healthcare, Inc., the parent company of CareKinesis, Inc., the tenth company founded in his illustrious career. A few of Knowlton’s professional accomplishments include: founding Hospice Pharmacia/excelleRx, a medication management and distribution company employing over 750 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and other staff, focused on providing palliative care; tackling medication management for the Programs of All-inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE) model of care; and developing a medication risk mitigation model operationalized through EireneRx, a cloud-based system that allows pharmacists to work with health care providers in optimizing drug therapies.
The Remington Honor Medal, named for eminent community pharmacist, manufacturer and educator Joseph P. Remington, was established in 1918 to recognize distinguished service on behalf of American pharmacy during the preceding years, culminating in the past year or during a long period of outstanding activity or fruitful achievement. Knowlton will be officially recognized during the APhA Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, March 27-30, 2015. The APhA awards and honors program is the most comprehensive recognition program in the profession of pharmacy.
A colleague’s nomination letter stated, “thanks to the “out of the box” thinking of Dr. Knowlton, almost half the Americans who passed away in the last two decades received care from Hospice Pharmacia/excelleRx, reaping the benefits of expert pharmacopalliation. In this practice model, pharmacists work in a transdisciplinary environment with nurses, physicians and other hospice and palliative care practitioners to select drug therapies that optimize clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. Dr. Knowlton developed a practice model that advanced the role of pharmacists to an unparalleled level, allowing thousands and thousands of patients to reach the end of the road with comfort and dignity. His efforts single-handedly elevated the level of prescribing practices for these incredibly complex patients. Although Dr. Knowlton moved on to other ventures, this company still exists today, using the model Dr. Knowlton developed almost two decades ago.”
Another nominator commented, “If you know Cal at all, then you know about his passion to advance the role of pharmacists in optimizing the care of patients who are at risk of harm from medications; and there is no more vulnerable population than PACE enrollees. Starting with this extremely high-risk group, he is a man on a mission to make a measurable impact on the abysmal epidemic of iatrogenesis in the US (third leading cause of death), of which a large proportion is due to medications. Accomplishing this mission elevates pharmacy as not only a major player in reducing medication misadventures, but also the player with the best tools to do the job.”
Knowlton has won numerous awards for his leadership in pharmacy, business and philanthropy in his career, including the unique distinction of winning both the 2003 and the 2013 Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Greater Philadelphia Region. He previously served as President of the American College of Apothecaries, President of the American Pharmacists Association, and President of the American Pharmacists Association Foundation. He currently serves on the Board of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, the Board of Coriell Life Sciences, the Board of the Evergreens Retirement Communities, and as a founding Board member of the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University. He recently finished his terms on the Board of St Christopher’s Hospital for Children and the Settlement Music School, both in Philadelphia.
An additional colleague mentioned, “What catches one’s eye is Cal’s passionate desire to advocate for our patients in the complex health care and medication use systems they face. The desire to do well, by doing good for others, has driven Cal to deliver enormous levels of creative solutions to patient care challenges in some of the most demanding areas of health care. His work in hospice care and care of the frail elderly now are but two examples of his highly innovative work. Other areas which differentiate Cal are his ability to create and embrace change, take the risks necessary to achieve lofty goals and the genius knack to communicate complex ideas and lead others to embrace them.”
Knowlton received his pharmacy degree from Temple University, his Divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary, and his PhD in pharmacoeconomics from the University of Maryland. He served as Professor and Department Chair for the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia in the 1990s. He has authored a textbook, various book chapters, numerous articles and has given hundreds of presentations.

CareKinesis CEO Calvin H. Knowlton Named E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year
News0


Moorestown, NJ, June 21, 2013 – CareKinesis Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Calvin H. Knowlton, BscPharm, MDiv, PhD, received the Greater Philadelphia Region’s most prestigious business award at a gala celebration held June 20, 2013 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.  The 2013 E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year award was presented to Dr. Knowlton for his “passion, vision and achievement”.
According to a statement released by E& Y, “the honorees not only create and build market –leading businesses, they also help take the standard of excellence to new heights, transfer the face of their industry, create jobs and contribute to the vibrancy of communities.” Dr. Knowlton and his team at CareKinesis met all those criteria to win the award.
Dr. Knowlton founded CareKinesis to promote medication safety and the application of the science of personalized medicine, including pharmacogenomics, through the use of advanced technology.  He and his team of expert pharmacy clinicians have developed a system for medication risk mitigation in the elderly that prioritizes medication safety, medication adherence, and information transparency to help clients reduce medication mis-adventuring and avoid preventable hospitalizations.
“I am delighted to receive this award on behalf of my colleagues at CareKinesis,” said Knowlton.  “Together, we have proven that involvement of specialized geriatric clinical pharmacists in prescribing decisions, administration regimens and patient follow-up results in better health outcomes for patients.”
Founded in 2009, CareKinesis partners with healthcare organizations such as PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) to provide personalized medication therapy management and pharmacy services for high-risk populations. The results are enhanced medication-related outcomes and greater operational efficiency.
PACE organizations nationwide rely on CareKinesis to increase medication adherence and reduce participant hospitalizations and recidivism. CareKinesis accomplishes this through real-time, clinical pharmacist medication management services, a proprietary electronic medication platform, adherence packaging choices and flexible medication access options.   Medication risk mitigation is a focus of 2013 service offerings. According to Knowlton, “The CareKinesis vision is to improve lives by optimizing the medication use process.”
“Cal Knowlton is a serial entrepreneur in the healthcare arena,” said Dianne Semingson, president of DLS International and consultant to CareKinesis. “He is a leader with a vision who inspires others to achieve. He attracts people who are uniquely qualified to take a business to the next level. He is passionate about doing good while doing well.”
In addition to numerous other awards, this is the second time Dr. Knowlton has won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award; he also received the honor in 2003.
He currently serves on the Board of Trustees, Coriell Institute for Medicine, Camden, NJ; Cooper Medical School of Rowan University Board of Directors, Camden, NJ and Board of Elders, First Presbyterian Church, Moorestown, NJ. He is a former member of St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children and Settlement School of Music in Philadelphia, PA.
Widely published, Dr. Knowlton is the author and co-author of numerous books, book chapters and articles, including the text book Pharmaceutical Care, published in 2003 now in its second edition.
Dr. Knowlton received a BS from Temple University, Masters in Divinity from Princeton University, and PhD in Pharmacoeconomics from the University of Maryland.

 Take Five with Calvin H. Knowlton
September 8, 2016  


Calvin Knowlton, BScPharm, MDiv, PhD, is the Founder and CEO of Tabula Rasa HealthCare, based in Moorestown.
At Tabula Rasa HealthCare, you focus on ways to use technology to improve health care, particularly in the area of medication risk mitigation. How big a problem is this?
 The elephant in the room in pharmacy is adverse drug events. CMS and the CDC have data showing that adverse drug events lead to more than 100,000 deaths each year. The problem worsens as people, many of them elderly, take five, six, ten or even 15 medications a day. And often these medications have been prescribed by more than one physician. The risk for complications can be high.  We have to solve this problem.
So what does Tabula Rasa do for these patients? 
 We have proprietary, technology-enabled products and services for medication management and risk adjustment.  Many pharmacists today use software that is decades old. The pharmacist can check for interactions only between one drug and one other drug. At TRHC, we can analyze how multiple drugs work together and how together they can cause problems. We can assess multi-medication prescribing. We can also use an individual’s genetic profile for insight into how he or she would metabolize certain medications.
What are the adverse reactions you are looking for?
We may look at the combined sedative effect. Or the combined dryness effect. Sometimes the patient will complain about dry mouth and the doctor may prescribe another medication to combat dryness without examining how the patient’s prescriptions may contribute to the problem. Medications that contribute to dryness may have serious health consequences for patients, impacting cognitive ability and, often, contributing to falls and hospitalizations.  We try to get to the root of medication-related problems and work as advisors to the prescribers.
You also can create genomic profiles for patients. How does that help in combating adverse drug events?
When the body takes in a medication, it is like a poison the body must water solubilize, or make water-soluble. The drug with the highest affinity for a gene will be water solubilized first and the other medications will circulate around the body, perhaps creating an unintentional overdose. Something as simple as changing the time of day a person takes a particular medication can make a big difference. Or maybe you can switch to another class of medication that does not use that particular enzyme. It is all very complex. In most cases, our platform will assume a patient has a normal gene profile. In the highest risk patients, however, a cheek swab test will show us their specific DNA, as it relates to drug metabolism. This DNA test allows us to assess medication activation and metabolism at a much more precise level. We have teams of scientists, clinical pharmacists and software developers working on how to uncover and then mitigate the risk.
The focus in health care today is often on improving care while also reducing costs. Is that the case with Tabula Rasa?
 Yes, absolutely. Sometimes we can reduce how many medications the patient is taking. But we also can reduce costs by improving care for the patient. Often there is no quarterback overseeing a patient’s entire medication regimen. The gastroenterologist may not want to change a medication prescribed by a psychiatrist, say, or by a neurologist. We know that by applying a novel, science-based approach to the medication-use process, we can help reduce ER visits, falls and hospitalizations. A patient with better care costs less. We think in several years that our software will be in every pharmacy school in the nation. What we are doing is part of the migration toward patient centricity in health care.
