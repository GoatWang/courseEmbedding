"Your Partners In Financial Success"
BKS is an independent investment management firm that offers full service financial solutions to families, foundations and small businesses. BKS uses asset allocation to design investment portfolios that match each clients risk and return expectations. Once developed, we actively manage these portfolios using a customized and unique blend of exchange traded funds, and/or individual stocks and bonds. Through strategic alliances with professional Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), estate and trust planning attorneys and insurance specialists, BKS assists clients with their tax planning, estate planning, and insurance needs. We are compensated on an asset-based scale, tied directly to the value of your portfolio, rather than on individual transactions.
From our site you can gather current quotes and news on individual stocks and funds, track your own personal portfolio, and send us any messages and or questions. Here you can stay up-to-date on relevant financial topics through our On-line Newsletter. Thanks for being here! We appreciate your visit. 

What makes us different?
BKS Advisors was founded as an Independent Registered Investment Advisor.  Our principles have over 50 years of combined experience providing professional investment guidance to financially successful individuals.  Our specialty is investment management; we also provide customized solutions to our clients that have other specific needs.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.
