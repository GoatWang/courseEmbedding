Job Details
               Baerlocher USA LLC is committed to the consistent manufacture and timely delivery of products which meet customer, internal and regulatory requirements. We strive to continually improve our quality processes. In order to achieve our quality objectives Baerlocher USA implemented and utilizes a Quality Management System conforming to ISO 9001:2008. Baerlocher USA is HACCP Certified in order to ensure the food packaging safety of the materials we produce. HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis (HA) and Critical Control Points (CCP). HACCP is a preventive approach to safeguard the consumer by minimizing significant health hazards in food. The definition and application of HACCP is a broad program aimed at ensuring food safety. Packaging materials are a subset of the primary program. HACCP is based upon the Codex Alimentarius and EU Regulation 852/2004. Under HACCP certification the discovery and monitoring of critical points along with the steps to be taken in the event of nonconformance to established limits is required. In Cincinnati we produce some products (Baeropols) that are utilized by our customers to develop food packaging. Our goal is to manufacture these products under a system of controls so that, under normal and foreseeable conditions, no substances are transferred to food in amounts that could endanger human health. Baeropol blends must meet food contact requirements based upon Policy 1935/2004 EC, FDA Regulations and Specific Requirements of Directive 2023/2006 EC. REACH is the new European Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. Having entered into force on 1st June 2007, it streamlines and improves the former legislative framework on chemicals of the European Union (EU). The main aims of REACH are to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals. Furthermore REACH enhances the promotion of alternative test methods, the free circulation of substances on the internal market and fosters competitiveness and innovation. REACH makes industry responsible for assessing and managing the risks posed by chemicals and providing appropriate safety information to their users. In parallel, the European Union can take additional measures on highly dangerous substances, where there is a need for complementing action at EU level.
