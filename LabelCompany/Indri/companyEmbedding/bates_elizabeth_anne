Hi. My direct Bates line on my father's side is:William James Bates & Sarah SymentonGeorge Bates and Elizabeth MorrowGeorge Leslie Bates & Eleanor Amelia CrawfordAlvin Ray Bates and Mildred Isabel YoungOn my mother's side :James Bates ( 1807) and Ann Parks ( who later married John Christy Frederick Kohn, July 25, 1858 and then I  lose track of her)Thomas Bates & Elizabeth Anne Hennessy ( who die in Alpena or Houghton, Michigan)Mary Jane Bates & William YoungRobbie Young & Jennie McRaeMildred Isabel Young & Alvin Ray BatesThere seem to be too many Bates names on the censuses and I am not sure how they are connected and it is considered that there were the two Bates families in Avoca in the beginning and I don't have a connection yet.Everyone  seems to consider that James Bates born in 1771 in Tyrone, Ireland is the father of :John m. Euphemia RobinsonGeorge m. Nancy Ann CampbellSarah Jane m. Jonathon KellyWilliam James m. Sarah Symenton but the following names are also on the same cenusesRobert Bates m. Elizabeth Mellon (Melon)Mary Bates b. 1801James Bates Jr. b. 1806 m. Elizabeth Smith ( they seem to go to East Hawkesbury)The other James Bates & Ann Parks have the following familyWilliam b. 1831 - IrelandThomas b. 1833 - Ireland m. Elizabeth Anne Hennessy b.1835Isabella b. 1837 - IrelandRachel b. 1839 - CanadaElizabeth b. 1843 - CanadaAnn b. 1845 - CanadaJohn Alexander b. Aug. 5, 1850 - Avoca m. Mary Jane BeavenRobert James b. 1852A lot of this family goes to the Arundel area or to Michigan where I lose track of them.The question is just who are the actual brothers and sisters and who is James Bates b. 1771 father of.  I think there may have been assumptions because of the places of burial and sure would like to sort out the actual relationships.I see that I have dates and places missing in your husband's family line and as I have about 30,000 names in my file perhaps I can fill in your gaps. Please tell me how I can help. I may have a copy of the original land patent on John's property. I have quite a few and I do have a list of all the land patents in Avoca so could at least provide the document number and address to write for a copy.
