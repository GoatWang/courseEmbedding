Nomination Form




Joe W. ForehandTrusted Mentor for World’s Largest Global ConsultancyInducted in 2002Joe W. Forehand has remained with one company throughout his nearly 30-year career, yet change is his guiding principle. The Alexander City native is chairman and CEO of Accenture, the world’s leading provider of management and technology consulting services and solutions, with net revenues of $11.44 billion last year and more than 75,000 employees and offices in 46 countries. Mr. Forehand is Consulting Magazine’s Most Influential Consultant and was named by InformationWeek one of 15 most inspirational figures in information technology. His entrepreneurial vision drove one of the largest rebranding efforts ever undertaken, as Accenture won its legal separation after an arbitration process.
Mr. Forehand joined the company in 1972 in Atlanta. On his way to becoming a partner in 1982, he worked in the Products group with a broad mix of manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and transportation organizations. Eventually he led the Atlanta Products group, and then in 1994 he was named the head of the company’s Americas Products group.
In 1997, Mr. Forehand became managing partner for the Products global market unit, splitting his time between offices in Dallas and Paris. A year later, he was named managing partner for the Communications & High Tech global market unit. His expertise ranges from sales to manufacturing to enterprise financial systems. Additionally, he has proven insight into a range of digital industries, including media
and entertainment companies, communications, electronics, and high tech firms, placing him at the forefront of Accenture’s leading e-commerce work. In all, Mr. Forehand has held leadership positions in 11 of Accenture’s 18 industry practices, experience that helps explain the collaborative spirit and inclusive management practices for which he is acclaimed.
Well respected by Accenture’s Fortune 500 clients around the world, Mr. Forehand also commands the trust of 2,500 Accenture partners, due in part to his powerful analytical skills and pragmatic approaches, grounded in an engineering mindset. Under his leadership, the partners undertook a historic vote to pursue an initial public offering for Accenture. While “growing” the company in this and a
host of other ways, he never lost sight of the social mission of a major company: Accenture is a generous supporter of higher education and civic programs.
Mr. Forehand carries influence far beyond Accenture. He participates annually at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an organization committed to improving people’s lives by furthering economic growth and social progress. He serves on the Busi-ness Steering Committee of the Global Business Dialogue on E-Commerce, and he is a member of the Business Coalition for Excellence in Education, a national group seeking education reforms. He frequently addresses business conferences and he recently gave keynote addresses at the Microsoft Information Management 2001 Conference and the 2001 Hewlett-Packard Latin America e-Government & IT Conference.
Mr. Forehand is a 1971 graduate of Auburn University’s industrial engineering program and a 1972 graduate of Purdue University’s industrial administration program. Mr. Forehand is a member of the Dean’s Club at Auburn and the President’s Club at Purdue University. He also is former chair of the Auburn University Industrial Engineering Alumni Advisory Committee. He has been named Alumnus of the Year by Auburn’s industrial engineering department and also received the Auburn Engineering Alumni Council’s Distinguished Engineer Award.
Mr. Forehand and his wife, Gayle, have been married for more than 30 years, raised twin sons and now reside in Plano, Texas.

		/ About Joe W. Forehand
About Joe W. ForehandJoe W. Forehand ended his 34 year career with Accenture in 2006 as the company’s Chairman. In this role, in addition to chairing the board of directors, Mr. Forehand provided input into Accenture’s business strategy and helped build strong relationships with Accenture’s clients as well as with business and government leaders.
Mr. Forehand served as Accenture’s CEO from November 1999 through August 2004, leading Accenture through a period of significant change and growth. In August 2000, Mr. Forehand orchestrated the successful conclusion of the company’s arbitration process with Andersen Worldwide. Shortly thereafter, the company changed its name to Accenture and undertook one of the largest global rebranding campaigns of its kind in record time. In July 2001 Mr. Forehand led the company in its IPO, one of the largest in US history. Mr. Forehand has also overseen the company’s strategic change initiative, moving Accenture from a conventional consulting model to a focus on business consulting, technology leadership and outsourcing.
During Mr. Forehand’s term as CEO, Accenture grew from $9.6 billion in revenue and 66,000 employees to $13.7 billion in revenue and 103,000 employees. As a public company under his leadership, Accenture’s total return to shareholders was 74 percent at a time when the S&P 100 Index decreased 14 percent. Accenture’s fiscal year 2004 return on invested capital would rank No. 1 relative to the S&P 100 companies.
Mr. Forehand joined the company in 1972 in the Atlanta office and became a partner 10 years later. He was named Accenture’s CEO in November 1999 and chairman of the board of directors in February 2001. Immediately prior to becoming CEO, he led Accenture’s Communications & High Tech operating group.
Mr. Forehand has received many honors for his visionary leadership. Among them are the Carl S. Sloane Award for Excellence in Management Consulting and the Morgan Stanley Leadership Award for Global Commerce, sponsored by the Computerworld Honors Program. Mr. Forehand was also named as a distinguished alumnus by the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering at Auburn University and was elected to the State of Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame.
Raised in Alexander City, Alabama, Mr. Forehand graduated from Auburn University in 1971 with a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering. He received a Master of Science degree in industrial administration from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University in 1972. Mr. Forehand also holds an honorary doctorate of management from Purdue University. He and his wife have two sons.Last Updated:
