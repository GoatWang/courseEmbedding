Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]
In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,[4] and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.[8] In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.[9] In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world.[4]
In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.[10]
Personal life[edit]
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,[5] a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.[6] In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.[11][12] In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[13] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735.[3][14]
In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]
Bacon has been involved in litigation with Peter Nygard, founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard harming the environment around Clifton Bay, Bahamas, where both have compounds in Lyford Cay. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation. Suits have been filed in the Bahamas and New York.[17]
Political and economic views[edit]
Bacon contributed £250,000 to Britain's Conservative Party.[18] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney.[19] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.[20]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list.[21]
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[22] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper.[23][24]
In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area.[25]
Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca – thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land.[26]
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:

Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[27]
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[28][29]
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.

Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Seth Klarman, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[30]
He is the 2013 recipient of the Audubon Medal, given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection.[31]

Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]
In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,[4] and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.[8] In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.[9] In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world.[4]
In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.[10]
Personal life[edit]
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,[5] a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.[6] In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.[11][12] In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[13] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735.[3][14]
In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]
Bacon has been involved in litigation with Peter Nygard, founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard harming the environment around Clifton Bay, Bahamas, where both have compounds in Lyford Cay. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation. Suits have been filed in the Bahamas and New York.[17]
Political and economic views[edit]
Bacon contributed £250,000 to Britain's Conservative Party.[18] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney.[19] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.[20]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list.[21]
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[22] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper.[23][24]
In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area.[25]
Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca – thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land.[26]
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:

Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[27]
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[28][29]
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.

Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Seth Klarman, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]
In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,[4] and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.[8] In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.[9] In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world.[4]
In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.[10]
Personal life[edit]
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,[5] a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.[6] In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.[11][12] In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[13] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735.[3][14]
In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]
Bacon has been involved in litigation with Peter Nygard, founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard harming the environment around Clifton Bay, Bahamas, where both have compounds in Lyford Cay. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation. Suits have been filed in the Bahamas and New York.[17]
Political and economic views[edit]
Bacon contributed £250,000 to Britain's Conservative Party.[18] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney.[19] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.[20]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list.[21]
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[22] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper.[23][24]
In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area.[25]
Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca – thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land.[26]
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:

Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[27]
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[28][29]
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.

Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Seth Klarman, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[30]
He is the 2013 recipient of the Audubon Medal, given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection.[31]

Rural North Carolina: An International Battleground on Forests and Climate Change



by Danna Smith, Founder and Executive Director, Dogwood Alliance Category: Environmental Justice, Forest Health Management, North Carolina

Today, most people understand that transitioning away from fossil fuels toward clean energy is essential to solving the climate crisis. Despite the fact that the Trump administration pulled out of the historic Paris Agreement, it’s been inspiring to see the flurry of activity on the part of states, municipalities and corporations across the nation committed to ensuring the U.S. does its part to meet the ambitious goals by committing to transition toward 100 percent clean energy. While this is certainly encouraging, we must face a harsh reality. Essential, getting off fossil fuels won’t be enough. Every scientific model I have seen proposing pathways to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius includes both a rapid reduction in carbon emissions and a dramatic increase in the amount of carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere. Standing natural forests are the only proven system that can operate at the scale necessary to remove enough carbon from the atmosphere within the timeframe necessary to avoid climate catastrophe. Equally as important, standing forests provide a safety net that can mitigate the effects... read more +

Why the ocean is everybody’s business



by Clare John, Ocean Unite Category: Ocean Preservation

The ocean sustains life on earth. It provides half the oxygen we breathe, has absorbed a quarter of our carbon emissions, supports the livelihoods of over three billion people and puts food on our plates. But the ocean is in trouble. There’s more plastic in the ocean than ever before – by 2050 it’s predicted there will be more plastic than fish! Pollution is causing ‘dead zones’, climate change is warming the ocean making it increasingly acidic, overfishing is putting species dangerously at risk and ecosystems are being pushed beyond their limit. Despite covering 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface, only three per cent of the ocean is currently under some form of protection, and much of the remaining 97 per cent suffers from poor management. There is also so much we still don’t know – the ocean is probably the least understood and most biologically diverse of all of Earth’s ecosystems with millions of species yet to be discovered. But it’s not too late. We can change the tide. The ocean is incredibly resilient and it... read more +

The Value Of Keeping Sharks Alive



by Co-authored by Andrew Sharpless, Oceana's Chief Executive Officer and Louis Bacon, Chief Executive Officer of Moore Capital Management and Founder and chairman of The Moore Charitable Foundation Category: Ocean Preservation, Sharks

How much is a shark worth? That might sound like a strange question. To conservationists, biologists or people who love the ocean, it might be impossible to quantify the value of such a magnificent creature. For fishers around the world, the answer is probably more straightforward. But one thing is now clear: sharks are worth much more alive than dead in the state of Florida. A new, independent report commissioned by Oceana found that live sharks provide significant economic benefits to the state of Florida. Divers and tourists travel from around the world to see sharks in person, supporting a tourism industry that depends on healthy animals. Given the global threats to survival of sharks and the key roles they play both in nature and in some coastal economies, the report commissioned by Oceana, and research by others, highlights the need for Congress to pass the proposed Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act to enact a nationwide ban on the trade of shark fins. The bill, introduced by Reps. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and Gregorio Sablan (I-MP), would remove the... read more +

Working to Protect North Carolina’s Communities and Waters from Industrial Animal Agriculture Pollution



by Geoff Gisler, Senior Attorney, The Southern Environmental Center Category: Environmental Justice

Spring is in the air in North Carolina. For many of us, that means opening our windows to let the fresh air in, playing with our kids in the yard, or sitting back and relaxing in a rocking chair on the front porch. For North Carolinians who live near industrial hog operations, however, these rites of Spring are distant memories. The coastal plain of North Carolina is littered with industrial hog facilities—concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in the legal terminology. The state is second to only Iowa in annual pork production. Thousands of CAFOs are concentrated in eastern North Carolina, with the greatest densities in Duplin and Sampson counties. Each of these facilities hosts hundreds or even thousands of hogs, which are typically brought in to the facility as piglets and kept on site until they reach slaughter weight. After the hogs are taken away, their waste is left behind. It’s that waste that haunts nearby communities, which are disproportionately low-income communities of color. The waste from the hogs is collected and stored in unlined, open-air storage pits... read more +

When Forests Burn, It’s Good for Wildlife and Local Communities



by Jay Jensen, Southern Region Director, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Category: North Carolina

Southern forests were once covered by the longleaf pine — over 90 million acres of it! Longleaf was the dominant forest type for the coastal plain, and hundreds of plants and animals evolved and thrived within the open, park-like stands that characterize longleaf pine habitat. By the mid-20th Century, that acreage was down to just 3.5 million acres, partially due to a lack of regular fire, which is critical to maintaining the habitat conditions favored by plants and wildlife unique to this ecosystem. But recently, thanks to hard-fought collaborative conservation efforts, the longleaf range has begun to expand again, reaching nearly five million acres. Unfortunately, the decline in the acreage and the quality of longleaf forests has translated into a similar decline for the plants and animals that depend on healthy longleaf habitat, sending many of these species to the emergency triage room that is the Endangered Species Act. But there is a plan to reverse this troubling trend: fire. In North Carolina, getting more fire in the longleaf pine ecosystem is at the heart of a new... read more +

Becoming the World’s First Ski Resort B Corporation



by David Norden, CEO, Taos Ski Valley Category: Taos

Skiing has long been a recreation of choice for those who take inspiration from nature. After all, it’s one of the few activities where an ordinary person can find himself two miles above sea level, looking out at hundreds of miles of snowcapped mountain peaks and a spectacular array of natural elements that are so vital to our lives: water, trees, wildlife, sun and wind. Unfortunately, as the ski industry grew over the last few decades, conservationists began pointing out the harm the industry was causing to its surroundings. From an over-reliance on fossil fuels, to employment practices that weren’t always fair to workers and radically distort local economies, the ski industry has received its fair share of public outcry, particularly among the conservation- and social justice-minded. The industry has answered these accusations through a series of approaches, pursuing energy and water efficiency measures and renewable energy sources, working with legislators to enact legislation to address climate change, creatively seeking solutions to employee housing issues, or reducing waste in streams and implementing recycling programs. These have legitimately addressed... read more +

Let’s Prove that Americans Don’t Want Shark Fins in The U.S.



by Lora Snyder, Campaign Director, Oceana Category: Blue Economy, Sharks

When most people think of the devastating global trade of animal products, they probably think of elephant tusks or rhino horns – the demand for which has devastated these populations in recent decades. However, with many countries around the world, including the United States, now banning these products, these animals have been given a second chance to recover and thrive. Most Americans do not know though that the U.S. still participates in a global trade that is decimating animal populations around the world: shark fins. It’s estimated the fins from as many as 73 million sharks end up in the global fin trade every year, mainly as an ingredient in the Asian dish shark fin soup. This demand for fins is severely jeopardizing the survival of certain shark populations around the world and can lead to the brutal practice of shark finning – when a fisherman cuts the fins off of a shark and throws the body back overboard, usually to drown, bleed to death or to be eaten alive. Although shark finning has been illegal in U.S. waters... read more +

A River Worth the Fight: Visualizing a Healthy, Connected and Respected Cape Fear



by Kemp Burdette, Cape Fear Riverkeeper Category: North Carolina

The Cape Fear River is North Carolina’s largest and most diverse river, the only river in the state to empty directly into the Atlantic Ocean, and the drinking water supply for one in five North Carolinians. For the river and the people who live along it 2016 was marked with both major victories and ongoing challenges. Already in 2017, many river guardians are working hard to secure more of the former, and mitigate more of the latter. I know the following to be true, as do conservation philanthropist Louis Bacon and The Orton Foundation: this river is worth the fight. An introduction to its specific geography, history and romance can be found in Our State’s story of my eight-day 203-mile paddle from source to mouth. We hope the photos of our trip, maps and videos will inspire you as you learn about its threats and visualize a healthy future.

Environmental Justice in Colorado’s Conejos Land Grant Region



by Justin Garoutte, Executive Director of Conejos Clean Water Category: Colorado, Environmental Justice, Land Conservation

Louis Bacon and The Trinchera Blanca Foundation, an affiliate of  The Moore Charitable Foundation are proud to partner with Conejos Clean Water. It’s another morning in southern Colorado’s Conejos Land Grant Region, a region that has seen more sweat and tears than I will ever know, a region with so much promise, resiliency and aspirations for a brighter future. I walk the aching streets of Antonito, and the warm Colorado sun spreads its blessings upon the adobe houses, houses that were once homes, some that still are, holding on in a town whose heart beats slow and steady for its people, our culture and the land, air and water that give us life. If you walk around town long enough, you’ll eventually find Conejos Clean Water, a grassroots organization, now it its seventh year. Conejos Clean Water came about in 2010 though a struggle for environmental justice when radioactive, hazardous nuclear waste was to be transferred at a site just south of town, right next to the San Antonio River that provides life for our people. We won that... read more +

A Victorious Year Against Offshore Drilling along East Coast – Thanks to a Grassroots Movement



by Claire Douglass, Campaign Director for Climate and Energy, Oceana Category: North Carolina

Last week, the Obama administration formally denied all pending seismic airgun blasting permits in the Atlantic, favoring local voices over oil interests in a move that goes against the grain of our historically fossil fuel dependent society and solidifies the path to a cleaner, more sustainable renewable energy future. Although in recent months groups have been making headway, the fight against offshore drilling and exploration in the Atlantic certainly started as a seemingly losing battle. In 2008, the Bush administration lifted a longstanding moratorium on offshore drilling in the Atlantic. Done quietly, most East Coast communities had no idea their waters were open to the prospect of offshore drilling, and up until 2014, the only people privy to proposed drilling plans were those who supported it. Virtually unopposed, the government proceeded with plans to open up the Atlantic to offshore drilling – plans that surely would have gone smoothly, except for one little hitch: people like you. In 2014, Oceana planted the seeds of a grassroots movement that would eventually sweep across the East Coast. It all started... read more +

Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]
In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,[4] and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.[8] In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.[9] In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world.[4]
In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.[10]
Personal life[edit]
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,[5] a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.[6] In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.[11][12] In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[13] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735.[3][14]
In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]
Bacon has been involved in litigation with Peter Nygard, founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard harming the environment around Clifton Bay, Bahamas, where both have compounds in Lyford Cay. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation. Suits have been filed in the Bahamas and New York.[17]
Political and economic views[edit]
Bacon contributed £250,000 to Britain's Conservative Party.[18] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney.[19] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.[20]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list.[21]
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[22] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper.[23][24]
In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area.[25]
Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca – thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land.[26]
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:

Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[27]
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[28][29]
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.

Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Seth Klarman, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[30]
He is the 2013 recipient of the Audubon Medal, given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection.[31]

Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]
In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,[4] and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.[8] In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.[9] In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world.[4]
In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.[10]
Personal life[edit]
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,[5] a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.[6] In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.[11][12] In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[13] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735.[3][14]
In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]
Bacon has been involved in litigation with Peter Nygard, founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard harming the environment around Clifton Bay, Bahamas, where both have compounds in Lyford Cay. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation. Suits have been filed in the Bahamas and New York.[17]
Political and economic views[edit]
Bacon contributed £250,000 to Britain's Conservative Party.[18] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney.[19] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.[20]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list.[21]
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[22] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper.[23][24]
In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area.[25]
Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca – thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land.[26]
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:

Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[27]
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[28][29]
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.

Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Seth Klarman, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[30]
He is the 2013 recipient of the Audubon Medal, given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection.[31]

Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]

In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]

Early life and education[edit]
Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial’s and Merrill Lynch’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.[3]
Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.[3][4] Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years.[3] He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981.[3][5]
While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.[6]
Investment career[edit]
After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a "runner".[3] Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.[3][5][7]
In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound.[3] In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.[3]
In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,[4] and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.[8] In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.[9] In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world.[4]
In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.[10]
Personal life[edit]
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,[5] a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.[6] In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.[11][12] In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The 171,400-acre (694 km2) property sold for $175 million.[13] In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735.[3][14]
In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post newspaper, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.[15][16]
Bacon has been involved in litigation with Peter Nygard, founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard harming the environment around Clifton Bay, Bahamas, where both have compounds in Lyford Cay. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation. Suits have been filed in the Bahamas and New York.[17]
Political and economic views[edit]
Bacon contributed £250,000 to Britain's Conservative Party.[18] Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney.[19] In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.[20]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list.[21]
In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems.[22] Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper.[23][24]
In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area.[25]
Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca – thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land.[26]
In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include:

Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the "Jewel of the Peconic" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years.[27]
Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon’s Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area’s habitat.[28][29]
Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.

Legacy and awards[edit]
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with David Swensen, Seth Klarman, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Jack Nash, James Simmons, Alfred Jones, Leon Levy, Julian Roberston, and Bruce Kovner.[30]
He is the 2013 recipient of the Audubon Medal, given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection.[31]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
