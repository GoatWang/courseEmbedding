      Biosimilar Indication Extrapolation
    





Although the FDA may approve a biosimilar for all of the indications
  of its reference product, the biosimilar’s manufacturer may have only
  conducted clinical trials for one or two representative indications.
  Extrapolation is an important concept for biosimilars. Hear Dr.
  Gregory Schimizzi clarify this concept. 






To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video



Key Takeaways 
 Indication extrapolation refers to a biosimilar being approved
    for indications that were not evaluated during the biosimilar’s
    clinical trials. Given the complexities of the science
    behind extrapolation, based on scientific justification, it may not
    be appropriate in all cases.  The FDA recommends that
    a biosimilar manufacturer choose a condition of use that would be
    adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences
    between the biosimilar and reference product.  In
    some cases, healthy volunteers may be the most sensitive population
    to study when seeking to reveal differences in immune responses, as
    healthy volunteers are not immunocompromised and, therefore, will
    exhibit normal immune responses.

      Biosimilars vs. Generics
    





Biosimilars are often confused with generic drugs—but they are not
  the same. Dr. Michael Morse explains the fundamental differences. One
  significant distinction? Unlike generics, the FDA requires a
  biosimilar to be highly similar, but not identical to the existing
  biologic medicine, which is referred to as a "reference
  product." Biologic medicines are large, complex molecules or
  mixtures of molecules that may be composed of living material. As
  such, biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference
  products.

Key Takeaways
 Biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference
    products.  Unlike generic drugs, which are chemically
    synthesized, biosimilars are grown in complex living systems. Given
    the complexity of this process, it's unlikely for biosimilars to be
    exact replicas. Biosimilars may be marked with an
    interchangeability designation, which means it meets additional
    standards and can be substituted for the reference product by a
    pharmacist, per state laws, without the intervention of the original
    prescriber.  Biosimilars are reviewed under the
    abbreviated FDA review process known as 351(k) pathway. The
    sponsor of a biosimilar demonstrates biosimilarity primarily from
    nonclinical analyses that examine the structure and functional
    nature of the biosimilar molecule. Per FDA guidance, the Agency
    reviews the totality of evidence in a stepwise approach and does not
    necessarily focus on one type of study to evaluate a sponsor’s
    application for demonstration of biosimilarity.

Overview
Home > About Us > Overview 





China Biologic Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBPO), is one of the largest non-state-owned fully integrated plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies in China. Our core capabilities include plasma collection, research and development, production, and commercialization of biopharmaceutical products.
We have a strong product portfolio with over 20 different dosage forms of plasma products in three major classes: human albumin, immunoglobulin （including IVIG, intramuscular immunoglobulin and hyperimmune products), and coagulation factor products. And we have new products under development to drive our future growth. We are constantly at work to enhance our research and development and technological capabilities to create new products and to improve our existing products and processes.
Our headquarters is based in the city of Beijing. We manufacture through our majority-owned subsidiaries, Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co.,Ltd and Guizhou Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd., and have a minority equity investment in Xi’an Huitian Blood Products Co.,Ltd. We also own one pharmaceutical distribution company, one pharmaceutical research center, and 12 captive plasma collection centers.
We sell directly to over 1,000 hospitals and inoculation centers in China and seek to reduce the use of independent distributors.
Our company was founded in 2002 and was listed on NASDAQ in 2009. Since 2009, we have been ranked three times as Asia’s “200 Best under a Billion” in the annual list compiled by Forbes Magazine.

Message from Our CEO



We began our journey in plasma products research and production began in 1971 with the foundation of the Shandong Institute of Biological Products (“Shandong Institute”). In 2002, we established a joint venture with Shandong Institute, which became our major operating subsidiary. Through a number of successful strategic acquisitions and investments over the past 10 years, China Biologic Products, Inc. has become one of the largest non-state-owned plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies in China, with two majority-owned operating subsidiaries and one minority investee. Since December 2009, we have been a NASDAQ-listed company under the trading symbol of “CBPO.” 
Today, through our two majority-owned operating facilities, we have 12 captive plasma collection centers located in Shandong, Guangxi and Guizhou. We are the second largest plasma collector in China in terms of 2012 collection volume with approximately 15% market share. Our plasma-based products, such as albumin and immunoglobulin for intravenous injection, are critical and essential in the treatment of medical emergencies and life-threatening diseases.
China’s plasma-based biopharmaceutical industry is in its infancy stage, and the plasma products market is still under-penetrated. Our expertise in the development and commercialization of plasma products has been the key driver for our success. We will continue to leverage our expertise to further solidify our market leadership. Building on our strong research and development position, we are committed to expanding our product portfolio and pipeline to include more technologically advanced, higher-margin products, many of which are used in the United States and other developed markets, but are not currently manufactured in China. 
Healthcare spending in China continues to increase, driven by an aging population, accelerated urbanization, increased government spending, and higher disposable household incomes. The rising demand for modern healthcare products and services is further fueled by the unprecedented $124 billion healthcare reform, which will provide, among other things, universal coverage to China’s population of 1.3 billion.  We expect our sales to grow as the demand rises for our current and future life-saving plasma-based products. 
Critical to our success is our team, consisting of over 1,500 dedicated full-time employees as of December 31, 2013, which is focused on the single goal of maintaining our leading position in the plasma-based biopharmaceutical industry in China. 
Whether you are an investor, employee, partner, or medical professional, I thank you for your interest in our company, and I invite you to learn more about us. We are confident about the potential for growth in China’s biopharmaceutical industry and look forward to delivering attractive results to our stakeholders in the years ahead.  
Sincerely yours,


David Gao

In July 2013, 110 employees at Guizhou Taibang participated in the voluntary whole-blood donation event, as part of the community effort to address the local blood shortage.

In November 2013, Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang each donated RMB 500,000 to the Beijing Medical Award Foundation, which is dedicated to awarding excellence in heathcare practice and research.
In 2013, Shandong Taibang donated 2,220 bottles of Human Coagulation Factor VIII with market value of approximately RMB 0.8 million to the Hemophilia Home of China (HHC) to support low-income hemophilia patients.














Since launching Human Coagulation Factor VIII (“Factor VIII”) in 2012, China Biologic Products, Inc. has built upon its partnership with the Hemophilia Home of China (“HHC”). As part of the expanded cooperation, the Company will donate Factor VIII products regularly and to help raise social awareness of the disease every year in conjunction with World Hemophilia Day on April 17.

      Biosimilar Indication Extrapolation
    





Although the FDA may approve a biosimilar for all of the indications
  of its reference product, the biosimilar’s manufacturer may have only
  conducted clinical trials for one or two representative indications.
  Extrapolation is an important concept for biosimilars. Hear Dr.
  Gregory Schimizzi clarify this concept. 






To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video



Key Takeaways 
 Indication extrapolation refers to a biosimilar being approved
    for indications that were not evaluated during the biosimilar’s
    clinical trials. Given the complexities of the science
    behind extrapolation, based on scientific justification, it may not
    be appropriate in all cases.  The FDA recommends that
    a biosimilar manufacturer choose a condition of use that would be
    adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences
    between the biosimilar and reference product.  In
    some cases, healthy volunteers may be the most sensitive population
    to study when seeking to reveal differences in immune responses, as
    healthy volunteers are not immunocompromised and, therefore, will
    exhibit normal immune responses.

      Biosimilars vs. Generics
    





Biosimilars are often confused with generic drugs—but they are not
  the same. Dr. Michael Morse explains the fundamental differences. One
  significant distinction? Unlike generics, the FDA requires a
  biosimilar to be highly similar, but not identical to the existing
  biologic medicine, which is referred to as a "reference
  product." Biologic medicines are large, complex molecules or
  mixtures of molecules that may be composed of living material. As
  such, biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference
  products.

Key Takeaways
 Biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference
    products.  Unlike generic drugs, which are chemically
    synthesized, biosimilars are grown in complex living systems. Given
    the complexity of this process, it's unlikely for biosimilars to be
    exact replicas. Biosimilars may be marked with an
    interchangeability designation, which means it meets additional
    standards and can be substituted for the reference product by a
    pharmacist, per state laws, without the intervention of the original
    prescriber.  Biosimilars are reviewed under the
    abbreviated FDA review process known as 351(k) pathway. The
    sponsor of a biosimilar demonstrates biosimilarity primarily from
    nonclinical analyses that examine the structure and functional
    nature of the biosimilar molecule. Per FDA guidance, the Agency
    reviews the totality of evidence in a stepwise approach and does not
    necessarily focus on one type of study to evaluate a sponsor’s
    application for demonstration of biosimilarity.

The menthol/lavender fragrance dissipates quickly as the China Gel Topical Pain Reliever is absorbed into the skin, eventually becoming odor-free.The makers of China-Gel use the following herbal ingredients:  menthol, camphor, ginseng extract, angelica extract, lavender oil, aloe vera, and witch hazel.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
