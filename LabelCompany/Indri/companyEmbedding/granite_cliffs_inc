Neighborhood - Bassett Creek








Bassett Creek






Bassett Creek is located in the southwest region of Crystal. The local passion for preserving and protecting the Bassett Creek waters and parkland give this neighborhood a unifying voice that distinguishes it from other parts of the city. With Minneapolis to the southeast, the neighborhood lies close enough to the city to feel metropolitan but, as the active Bassett Creek Park Group reminds residents, the neighborhood is still small enough to bond together. Folks looking for a cheerful and comfortable home with urban access should look no further.

The change to a smoke-free environment was wonderful.  The lack of enough recycling and garbage containers (They overfill and then the trash gets blown around the property)could be improved.  It seems like they take care of the property.  Not sure if we have a full-time on site manager yet who will accept packages.

An Administrative Law Judge has issued an Initial Decision of Default as to Granite Cliffs Inc. The Initial Decision found that the company was issuer of securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and the company failed to comply with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 by not filing required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Initial Decision finds these allegations to be true and revokes the registration of each class of the company’s registered securities, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The judge in the proceeding will then determine whether the registrations pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 of each class of the securities of the company should be revoked or suspended for a period not exceeding twelve months.

Neighborhood - Bassett Creek








Bassett Creek






Bassett Creek is located in the southwest region of Crystal. The local passion for preserving and protecting the Bassett Creek waters and parkland give this neighborhood a unifying voice that distinguishes it from other parts of the city. With Minneapolis to the southeast, the neighborhood lies close enough to the city to feel metropolitan but, as the active Bassett Creek Park Group reminds residents, the neighborhood is still small enough to bond together. Folks looking for a cheerful and comfortable home with urban access should look no further.

The change to a smoke-free environment was wonderful.  The lack of enough recycling and garbage containers (They overfill and then the trash gets blown around the property)could be improved.  It seems like they take care of the property.  Not sure if we have a full-time on site manager yet who will accept packages.  For those of us who work during delivery hours with no other arrangements available, this is an inconvenience.10-10-2014Was this helpful?

Properties may also conduct satisfaction surveys of its residents through other third party market research firms.  In those cases, we will publish those survey responses as long as the questions conform to our standard survey format.Because reviews are from Certified Residents, and are managed by a third party, you can feel confident that the feedback provided is accurate and trustworthy.Report AbuseAll reviews have been thoroughly reviewed before posting, however if you feel this review meets the following criteria we want to know.

Value Tip #1
                                Don't Pay for Watered Down Cleaner                            

Pine-Sol® Cleaners are concentrated formulas that you can dilute for most jobs. For general cleaning, a 24 oz. bottle gives you 12 gallons of cleaning power! Add water to the formula yourself and save.





Value Tip #2
                                One Cleaner, Many Uses                            

You could spend big bucks on different cleaners for your furniture, toilet, floors, counters and appliances. With Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaner, you only need one cleaner to fight dirt, grime and grease, and deodorize all of these surfaces throughout your home. Easy for you, and easy on your wallet.





Value Tip #3
                                Cleans and Deodorizes                            

No need for air fresheners, scented candles or deodorizing sprays: Pine-Sol® gives you both a great clean and a great smell. It gets your home spotless while leaving a refreshing scent that tells visitors you've been busy.





Value Tip #4
                                Pick the Right Strength for You                            

You can mix Pine-Sol® with water at different strengths for different household needs, unlike a premixed spray. You can tackle any challenge, adjusting your cleaning power each time.





Value Tip #5
                                No Special Tools                            

Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaner works with everything from rags, mops and brushes to microfiber cloths and paper towels. You don’t need to buy fancy new cleaning utensils or gadgets: you can use what you already have in your home.






Value Tip #6
                                One Time Around                            

With the power of Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaner on your side, you only have to clean once to get the job done right. No need to go back over your hard work, saving you time and energy.

Introduction
We would like to welcome you to Art in Stone, a place where a person is provided the rare opportunity to express their memories through the creation of a unique, highly personalized, everlasting memorial. From the moment you step into our facility, you will immediately understand what sets Art in Stone above the rest.

 About Artist

                    Soon after arriving to United States in the early 1980’s, Leon Rader founded Art in Stone, located in Colma California.                    Using the skills and secret methodologies he learned from masters throughout Europe, along with his natural artistic ability, Leon Rader introduced a new style of memorialization that has changed the cemetery landscape of Colma forever.Why Us?


While other companies advertise and praise themselves on being in business anywhere from 50-100 years, they forget to mention that their business were either handed down to them through the generations, or even worse, their businesses have changed ownership numerous times over. 

What does this mean to the client? 

It means that the artists that founded the companies are no longer there. At Art in Stone, Leon Rader, the original founder and master sculptor, owns and operates the business on a daily basis, overseeing each and every memorial that leaves our studio.

Neighborhood - Bassett Creek








Bassett Creek






Bassett Creek is located in the southwest region of Crystal. The local passion for preserving and protecting the Bassett Creek waters and parkland give this neighborhood a unifying voice that distinguishes it from other parts of the city. With Minneapolis to the southeast, the neighborhood lies close enough to the city to feel metropolitan but, as the active Bassett Creek Park Group reminds residents, the neighborhood is still small enough to bond together. Folks looking for a cheerful and comfortable home with urban access should look no further.

The change to a smoke-free environment was wonderful.  The lack of enough recycling and garbage containers (They overfill and then the trash gets blown around the property)could be improved.  It seems like they take care of the property.  Not sure if we have a full-time on site manager yet who will accept packages.  For those of us who work during delivery hours with no other arrangements available, this is an inconvenience.10-10-2014Was this helpful?
