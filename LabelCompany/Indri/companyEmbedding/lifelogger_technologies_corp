(OTCMKTS:LOGG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Lifelogger: No Market + No Product + Imminent Capital Raise = SellMay.12.15 | About: LifeLogger Technologies (LOGG) Weighing Machine Long/short equitySummaryInvestor interest in wearable cameras has caused a rise in Lifelogger's stock price. However, a failed Kickstarter campaign indicates a lack of consumer interest in Lifelogger's (potential) product.
        Lifelogger has continually missed product release targets over the past 18 months and appears to be behind on its current plan.
        Lifelogger spent just $118,000 on R&D and has no patents.
        Lifelogger is running out of cash - Auditors have issued a going concern clause expressing doubt about Lifelogger's ability to remain in business.
        The market currently values Lifelogger at over $40 million. With no product, minimal consumer interest, no patents, and a rapidly depleting cash balance, the author believes shares have 90+% downside.
        Author UpdateMay 15, 2015, 9:10 AMLOGG filed its 10-Q today.  The company generated 0 revenue (of course it has no product) and a $290,000 operating loss.  Cash was down to $81,000 at March 31, 2015.  The company has been issuing stock as payment for services to some vendors at a price of 20c.  I expect LOGG has burned through most of its remaining cash since March 31 and expect a capital raise very soon.  I continue to believe that this stock will ultimately be a zero.  Fueled by enthusiasm over the potential for wearable cameras, Lifelogger (OTCQB:LOGG) shares have risen five-fold from their 2014 low. While wearable camera market growth is evidenced by the tremendous success of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) selling millions in sporting applications and Taser's (TASR) rapid growth in wearable cameras for law enforcement personnel, Lifelogger has yet to release a product as the company has repeatedly delayed its product launch (discussed below). Moreover, a failed kickstarter campaign indicates that consumers lack interest in Lifelogger's product. Lifelogger ended 2014 with just $238,000 in cash but expects that it will burn through $900,000 during 2015, implying that the company will have to raise capital soon or shutter its doors. With minimal customer interest, no product, no patents, continued losses, a rapidly depleting cash position investors should avoid Lifelogger shares. Despite these many negatives, at $0.51 per share, the market is valuing Lifelogger at over $40 million. Enterprising investors may wish to consider shorting Lifelogger shares (at last check, Interactive Brokers had many shares available for borrow) as I expect that ultimately Lifelogger shares will prove to be worthless.

Background
Formerly Snap Online, a web marketing company which never achieved more than $45,000 in annual revenue, in January of 2014, the company changed its name to Lifelogger and began focusing on the wearable camera market. According to the most recent 10-K, Lifelogger has three full-time employees. The company's CEO is Steve Garner who has a background in real estate.
Consumer interest?
There does not seem to be a market for Lifelogger. Last year, Lifelogger attempted a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign lasted 49 days (ending in July of 2014) but Lifelogger only received contributions of $86,000, well short of its $150,000 target, indicating minimal interest in its product.

Continued Launch delays
The company has yet to introduce a commercial product and has consistently missed target launch dates. At the beginning 2014 CES (Consumer Electronic Show), Lifelogger CEO Steve Garner said the company would be mass producing in May of 2014 and be available to customers in June of 2014 (can be seen at 2:30 in the video). As mentioned above, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign in May but failed to attract much interest. While Lifelogger's Kickstarter campaign failed, it was able to raise $500,000 during the second half of 2014 ($250,000 in September and another $250,000 in December 2014). Despite receiving over 3x the funding sought by the Kickstarter campaign, Lifelogger still has not released a product. Further, in the company's December 2014 presentation, Lifelogger targeted public Beta testing to begin in May.


Source: Company presentation
On its website, Lifelogger solicits visitors to participate in its Beta testing. I signed up to participate in Beta testing but received an email telling me that Beta testing had not yet begun. It seems likely that there will be continued delays. Given the company's lack of financial resources (discussed below), it seems inconceivable that Lifelogger will commercialize a product any time in the near future.
Further, given how many offerings are already in the marketplace (there are at least 15 different makers of wearable cameras available today at Amazon), it is unclear how Lifelogger would differentiate itself if the company were able to bring a product to market.
Financial distress - Auditor issues Going Concern Clause
Lifelogger had just $238,000 in cash as of December 31, 2014. The company is rapidly burning cash and will likely only be able to fund another 1-2 months of operation without another equity raise (based on the expected $910,000 annual burn rate cited below in the 'Liquidity and Capital Resources' section). This lead its accountants to issue a going concern clause.

Source: 10-K
As you can see above, auditors have expressed substantial doubt about the company's ability to remain in business.
Intellectual property?
Without cash, it is unclear how Lifelogger can fund an R&D program (during 2014 Lifelogger spent just $114,000 on R&D) let alone attempt to market its product to customers. Further, the only intellectual property the company owns is the name Lifelogger. As shown below, Lifelogger does not own any patents - this was confirmed by Lena Cati, the company's investor contact (Lena works for the Equity Group, an investor relations firm that represents Lifelogger).


Source: 10-K
Conclusion
Despite all of these negatives, the company has a market capitalization of more than $40 million. With continued operating losses, a rapidly depleting cash balance, no product, and no patents, the author expects that shares will ultimately prove to be worthless.

Lifelogger Technologies Corp (OTCMKTS:LOGG) is trending up on strong volume after trading as low as $0.14 in recent days.
BrokerBank Securities said on May 18 ”Despite this recent news, the company reached a new 52 – week low during Friday’s trading as investors lost confidence in the company’s ability to become profitable in the future. Given the company’s weak sales, and relatively high market cap the company is expected to face headwinds in the near future.”
Lifelogger Technologies Corp (OTCMKTS:LOGG) bills itself as an emerging innovative wearable video and software company that is developing the way people capture, access, store and recall life’s unique memories through its true POV wearable video camera.
Currently they are in the process of finishing the hardware design of the LifeLogger; they say are working with a leader in the field of consumer electronics cameras to begin serial production of the camera in Q1/2015. LOGG is also upgrading their existing cloud based platform for storing, managing and displaying videos. Starting with their 3D video timeline and adding Video Stabilization, Geo Tagging, Custom in video tags, Face detection, OCR, voice detection, live streaming and social sharing.
According to the 10Q LOGG filed on November 10 they have just under $250,000 in the treasury and they have done $272,000 in revenues for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013 said to be derived from a licensing agreement the Company has in place in Hong Kong.
LOGG was formed in January after the name change from Snap Online Marketing Inc. Immediately after the merger the Company affected a 10 for 1 forward split of the stock.
Lifelogger is in the right place at the right time; the wearable camera market is taking off quickly with new subcategories already developing; besides sports cameras there are smart glasses such as the one’s being developed by Google and the Vuzix M100. There are also action cameras and personal wearable cameras as well as law enforcement wearable body cameras such as Taser Axon and Digital Ally.

The wearable camera market has exploded in recent years with the Google Glass initiative, VUZI M100 Smart Glasses and GoPro, the leader in this new and exciting field that recently saw an extremely successful IPO running from $28.65 to close to $100 a share.
With all this attention on the wearable camera market it was only a matter of time before a penny stock jumped on the bandwagon; enter LOGG maker of a Lifelogger, a fully hands-free, 5-megapixel wearable video camera that incorporates video, voice, text, and facial recognition into the camera, to fully immerse the user and others into a POV experience.
The Lifelogger camera will have the ability to electronically link to the Company’s proprietary cloud-based software solution that can be used by any compatible Android/ IOS device on the market. Many investors suggest this is where the real value in the Company lies.
On January 28 LOGG announced the appointment, effective immediately, of Philip van Nedervelde to its Advisory Board to actively reinforce and support LifeLogger’s executive team in roles including that of Senior VP of Design and Chief Evangelist.
A pioneering lifelogging practitioner and advocate for nearly 20 years, Philip followed his M.A. in Communication Science and postgraduate degree in Information Science & Interactive Media Design with several decades of entrepreneurial experience in international business development in cutting edge, emerging technologies including interactive multimedia, wearable sensors, personalized medicine for life extension, drone based sensor platforms, immersive telepresence using anthropomorphic android robotics, immerse virtual reality, online multi-user virtual worlds, data fusion & visualization for situational awareness in military and security applications.

The Company is engaged in the development and commercialization of a lifelogging camera and lifelogging-focused software tools that involve the process of collecting, organizing, perusing and sharing personal data. The Company has approximately two products under development, a cloud-based software solution, which it plans to integrate with the Pixorial software and a true point-of-view (POV) wearable video camera.The LifeLogger Platform offers smartphone users the ability to capture videos with geo location with a play back option that shows an interactive map of when and where it was taken. The Company makes lifelogging accessible to the market by taking videos and images right from users' smartphones, wearable camera and/or sensor solutions, and adding geographic, visual and test data designed to enhance the relevance and context of the information collected. It allows consumers to capture and live stream videos with geographic coordinates and automatic face detection and to tag special moments while recording. The video playback features an interactive map and ability to skip to in-video frames with faces detected and added tags. Search features allow users the ability to retrieve videos beyond the basic title and description, including location, face or in-line video tags. The Company has not generated any revenues.
