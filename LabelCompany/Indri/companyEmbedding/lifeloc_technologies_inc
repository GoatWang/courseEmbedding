FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Fraud and Identity Theft - Credit Advice by Experian
























Credit Advice » Fraud and Identity Theft 
Fraud and Identity TheftYou can take steps to protect yourself from credit fraud and identity theft. Explore to learn more about the warning signs of fraud and what to do if you’re a victim of identity theft.
How to Identify Fraud
To identify fraud, you should carefully review your credit report:

Accounts: If you see a newly opened account that you don’t recognize, this could be a sign that a criminal obtained a line of credit using your identity.
Inquiries: In the “Requests viewed by others” section of your credit report, review the list of creditors for any names you don’t recognize.
Addresses: If you discover an address you’ve never lived at on your credit report, this could be a sign that someone has tried to obtain credit in your name.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Experian CreditLock FAQs






What is a credit lock?
A credit lock allows you to easily lock your Credit Report, helping to protect you against identity theft and unwanted credit activity. If someone attempts to apply for credit in your name while your Report is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.
When locked, your Experian Credit Report is NOT accessible to:

Banks and lenders that check your Credit Report for a credit or loan application
Companies checking your Credit Report in order to open new utilities, cellular service or apartment rentals

When locked, your Experian Credit Report is accessible to:

You, as part of your Experian CreditWorksSM Premium membership
Potential employers or insurance companies during the application process
Companies that have an existing credit relationship with you
Collection agencies acting on behalf of companies you may owe
Government agencies in connection to a Child Support claim
Personalized offers from Experian, such as credit card offers, if you choose to receive them
Companies providing pre-screened credit card offers. Learn more about opting out of credit offers



How can Experian CreditLock help prevent credit fraud?
If an identity thief tries to apply for credit in your name, access to your Credit Report will be blocked when the lender tries to view it, stopping the crime before it starts. If someone tries to access your Report while it is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.


What kind of Alerts will I get with Experian CreditLock?
In addition to the regular alerts you receive as part of your membership, Experian CreditLock provides attempted inquiry alerts that inform you when someone attempts to apply for credit while your Report is locked. You will receive a confirmation alert when you lock or unlock your Experian Credit Report.






What does it mean if my Experian Credit Report is unlocked?

Banks or lenders may review your Report if you, or someone who claims to be you, applies for a loan or financing in your name.
Any company with permissible purpose may access your Report if it is unlocked. This means any company with a legal right, including any new or existing creditor wishing to review your Report or extend you credit; a Grand Jury request; a potential employer or an insurance company underwriting a policy.
To block unwanted inquiries and potential fraudulent activity, you may want to keep your Experian Credit Report locked until you’re in the market for credit or financing.



If I use Experian CreditLock, can any information, including new accounts, be posted to my Experian Credit Report?
When your Experian Credit Report is locked, new accounts may still be reported to Experian and posted to your Experian Credit Report if:

A creditor opens an account using a report from one of the other major credit bureaus that you have not locked or applied a security freeze.
You unlock your Experian Credit Report, granting access to a potential lender or creditor.



What is the difference between Experian CreditLock, a Security Freeze and a Fraud Alert?
With Experian CreditLock, you have greater control over who can view your Credit Report, blocking unwanted inquiries that result in extensions of credit. Locking your Credit Report gives you similar protection to a security freeze, but with additional advantages. Learn more about the differences between CreditLock, Security Freezes, and Fraud Alerts.


What happens if my Report is locked and I cancel or downgrade my Experian CreditWorks Premium membership?
Your Experian Credit Report will be unlocked at the end of your billing cycle.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

LifeLock Review
Latest News: Symantec, known for their leading anti-virus & cybersecurity software Norton, acquires LifeLock in 2017. The acquisition combines two leading organizations in the digital security field creating the largest and most capable digital security provider to date. This puts LifeLock leaps and bounds ahead of the pack adding even more value for anyone looking to purchase identity theft protection as it adds additional layers of security to an already stellar product.
When most people think identity theft protection, they think LifeLock. Since their aggressive marketing practices nearly 10 years ago where CEO, Todd Davis, drove around New York City flaunting his social security number fearlessly to now, LifeLock has led the way in both marketing itself as the leader in identity theft protection but also backing it up by evolving its product to lead in providing the best identity security on the market. Before we get into our likes and dislikes, it’s easy to see why LifeLock is our top pick.

What We Like 
We love the product evolution of LifeLock’s service and their constant investment into providing the best memberships possible for consumers. As technology and personal information monitoring becomes more robust, LifeLock stays at the forefront of those changes and incorporates elements that will yield better protection for its members, especially when compared to free credit monitoring services.
In 2012, LifeLock acquired ID Analytics, an enterprise risk management and consumer behavior insights technology used by both government agencies and U.S. corporations alike. With access to ID Analytics data, LifeLock holds a significant advantage from a technology standpoint over its competitors.
LifeLock’s membership options are also a big plus to their overall identity theft protection service offering. Not everyone has the same income levels, the same risk level, or same behaviors online or offline, but everyone IS at risk of having their identity stolen. LifeLock’s membership plan variety allows consumers to choose between the following 3 levels depending on needs and assets to protect (LifeLock Junior® membership is available only along with an adult membership.

LifeLock Standard™
LifeLock Advantage™
LifeLock Ultimate Plus™
LifeLock Junior®

In addition to their dedicated product evolution, they are also highly motivated in providing the highest quality customer service. We’ve heard numerous stories of LifeLock Identity Restoration Specialists developing long term relationships with LifeLock customers once those customers have experienced fraudulent activity and are in need of resolution and restoration. This is a testament to LifeLock’s care and dedication to its customers.
The evolution of their identity theft protection is also a big LIKE for us. With LifeLock’s premier products, LifeLock Advantage™ and LifeLock Ultimate Plus™, members receive regular credit reports and scores as part of their membership, all accessible through their online member portal 24/7.
What We Don’t Like 
There’s not much that we don’t like about LifeLock when we review its position in the identity theft protection space. After all, it has a price point that’s accessible for pretty much anyone and provides the best identity theft protection service available, what’s not to like?
We can point to allegations of LifeLock falsely marketing its product and misleading consumers, but the same can be said for hundreds of major companies and the reality is that LifeLock is the trailblazer in the identity theft protection space and everyone else is following. Any mistakes LifeLock has made along the way it has been accountable for and taken the necessary steps to resolve those issues.
Is LifeLock Worth It?
The answer is simple, if you’re going to invest in the safety of your personal information and purchase identity theft protection, your money is best spent enrolling in LifeLock. Any of LifeLock’s memberships provide as much or more protection, and reliable protection, than other providers on the market hands down.
LifeLock and ITPB are so confident that you’ll be satisfied with the service, that through this LifeLock review we’re offering a free 30 day trial and 10% off your membership pricing for life! Click here to see plans and pricing and enroll online.



How It Works
How LifeLock Works
LifeLock identity protection services offer three layers of protection, Detect, Alert, and Restore. And LifeLock separates itself with the addition of proprietary technology and the experience as an industry leader to add confidence and trust behind its platform.
Detection
Without a doubt LifeLock offers the most robust identification and detection capabilities of all providers through its ID Analytics data & technology capabilities. No other identity theft protection provider can match the breadth of visibility and algorithmic insight that LifeLock provides through its technology platform. Some key features include:

ID Network covers close to 100% of Americans monitoring over a trillion data points and spanning all industries from cell phone applications to ecommerce transactions to change of address. It’s simply the best there is, plain and simple.
Real Time Data provides extremely low latency and provides an up-to-the-minute view of event, consumer, and identity risk.
Analytics & Insights including elements like personal behavior analysis and machine learning algorithms inject incredible intelligence into LifeLock reviews of identity risk and fraud in real time.

Alerts
Another advantage of LifeLock comes in its “Alert” phase of identity protection. Because of their tremendous ability to observe, evaluate, and recognize malicious behavior of its customer’s information through their “Detection” technology, LifeLock also delivers best in class alerts when something goes wrong. Let’s take a closer look:
Proprietary LifeLock Identity Alert® system notifies customers of identity misuse. Notifications can be received via text, email, or by phone – you get to choose. Additionally, it’s not just an alert as these notifications are interactive and require the customer (you) to verify the transaction.
Restoration
Now that we’ve detected suspicious activity on a customer’s account and have notified and verified that the event was suspicious, the LifeLock restoration and remediation team steps in.

We know what to do. LifeLock’s U.S.-based Identity Protection Agents are ready to help with identity theft restoration. And if your identity is ever compromised, an Identity Restoration Specialist takes charge.

Most people familiar with identity theft protection services are familiar with LifeLock’s $1 million guarantee**. But what exactly does that mean? No, they’re not going to give you a million dollars if your identity is stolen and no they’re not going to repay you if you incur damages up to a $1,000,000 as a result of ID theft.
What LifeLock’s team will do is come to your aid in helping resolve your identity theft event every step of the way. So, what about the $1 million, right? LifeLock will spend up to that amount to back your restoration and remediation expenses like lawyers, investigators, or anyone needed to get your life back on track. Additionally, included in your membership and $1 million guarantee** are reimbursements for expenses that you incur along the way including:

Document replacement fees
Child and/or elderly care
Fraudulent withdrawals
Travel expenses
Lost wages

Expertise & Knowledge Base
As a LifeLock member you’re benefited with all of the great assets listed above but what’s rarely mentioned is LifeLock’s leadership, experience, and overall expertise in the world of identity theft and fraud.
LifeLock provides endless resources to its customers and even those who are not customers to educate and inform themselves on the realities of ID theft and ways to stay as risk-free as possible. You can also point to LifeLock’s unprecedented involvement in the community through programs like the Parent Teachers Association (PTA), law enforcement education, CyberWatch, ETPRO, and the C3 conference as additional backbone to their industry leadership.



Plans & Pricing
LifeLock Plans & Pricing Review
LifeLock has continually evolved its product that started as just one identity protection solution to what is now a suite of services to fit a variety of needs based on what the consumer is looking for. Here’s a quick and easy breakdown of each LifeLock product.
LifeLock Standard™
The entry level product of LifeLock’s suite of services, LifeLock Standard™, offers more than entry-level identity theft protection. LifeLock Standard™ identity protection includes:

LifeLock Identity Alert® System
Lost Wallet Protection
Address Change Verification
Black Market Website Surveillance
Reduced Pre-Approved Credit Card Offers
Live Member Service Support
Identity Restoration Support
$25,000 Lost Funds Reimbursement
$1 Million Total Service Guarantee**
Regular Price: $9.99/mo

LifeLock Standard™ Review

During our review of LifeLock’s products we found that all of them from top to bottom provide solid protection and resolution for identity theft. Beginning with LifeLock Standard™ as their base product is a great place to start. Our LifeLock Standard™ review shows that this base, entry level product provides superior protection at a very affordable price, especially when combined with ITPB’s 10% off and 30 days free offer. Subscribers get protection from LifeLock’s proprietary ID Analytics technology as well as their basic monitoring which we’ve come to find during our review of LifeLock is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.

LifeLock Advantage™
Recently, LifeLock introduced an intermediate product to service those consumers who are looking for more than the basic level of protection provided in LifeLock Standard™ but maybe don’t want to spend the $30 per month cost of the Ultimate Plus product, or simply don’t have a need for that level of protection. LifeLock Advantage serves that consumer well and comes with all services included in LifeLock Standard™ as well as:

Fictitious Identity Monitoring
Court Records Scanning
Data Breach Notifications
Credit Card Activity Alerts†
Checking and Savings Account Activity Alerts†
Online Annual Credit Report
Online Annual Credit Score
$100,000 Lost Funds Reimbursement
Regular Price: $19.99/mo

LifeLock Advantage™ Review

Our Review of LifeLock Advantage™ as a stand-alone product was eye-opening and impressive. For the cost of service, we don’t find more value anywhere in the market. In addition to the great protection and resolution you receive in LifeLock’s base product, LifeLock Standard™, with Advantage™ you get the addition of monitoring of your financial accounts such as checking, savings, and credit accounts. This means LifeLock is constantly reviewing your transactions and looking for anything out of the ordinary they can alert you of to stay in front of any potential identity theft. This monitoring is much closer to real-time than credit report and score monitoring which tends to have a lag before any fraud is recognized. If you’re at the point of reviewing LifeLock products to enroll in, take a heavy look at LifeLock Advantage™ because it’s value is hard to beat.

LifeLock Ultimate Plus™
If you couldn’t tell by the name, LifeLock Ultimate Plus is the flagship and most comprehensive level of coverage offered by LifeLock and includes everything in theLifeLock Standard™ and Lifelock Advantage™ plans, plus:

Checking and Savings Account Application Alerts
Bank Account Takeover Alerts
Investment Account Activity Alerts
Credit Inquiry Alerts
Online Annual Tri-Bureau Credit Reports
Online Annual Tri-Bureau Credit Scores
Monthly Credit Score Tracking
File Sharing Network Searches
Sex Offender Registry Reports
Priority Live Member Service Support
$1,000,000 Lost Funds Reimbursement
Regular Price: $29.99/mo

LifeLock Ultimate Plus™ Review

Reviewing LifeLock Ultimate Plus™ is easy, just try to find what it doesn’t provide because all of the important items are taken care of in spades. Protection from Lifelock’s ID Analytics and Identity Alert® System, financial activity monitoring, investment account monitoring, dark web trolling, credit reports and scores, LifeLock’s online member portal with all the bells and whistles, and who can forget their U.S. based members services team and $1 Million service guarantee**. Review LifeLock Ultimate Plus™ and you’ll find that it has it all bases covered, no exceptions, and for a very fair price. Our top recommended identity theft protection product hands down.

Additional LifeLock Products
LifeLock offers additional products outside of its primary three identity theft protection solutions listed above in an effort to provide consumers and families with every they need to keep their information safe in today’s digital world filled with threats to your personal information. Those products include.
LifeLock Junior®
As an add on product to LifeLock’s adult plans listed above, they offer LifeLock Junior® designed to provide identity theft protection for children under the age of 18 as their identities can be stolen as easily as anyone else. Services for this product include several of those that are available in LifeLock’s adult products but only those that apply to children. Included services are:

LifeLock Identity Alert® System
Lost Wallet Protection
Black Market Website Surveillance
Credit File Detection
File-Sharing Network Searches
Live Member Service Support
Identity Restoration Support
$1 Million Total Service Guarantee**
Regular Price: $5.99/mo

LifeLock Wallet™
With mobile lifestyles becoming the wave of the future, LifeLock satisfies those mobile junkies with their LifeLock Wallet™ app. With the app installed on your apple or android device, you can store everything you keep in your wallet or purse right on your mobile device. Store your driver’s license, insurance cards, credit or debit cards, and even gift cards.

LifeLock Wallet™ features include:

Convenient Cloud Storage
Lost Wallet™ Protection
$.99 Credit Score




Member Services
LifeLock Member Support Review
LifeLock members have access to excellent member amenities including a fully interactive member portal as well as live U.S. based customer support. The member portal (more details below) allows you to access and view your alerts, identity protection tips, view your credit score, and setup your account.
Customer Support
As a member of any LifeLock plan, you have access to their U.S. based live member services team and Identity Restoration Specialists. In the event of identity fraud the LifeLock support team members will work with victims from start to finish in helping restore their identity and any compromised items. This includes step-by-step guidance, providing any educational or necessary information, and even being present on phone calls or other communication on the way to restoring a victim’s identity.
General Support: 1-800-987-6543
Member Services: Access Via Member Portal
Member Portal

Through the LifeLock member portal dashboard, users can see a snapshot of all critical information associated to their identity and LifeLock services. From here, users can drill down deeper into setting up their account, viewing their alerts and notifications, reviewing their credit score, and more.

Account setup is a cinch! Within the Manage Account tab you simply click “Add Account,” select your financial institution, and enter your password then LifeLock does the rest by scanning all of your transactions through their proprietary ID Analytics software and begins assessing irregular activity to alert you of a potential theft.

You can also access your credit score and view changes to your score over different time periods. LifeLock also provides score factors that contribute to where your score is and why at any given time – these are the same data points provided by the credit bureaus.




More Info
LifeLock History
LifeLock was founded and currently based in Tempe, AZ by Todd Davis and Robert Maynard in 2005 to bring to market an American identity theft protection company intended to identify and potentially stop fraudulent credit and non-credit related activities on an individual’s personal information. Amidst controversy in 2007, Maynard left the company leaving Davis as the sole CEO. Soon after, LifeLock and TransUnion came upon an agreement to automate the process of notifying customers of potentially harmful use via their credit reports. Later, LifeLock evolved its detection capabilities with the acquisition of ID Analytics following a round of funding in March of 2012. LifeLock announced its initial public offering shortly thereafter and released stock to the market in Q3 2012. In late 2013, LifeLock reviewed and added to its stable of services the Lemon Wallet through an acquisition costing the company $42.6 Million.
Investor Information
LifeLock, Inc. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol LOCK. The company made its initial public offering (IPO) on October 3, 2012 at a starting price of $9.00 per share with a total volume offering of 15,700,000 shares. The stock saw a gradual increase in its price reaching a high of over $22.00 per share but seeing a low after news of a pending FTC investigation announced on July 21, 2015 of $7.18 per share (updated August 17, 2015)
Frequently Asked Questions
What will LifeLock do for me?
Life Lock is the most well-known identity theft protection company, and they’re committed to providing you with an experience you’ll want to tell your friends about. You’re getting total protection on their premium plans, with risk management assessment along with credit, medical and personal information monitoring. They also have a $1 million insurance policy, and they’re known for being generous with their customers.
How much will LifeLock cost me?
Life Lock Standard protection starts at $9.99 a month, while the mid-grade plan is $19.99 a month and the ultimate protection is $29.99. Their plan solely for those under 18 years of age is $5.99 with a paid adult membership.
Will LifeLock stop identity theft from happening to me?
Even Life Lock cannot prevent all identity theft, and they make sure they say it in their ads. The CEO famously found out that sadly he was not as immune as he thought. While they can’t stop it, they can make it extremely unlikely you’ll have a problem, and they assign a specialist to help if you do.
Will LifeLock help me after identity theft happens to me?
Yes, even their least expensive plans comes with live help. All of their agents are based in the US, and they’re available every hour of the day so you always have someone to call in an emergency.
Is LifeLock a scam?
No. The company has a loyal customer base, and while they don’t have a perfect grade from the BBB (A-), their efforts have been noticed and the company continues to thrive.
Is LifeLock worth the cost of services?
The fact that they are so focused on research and development at their company makes us say yes. Hackers change their techniques faster than they change their clothes, so a company that specializes is a treasure.
How legitimate is Life Lock’s service?
It was ordered to pay the FTC millions of dollars in 2010, but it’s come a long way since then. We do not hesitate in recommending this product. It’s not perfect, but that’s true of any of the services.
Will using LifeLock affect my credit score?
No. When Life Lock checks your credit score, it does not affect it the same way as if a lender pulls your report. LifeLock gives you the means to improve your credit score by monitoring so you can learn more about which decisions affect you most.
Is it safe to give Life Lock my information & SSN?
Yes. Again, nothing in life is ever guaranteed, but the company has proven that they’re not reckless with your data.
Can I cancel my LifeLock account anytime?
Yes, and you will receive a pro-rated refund as long as you purchased your plan directly through Life Lock. Should you have done it through a third party, you will not receive a refund.
Can I cancel my Life Lock account online?
You can cancel online through your account portal if you choose any of the protection plans.
Can I do what LifeLock provides myself?
No. Life Lock is not merely checking your credit report the same way you could do every month. They have advanced technology to monitor and protect you, and they put their resources to good use. Their knowledge and computer power extends far beyond the standard individual.
How does Life Lock collect my credit score?
LifeLock has relationships with all three credit bureaus and pulls reports once you sign up through their company.
Does Life Lock offer family plan options?
They do not have an express family plan, but they do have LifeLock Junior which is available with a paid adult plan for an additional $5.99.
How does LifeLock protect my identity?
They work with a trillion data points to make sure your information is only found where you want it to be found. This includes your credit, demographic and medical information as well.
How frequently does Life Lock update my credit score?
They consistently monitor your score at all times of the day.
Which credit bureau’s does LifeLock use?
Life Lock works with all three credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax.
Where is Life Lock located?
LifeLock is in Tempe, Arizona.

I don’t like life lock but my husband does and he pays for it. I was notified once of a problem with a judgement filed against me and all I remember is that it is a state I have never lived in. I called life lock and was told I had to call the company that was granted the judgement. Which I did I called Life Lock back and explained it was not me and I was told WELL WE CAN’T HELP EVERYONE. So I think they r full of bull…. ha u get your own agent to work on your case. Lies all lies

Very upset,
Registered on Sunday 26, 2117 then tried to go to customer to add more info and they could not find me.
Went back to register again, said they couldn’t find the original. Started all over and paid for it, never got an email from them. So started today Monday 27th, still no email and still could not find me.
I talked to 5 people today and was disconnected each time right after giving my name. This is not a good start with LIFELOCK. I just want to get this over. Identity stolen last week and LIFELOCK was recommended to me. Please get your phone lines fixed and take care of your customers. STILL WAIITING for email to verify if new enrollment did their job.
FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER.

My house was broken into about 6 months ago and the thieves stole a bunch of papers and stuff with personal information on it. They even got my sons birth certificate! I immediately signed up for LifeLock and have been very happy with the service. Last week I got an alert about someone trying to use my credit at Verizon for something and LifeLock was able to stop it before anything bad could happen. I’m sure this was the same jerk trying to use my name and am so thankful I had LifeLock when he did!

I’ve had Lifelock for about 4 months and am happy with the service so far. Setting up my account was easy and I like the bank account activity alerts that I get emailed to me as well as the free credit score tracking on my account page. Overall, I’m happy with Lifelock’s service.

I’ve been a member for a bit over 2 years. Lots of players in this market but LifeLock has been around the longest with the proven history, the two biggest reasons I went with them over the others. Overall mostly happy with the service, I get notified whenever credit is applied for in my name (ie: I buy a new car/house, or get credit card), when changes are made to my financial accounts, etc.

Even though a little pricey for my budget LifeLock is great for ID Protection (but I guess you get what you pay for). Their website is very user friendly and it’s really easy to set up your accounts. They provide excellent customer service should you have any questions or concerns. In addition to everything else they monitor all your accounts very thoroughly with timely information and updates.

I’ve had LifeLock for almost a year now and am very happy with the service. After having setup all of my account info and personal information in their member portal (which was very easy), its clear their system is keeping track of my transactions and monitoring financial activity by the frequency of alerts they send. However, I do wish they were a little more timely as it sometimes takes a day or two before I receive an alert about a purchase I’ve made.
I haven’t had any issues yet with fraudulent activity to REALLY see what their made of but I’m confident that if something we’re to happen I’d be in good hands with them.

Lifeloc Technologies Announces Acquisition of R.A.D.A.R. Product | Business Wire
























































Lifeloc Technologies Announces Acquisition of R.A.D.A.R. Product






March 17, 2017 10:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WHEAT RIDGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. is pleased to announce the acquisition of the 
      R.A.D.A.R.® Real-Time Alcohol Detection and Recognition 
      Product from the Track Group, Inc. The R.A.D.A.R. device is one of the 
      most comprehensive alcohol offender monitoring systems available today. 
      It is a fuel cell-based breath alcohol testing system with 24/7 
      monitoring and reporting capability. R.A.D.A.R. units include two forms 
      of biometrics to confirm the identity of the subscriber.
    


      The R.A.D.A.R. device provides monitoring with real-time reporting of 
      program compliance or violation to a court-appointed officer as an 
      important part of alternatives to incarceration for alcohol related 
      offenses. Amy Evans, Lifeloc Sales Director, notes, “Our salesforce is 
      excited about adding this complementary product to our law enforcement 
      portfolio and the new opportunities we expect it to create in the 
      workplace.”
    

      Mark Lary, Lifeloc Director of Engineering, adds, “The acquisition of 
      R.A.D.A.R. will open an entirely new market for Lifeloc in remote 
      offender monitoring. The R.A.D.A.R. device’s biometrics and 
      communication with our advanced fuel cell technology create a unique 
      synergy, providing us the ability to expand our breath alcohol 
      offerings.”
    

      “Lifeloc has a long history of manufacturing top quality, professional 
      breathalyzers, and bringing the R.A.D.A.R. products in house fits well 
      with our capabilities. The R.A.D.A.R. device represents an important 
      expansion of our business model, which we expect will result in a 
      recurring revenue stream from device leasing and monitoring, as opposed 
      to a series of one time sales of breathalyzers,” says Dr. Wayne 
      Willkomm, Lifeloc CEO.
    

      Lifeloc is purchasing all the Track Group assets relevant to the 
      R.A.D.A.R. device, including the current device inventory, manufacturing 
      assets, monitoring software, and the intellectual property which 
      includes issued and pending U.S. patents, along with associated 
      international applications. No Track Group employees will be joining 
      Lifeloc as part of the transaction.

Four Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Experian CreditLock FAQs






What is a credit lock?
A credit lock allows you to easily lock your Credit Report, helping to protect you against identity theft and unwanted credit activity. If someone attempts to apply for credit in your name while your Report is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.
When locked, your Experian Credit Report is NOT accessible to:

Banks and lenders that check your Credit Report for a credit or loan application
Companies checking your Credit Report in order to open new utilities, cellular service or apartment rentals

When locked, your Experian Credit Report is accessible to:

You, as part of your Experian CreditWorksSM Premium membership
Potential employers or insurance companies during the application process
Companies that have an existing credit relationship with you
Collection agencies acting on behalf of companies you may owe
Government agencies in connection to a Child Support claim
Personalized offers from Experian, such as credit card offers, if you choose to receive them
Companies providing pre-screened credit card offers. Learn more about opting out of credit offers



How can Experian CreditLock help prevent credit fraud?
If an identity thief tries to apply for credit in your name, access to your Credit Report will be blocked when the lender tries to view it, stopping the crime before it starts. If someone tries to access your Report while it is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.


What kind of Alerts will I get with Experian CreditLock?
In addition to the regular alerts you receive as part of your membership, Experian CreditLock provides attempted inquiry alerts that inform you when someone attempts to apply for credit while your Report is locked. You will receive a confirmation alert when you lock or unlock your Experian Credit Report.






What does it mean if my Experian Credit Report is unlocked?

Banks or lenders may review your Report if you, or someone who claims to be you, applies for a loan or financing in your name.
Any company with permissible purpose may access your Report if it is unlocked. This means any company with a legal right, including any new or existing creditor wishing to review your Report or extend you credit; a Grand Jury request; a potential employer or an insurance company underwriting a policy.
To block unwanted inquiries and potential fraudulent activity, you may want to keep your Experian Credit Report locked until you’re in the market for credit or financing.



If I use Experian CreditLock, can any information, including new accounts, be posted to my Experian Credit Report?
When your Experian Credit Report is locked, new accounts may still be reported to Experian and posted to your Experian Credit Report if:

A creditor opens an account using a report from one of the other major credit bureaus that you have not locked or applied a security freeze.
You unlock your Experian Credit Report, granting access to a potential lender or creditor.



What is the difference between Experian CreditLock, a Security Freeze and a Fraud Alert?
With Experian CreditLock, you have greater control over who can view your Credit Report, blocking unwanted inquiries that result in extensions of credit. Locking your Credit Report gives you similar protection to a security freeze, but with additional advantages. Learn more about the differences between CreditLock, Security Freezes, and Fraud Alerts.


What happens if my Report is locked and I cancel or downgrade my Experian CreditWorks Premium membership?
Your Experian Credit Report will be unlocked at the end of your billing cycle.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

LifeLock Review
Latest News: Symantec, known for their leading anti-virus & cybersecurity software Norton, acquires LifeLock in 2017. The acquisition combines two leading organizations in the digital security field creating the largest and most capable digital security provider to date. This puts LifeLock leaps and bounds ahead of the pack adding even more value for anyone looking to purchase identity theft protection as it adds additional layers of security to an already stellar product.
When most people think identity theft protection, they think LifeLock. Since their aggressive marketing practices nearly 10 years ago where CEO, Todd Davis, drove around New York City flaunting his social security number fearlessly to now, LifeLock has led the way in both marketing itself as the leader in identity theft protection but also backing it up by evolving its product to lead in providing the best identity security on the market. Before we get into our likes and dislikes, it’s easy to see why LifeLock is our top pick.

What We Like 
We love the product evolution of LifeLock’s service and their constant investment into providing the best memberships possible for consumers. As technology and personal information monitoring becomes more robust, LifeLock stays at the forefront of those changes and incorporates elements that will yield better protection for its members, especially when compared to free credit monitoring services.
In 2012, LifeLock acquired ID Analytics, an enterprise risk management and consumer behavior insights technology used by both government agencies and U.S. corporations alike. With access to ID Analytics data, LifeLock holds a significant advantage from a technology standpoint over its competitors.
LifeLock’s membership options are also a big plus to their overall identity theft protection service offering. Not everyone has the same income levels, the same risk level, or same behaviors online or offline, but everyone IS at risk of having their identity stolen. LifeLock’s membership plan variety allows consumers to choose between the following 3 levels depending on needs and assets to protect (LifeLock Junior® membership is available only along with an adult membership.

LifeLock Standard™
LifeLock Advantage™
LifeLock Ultimate Plus™
LifeLock Junior®

In addition to their dedicated product evolution, they are also highly motivated in providing the highest quality customer service. We’ve heard numerous stories of LifeLock Identity Restoration Specialists developing long term relationships with LifeLock customers once those customers have experienced fraudulent activity and are in need of resolution and restoration. This is a testament to LifeLock’s care and dedication to its customers.
The evolution of their identity theft protection is also a big LIKE for us. With LifeLock’s premier products, LifeLock Advantage™ and LifeLock Ultimate Plus™, members receive regular credit reports and scores as part of their membership, all accessible through their online member portal 24/7.
What We Don’t Like 
There’s not much that we don’t like about LifeLock when we review its position in the identity theft protection space. After all, it has a price point that’s accessible for pretty much anyone and provides the best identity theft protection service available, what’s not to like?
We can point to allegations of LifeLock falsely marketing its product and misleading consumers, but the same can be said for hundreds of major companies and the reality is that LifeLock is the trailblazer in the identity theft protection space and everyone else is following. Any mistakes LifeLock has made along the way it has been accountable for and taken the necessary steps to resolve those issues.
Is LifeLock Worth It?
The answer is simple, if you’re going to invest in the safety of your personal information and purchase identity theft protection, your money is best spent enrolling in LifeLock. Any of LifeLock’s memberships provide as much or more protection, and reliable protection, than other providers on the market hands down.
LifeLock and ITPB are so confident that you’ll be satisfied with the service, that through this LifeLock review we’re offering a free 30 day trial and 10% off your membership pricing for life! Click here to see plans and pricing and enroll online.



How It Works
How LifeLock Works
LifeLock identity protection services offer three layers of protection, Detect, Alert, and Restore. And LifeLock separates itself with the addition of proprietary technology and the experience as an industry leader to add confidence and trust behind its platform.
Detection
Without a doubt LifeLock offers the most robust identification and detection capabilities of all providers through its ID Analytics data & technology capabilities. No other identity theft protection provider can match the breadth of visibility and algorithmic insight that LifeLock provides through its technology platform. Some key features include:

ID Network covers close to 100% of Americans monitoring over a trillion data points and spanning all industries from cell phone applications to ecommerce transactions to change of address. It’s simply the best there is, plain and simple.
Real Time Data provides extremely low latency and provides an up-to-the-minute view of event, consumer, and identity risk.
Analytics & Insights including elements like personal behavior analysis and machine learning algorithms inject incredible intelligence into LifeLock reviews of identity risk and fraud in real time.

Alerts
Another advantage of LifeLock comes in its “Alert” phase of identity protection. Because of their tremendous ability to observe, evaluate, and recognize malicious behavior of its customer’s information through their “Detection” technology, LifeLock also delivers best in class alerts when something goes wrong. Let’s take a closer look:
Proprietary LifeLock Identity Alert® system notifies customers of identity misuse. Notifications can be received via text, email, or by phone – you get to choose. Additionally, it’s not just an alert as these notifications are interactive and require the customer (you) to verify the transaction.
Restoration
Now that we’ve detected suspicious activity on a customer’s account and have notified and verified that the event was suspicious, the LifeLock restoration and remediation team steps in.

We know what to do. LifeLock’s U.S.-based Identity Protection Agents are ready to help with identity theft restoration. And if your identity is ever compromised, an Identity Restoration Specialist takes charge.

Most people familiar with identity theft protection services are familiar with LifeLock’s $1 million guarantee**. But what exactly does that mean? No, they’re not going to give you a million dollars if your identity is stolen and no they’re not going to repay you if you incur damages up to a $1,000,000 as a result of ID theft.
What LifeLock’s team will do is come to your aid in helping resolve your identity theft event every step of the way. So, what about the $1 million, right? LifeLock will spend up to that amount to back your restoration and remediation expenses like lawyers, investigators, or anyone needed to get your life back on track. Additionally, included in your membership and $1 million guarantee** are reimbursements for expenses that you incur along the way including:

Document replacement fees
Child and/or elderly care
Fraudulent withdrawals
Travel expenses
Lost wages

Expertise & Knowledge Base
As a LifeLock member you’re benefited with all of the great assets listed above but what’s rarely mentioned is LifeLock’s leadership, experience, and overall expertise in the world of identity theft and fraud.
LifeLock provides endless resources to its customers and even those who are not customers to educate and inform themselves on the realities of ID theft and ways to stay as risk-free as possible. You can also point to LifeLock’s unprecedented involvement in the community through programs like the Parent Teachers Association (PTA), law enforcement education, CyberWatch, ETPRO, and the C3 conference as additional backbone to their industry leadership.



Plans & Pricing
LifeLock Plans & Pricing Review
LifeLock has continually evolved its product that started as just one identity protection solution to what is now a suite of services to fit a variety of needs based on what the consumer is looking for. Here’s a quick and easy breakdown of each LifeLock product.
LifeLock Standard™
The entry level product of LifeLock’s suite of services, LifeLock Standard™, offers more than entry-level identity theft protection. LifeLock Standard™ identity protection includes:

LifeLock Identity Alert® System
Lost Wallet Protection
Address Change Verification
Black Market Website Surveillance
Reduced Pre-Approved Credit Card Offers
Live Member Service Support
Identity Restoration Support
$25,000 Lost Funds Reimbursement
$1 Million Total Service Guarantee**
Regular Price: $9.99/mo

LifeLock Standard™ Review

During our review of LifeLock’s products we found that all of them from top to bottom provide solid protection and resolution for identity theft. Beginning with LifeLock Standard™ as their base product is a great place to start. Our LifeLock Standard™ review shows that this base, entry level product provides superior protection at a very affordable price, especially when combined with ITPB’s 10% off and 30 days free offer. Subscribers get protection from LifeLock’s proprietary ID Analytics technology as well as their basic monitoring which we’ve come to find during our review of LifeLock is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.

LifeLock Advantage™
Recently, LifeLock introduced an intermediate product to service those consumers who are looking for more than the basic level of protection provided in LifeLock Standard™ but maybe don’t want to spend the $30 per month cost of the Ultimate Plus product, or simply don’t have a need for that level of protection. LifeLock Advantage serves that consumer well and comes with all services included in LifeLock Standard™ as well as:

Fictitious Identity Monitoring
Court Records Scanning
Data Breach Notifications
Credit Card Activity Alerts†
Checking and Savings Account Activity Alerts†
Online Annual Credit Report
Online Annual Credit Score
$100,000 Lost Funds Reimbursement
Regular Price: $19.99/mo

LifeLock Advantage™ Review

Our Review of LifeLock Advantage™ as a stand-alone product was eye-opening and impressive. For the cost of service, we don’t find more value anywhere in the market. In addition to the great protection and resolution you receive in LifeLock’s base product, LifeLock Standard™, with Advantage™ you get the addition of monitoring of your financial accounts such as checking, savings, and credit accounts. This means LifeLock is constantly reviewing your transactions and looking for anything out of the ordinary they can alert you of to stay in front of any potential identity theft. This monitoring is much closer to real-time than credit report and score monitoring which tends to have a lag before any fraud is recognized. If you’re at the point of reviewing LifeLock products to enroll in, take a heavy look at LifeLock Advantage™ because it’s value is hard to beat.

LifeLock Ultimate Plus™
If you couldn’t tell by the name, LifeLock Ultimate Plus is the flagship and most comprehensive level of coverage offered by LifeLock and includes everything in theLifeLock Standard™ and Lifelock Advantage™ plans, plus:

Checking and Savings Account Application Alerts
Bank Account Takeover Alerts
Investment Account Activity Alerts
Credit Inquiry Alerts
Online Annual Tri-Bureau Credit Reports
Online Annual Tri-Bureau Credit Scores
Monthly Credit Score Tracking
File Sharing Network Searches
Sex Offender Registry Reports
Priority Live Member Service Support
$1,000,000 Lost Funds Reimbursement

LifeLock Member Support Review
LifeLock members have access to excellent member amenities including a fully interactive member portal as well as live U.S. based customer support. The member portal (more details below) allows you to access and view your alerts, identity protection tips, view your credit score, and setup your account.
Customer Support
As a member of any LifeLock plan, you have access to their U.S. based live member services team and Identity Restoration Specialists. In the event of identity fraud the LifeLock support team members will work with victims from start to finish in helping restore their identity and any compromised items. This includes step-by-step guidance, providing any educational or necessary information, and even being present on phone calls or other communication on the way to restoring a victim’s identity.
General Support: 1-800-987-6543
Member Services: Access Via Member Portal
Member Portal

Through the LifeLock member portal dashboard, users can see a snapshot of all critical information associated to their identity and LifeLock services. From here, users can drill down deeper into setting up their account, viewing their alerts and notifications, reviewing their credit score, and more.

Account setup is a cinch! Within the Manage Account tab you simply click “Add Account,” select your financial institution, and enter your password then LifeLock does the rest by scanning all of your transactions through their proprietary ID Analytics software and begins assessing irregular activity to alert you of a potential theft.

You can also access your credit score and view changes to your score over different time periods. LifeLock also provides score factors that contribute to where your score is and why at any given time – these are the same data points provided by the credit bureaus.




More Info
LifeLock History
LifeLock was founded and currently based in Tempe, AZ by Todd Davis and Robert Maynard in 2005 to bring to market an American identity theft protection company intended to identify and potentially stop fraudulent credit and non-credit related activities on an individual’s personal information. Amidst controversy in 2007, Maynard left the company leaving Davis as the sole CEO. Soon after, LifeLock and TransUnion came upon an agreement to automate the process of notifying customers of potentially harmful use via their credit reports. Later, LifeLock evolved its detection capabilities with the acquisition of ID Analytics following a round of funding in March of 2012. LifeLock announced its initial public offering shortly thereafter and released stock to the market in Q3 2012. In late 2013, LifeLock reviewed and added to its stable of services the Lemon Wallet through an acquisition costing the company $42.6 Million.
Investor Information
LifeLock, Inc. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol LOCK. The company made its initial public offering (IPO) on October 3, 2012 at a starting price of $9.00 per share with a total volume offering of 15,700,000 shares. The stock saw a gradual increase in its price reaching a high of over $22.00 per share but seeing a low after news of a pending FTC investigation announced on July 21, 2015 of $7.18 per share (updated August 17, 2015)
Frequently Asked Questions
What will LifeLock do for me?
Life Lock is the most well-known identity theft protection company, and they’re committed to providing you with an experience you’ll want to tell your friends about. You’re getting total protection on their premium plans, with risk management assessment along with credit, medical and personal information monitoring. They also have a $1 million insurance policy, and they’re known for being generous with their customers.
How much will LifeLock cost me?
Life Lock Standard protection starts at $9.99 a month, while the mid-grade plan is $19.99 a month and the ultimate protection is $29.99. Their plan solely for those under 18 years of age is $5.99 with a paid adult membership.
Will LifeLock stop identity theft from happening to me?
Even Life Lock cannot prevent all identity theft, and they make sure they say it in their ads. The CEO famously found out that sadly he was not as immune as he thought. While they can’t stop it, they can make it extremely unlikely you’ll have a problem, and they assign a specialist to help if you do.
Will LifeLock help me after identity theft happens to me?
Yes, even their least expensive plans comes with live help. All of their agents are based in the US, and they’re available every hour of the day so you always have someone to call in an emergency.
Is LifeLock a scam?
No. The company has a loyal customer base, and while they don’t have a perfect grade from the BBB (A-), their efforts have been noticed and the company continues to thrive.
Is LifeLock worth the cost of services?
The fact that they are so focused on research and development at their company makes us say yes. Hackers change their techniques faster than they change their clothes, so a company that specializes is a treasure.
How legitimate is Life Lock’s service?
It was ordered to pay the FTC millions of dollars in 2010, but it’s come a long way since then. We do not hesitate in recommending this product. It’s not perfect, but that’s true of any of the services.
Will using LifeLock affect my credit score?
No. When Life Lock checks your credit score, it does not affect it the same way as if a lender pulls your report. LifeLock gives you the means to improve your credit score by monitoring so you can learn more about which decisions affect you most.
Is it safe to give Life Lock my information & SSN?
Yes. Again, nothing in life is ever guaranteed, but the company has proven that they’re not reckless with your data.
Can I cancel my LifeLock account anytime?
Yes, and you will receive a pro-rated refund as long as you purchased your plan directly through Life Lock. Should you have done it through a third party, you will not receive a refund.
Can I cancel my Life Lock account online?
You can cancel online through your account portal if you choose any of the protection plans.
Can I do what LifeLock provides myself?
No. Life Lock is not merely checking your credit report the same way you could do every month. They have advanced technology to monitor and protect you, and they put their resources to good use. Their knowledge and computer power extends far beyond the standard individual.
How does Life Lock collect my credit score?
LifeLock has relationships with all three credit bureaus and pulls reports once you sign up through their company.
Does Life Lock offer family plan options?
They do not have an express family plan, but they do have LifeLock Junior which is available with a paid adult plan for an additional $5.99.
How does LifeLock protect my identity?
They work with a trillion data points to make sure your information is only found where you want it to be found. This includes your credit, demographic and medical information as well.
How frequently does Life Lock update my credit score?
They consistently monitor your score at all times of the day.
Which credit bureau’s does LifeLock use?
Life Lock works with all three credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax.
Where is Life Lock located?
LifeLock is in Tempe, Arizona.

I don’t like life lock but my husband does and he pays for it. I was notified once of a problem with a judgement filed against me and all I remember is that it is a state I have never lived in. I called life lock and was told I had to call the company that was granted the judgement. Which I did I called Life Lock back and explained it was not me and I was told WELL WE CAN’T HELP EVERYONE. So I think they r full of bull…. ha u get your own agent to work on your case. Lies all lies

Very upset,
Registered on Sunday 26, 2117 then tried to go to customer to add more info and they could not find me.
Went back to register again, said they couldn’t find the original. Started all over and paid for it, never got an email from them. So started today Monday 27th, still no email and still could not find me.
I talked to 5 people today and was disconnected each time right after giving my name. This is not a good start with LIFELOCK. I just want to get this over. Identity stolen last week and LIFELOCK was recommended to me. Please get your phone lines fixed and take care of your customers. STILL WAIITING for email to verify if new enrollment did their job.
FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER.

My house was broken into about 6 months ago and the thieves stole a bunch of papers and stuff with personal information on it. They even got my sons birth certificate! I immediately signed up for LifeLock and have been very happy with the service. Last week I got an alert about someone trying to use my credit at Verizon for something and LifeLock was able to stop it before anything bad could happen. I’m sure this was the same jerk trying to use my name and am so thankful I had LifeLock when he did!

I’ve had Lifelock for about 4 months and am happy with the service so far. Setting up my account was easy and I like the bank account activity alerts that I get emailed to me as well as the free credit score tracking on my account page. Overall, I’m happy with Lifelock’s service.

I’ve been a member for a bit over 2 years. Lots of players in this market but LifeLock has been around the longest with the proven history, the two biggest reasons I went with them over the others. Overall mostly happy with the service, I get notified whenever credit is applied for in my name (ie: I buy a new car/house, or get credit card), when changes are made to my financial accounts, etc.

Even though a little pricey for my budget LifeLock is great for ID Protection (but I guess you get what you pay for). Their website is very user friendly and it’s really easy to set up your accounts. They provide excellent customer service should you have any questions or concerns. In addition to everything else they monitor all your accounts very thoroughly with timely information and updates.

I’ve had LifeLock for almost a year now and am very happy with the service. After having setup all of my account info and personal information in their member portal (which was very easy), its clear their system is keeping track of my transactions and monitoring financial activity by the frequency of alerts they send. However, I do wish they were a little more timely as it sometimes takes a day or two before I receive an alert about a purchase I’ve made.
I haven’t had any issues yet with fraudulent activity to REALLY see what their made of but I’m confident that if something we’re to happen I’d be in good hands with them.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
