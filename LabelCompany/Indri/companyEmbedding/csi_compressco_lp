CSI Compressco LP - Positioned For Growth In 2015 (Even With Low Crude Prices) - CSI Compressco LP (NASDAQ:CCLP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»CSI Compressco LP - Positioned For Growth In 2015 (Even With Low Crude Prices)Mar. 2.15 | About: CSI Compressco (CCLP) Dirk Leach Long only, dividend investing, dividend growth investing, energySummaryThe drilling rig count is dropping rapidly and exploration/production capital expense budgets are shrinking.Crude prices have been trading in a range of $48 to $54 for a barrel of WTI over the last month.While its too early to claim a bottom for crude prices, it is not too early to look for bargains. CSI Compressco LP looks to be one of the bargains.The oil and gas drilling rig count has dropped significantly and continues to drop. Oil and gas (O&G) company capital expenditure (CAPEX) budgets for 2015 have been cut and continue to be cut. Crude oil has been trading in a range over the last month from $48 to $54 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI). While it is too early to claim that a bottom for crude prices has been made, it is not too early to look for bargains in the O&G sector. I believe CSI Compressco LP (NASDAQ: CCLP) is one of those bargain companies with upside potential even with the current low crude oil and natural gas prices. CCLP has significant upside potential when crude oil and/or natural gas prices turn back up.
CSI Compressco LP - The Company
CCLP is a master limited partnership (MLP) that provides compression-based production enhancement services for natural gas and oil production companies. Its production enhancement services are used in both conventional wellhead compression applications and unconventional compression applications. The company's conventional applications include production enhancement for dry gas wells, for liquid-loaded gas wells, and backside auto injection systems for liquid-loaded gas wells. The company's conventional applications are primarily associated with mature gas wells with low formation pressures and on gas wells that have experienced significant production declines. Unconventional compression applications are utilized primarily in connection with oil and liquids production, and include vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. CCLP also provides ongoing well monitoring, automated sand separation, and lubrication and maintenance. In addition, CCLP designs and manufactures compressor units, including natural gas powered GasJack compressors to provide conventional wellhead and unconventional compression services; electric VJack compressors to provide production enhancement services on wells located in mature oil fields; and SuperJack packages to provide artificial lift production enhancement services on vertical and horizontal wells with insufficient reservoir pressure. The company has operations in the United States, Mexico, Canada, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Compressco Partners GP Inc. (GP) serves as the general partner of CCLP. The GP is 100 percent owned by TETRA Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: TTI). The company was formerly known as Compressco Partners, L.P. and changed its name to CSI Compressco LP in December 2014. CSI Compressco LP was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

The figure below represents the ownership structure of CSI Compressco LP. Note that the figure below is prior to the acquisition of Compressor Systems, Inc. (CSI). While the ownership structure is the same, TTI's ownership has been reduced to 46% of CCLP versus the previous 82.5% of Compressco Partners LP.

CSI Compressco LP - Products and Services
CCLP provides a wide range of compressor sizes from 20 HP up to 2370 HP and platforms including small trailer mounted, medium skid mounted, and large fixed compressor installations. CCLP's product line of compressors provides high value added solutions to increase production and recoverable reserves in existing oil and gas wells.
An example is CCLP's GasJack Well Casing Gas System. Prior to the system installation, gas production was 200 Mcf/d and oil production was 80 bopd in the existing well. After CCLP's GasJack Well Casing Gas System, gas production increased to 800 Mcf/d and oil production rose to 150 bopd. The figure below was taken from a CCLP investor presentation on CCLP's product and service offerings and provides a schematic of the CCLP GasJack Well Casing Gas System.

In addition to compressor systems, CCLP provides a full suite of compressor services including engineering, installation, operation, monitoring, repair and maintenance. The CCLP website has a very informative investor presentation PDF that describes in much more detail CCLP's product and services offerings. The presentation can be found here.

I believe there is an important take away here with respect to CCLP's product and service offerings in the current O&G environment. With drilling rigs being laid down and capex budgets being cut, production companies will be looking hard at technologies and applications that will increase production and recoverable reserves on their existing wells. With low crude oil prices, producers will be looking for technologies to squeeze more barrels of oil and more cubic feet of gas from their existing wells. CCLP's products and services help producers do exactly that.
CSL Compressco LP - Past Performance and Forecast
CCLP recently reported on 2014 Q4 and 2014 full year financials and it was a very good quarter. The 2014 Q4 results include a full quarter after the recent acquisition of CSI. Revenue came in at $124.8M beating analyst's expectations by $3.07M. CCLP's EBITDA for 2014 Q4 was $31.3M unadjusted and $33.9M after adjustment for one-time costs of the CSI acquisition. Distributable cash flow (DCF) was $28.4M with a coverage ratio of 1.71. CCLP's compressor fleet utilization increased to 87.7% from 85.9% for 2014 Q3 providing a solid start to 2015. CCLP ended 2014 with $34M in cash and $205M available from their existing credit facility. CCLP grew significantly in 2014 with the acquisition of CSI. The following charts of revenue and EBITDA clearly show the large pop in 2014.
CCLP Revenue Growth

CCLP EBITDA Growth


The 2015 revenue and EBITDA forecasts in the charts above are based on the midpoint of CCLP guidance provided in the 2014 Q4 and full year financials recently reported. The guidance for 2015 provided by CCLP reflects the current O&G low price environment.
The CCLP DCF per limited partner unit is provided in the chart below. Note the 2014 Q4 distribution increase was 5.4% over that provided in 2014 Q3; the 9th consecutive increase in the last 10 quarters.

The growth in unit holder distributions is respectable but modest reflecting CCLPs organic growth and acquisition activity. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since CCLP started paying distributions is 6.6%. For the last 3 years, the distribution CAGR was 7.8%. With the recent CSI acquisition, CCLP effectively doubled its enterprise value to $1.06B and significantly increased its revenue and EBITDA. With a healthy 1.71 distribution coverage ratio, CCLP has room to increase unit holder distributions going forward. While CCLP management has not provided any guidance on unit holder distributions for 2015, the 2015 EBITDA guidance reflects an 8% increase over 2014 Q4. I'm expecting CCLP will share that new wealth with unit holders.
CSI Compressco LP - Financial Health Metrics
CCLP is a relatively new company and has just swallowed a large acquisition in 2014 Q3. I'd expect CCLP to have some debt and they do. However, CCLP's debt is quite manageable. The CCLP debt metrics are as follows.
Long term debt to total capitalization is 0.75. This is a little higher than I'd prefer and reflects the borrowing that CCLP made in its acquisition of CSI. It should be noted that the long term debt number I used was for 2014 Q3 reporting immediately after the CSI acquisition. CCLP has not yet made available their 2014 Q4 or full year balance sheet and so I don't have an updated long term debt number. However, CCLP would have made payments on that debt during the fourth quarter of 2014 and it should be a bit lower than the $509.9M reported in 2014 Q3. Any reduction in long term debt from the $509.9M would improve the 0.75 ratio.
 Long term debt to EBITDA is 3.92. A number below 4 is generally what I look for and CCLP meets that criteria. This metric indicates that CCLP's debt is reasonable compared to their EBITDA. CCLP's EBITDA to interest on debt is 4.42. I generally look for a number north of 3.5 to indicate the company should have no trouble servicing their debt. CCLP easily meets that criteria.
Prospective investors should note that CCLP has yet to achieve an investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody's. CCLP's S&P credit rating is B with a stable outlook. The rating is prior to the acquisition of CSI. Given CCLP is now much larger with growing revenue and EBITDA, it might be time for a review of CCLP's credit rating.
Conclusion
CCLP is well positioned to continue its growth into 2015 even with a lowered drilling rig count and capex budget cuts by O&G exploration and production companies. With the current O&G price environment, CCLP expects EBITDA to grow 8% in 2015. Producers of O&G in this current low price environment will be turning to companies like CCLP to increase both production and recoverable reserves from their existing wells. Any recovery in the price of O&G should result in significant growth opportunity for CCLP. The one area of risk I can see is CCLP's current credit rating though their current acquisition driven debt appears quite manageable.
