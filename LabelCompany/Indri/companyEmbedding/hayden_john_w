John W. Hayden

John Hayden retired from the Midland Company (NASDAQ:MLAN) now owned by Munich Re (Xetra: MUV2.DE) in October, 2010 after nearly 30 years of service, the last 13 as the company's President & CEO. He held the same positions in the Company's wholly-owned specialty property / casualty insurance company, American Modern Insurance Group.

Mr. Hayden began his insurance career at Midland in underwriting, moved on to product design and pricing, then into sales and eventually sales management on his way to becoming the company's Chief Executive. By working his way through the company from the bottom up in this fashion, Mr. Hayden was able to lead the company with a true front-line understanding of the business. Midland achieved unprecedented success under Mr. Hayden's leadership. The company's market capitalization grew from $180 million to $1.35 billion, a compound annual rate of 22%. The company's revenues expanded from $375 million to nearly $1.2 billion, its assets grew from $760 million to $1.7 billion and its pretax profits
grew from $35 million to $120 million. 

Currently, Mr. Hayden leads CJH Consulting. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the E.W.Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP), the Board of Directors of Ohio National Financial Services, and the Executive Committee of CincyTech USA.

Mr. Hayden is a graduate of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He also graduated with an MBA from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.
