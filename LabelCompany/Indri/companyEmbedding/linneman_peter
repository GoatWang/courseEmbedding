Biography[edit]
Linneman grew up in Lima, Ohio and attended Lima Central Catholic High School. He received his bachelor's degree in economics from Ashland University in 1973 and went on to obtain his masters (1976) and Ph.D. (1977) in Economics at the University of Chicago, where he began his teaching career. In his early career, Linneman began doing litigation support work in the field of anti-trust economics, and by the mid 1980s had begun focusing on commercial real estate. He has served on several public company boards, including serving on the Executive Committee of Equity Office Properties, and was chairman of Rockefeller Center Properties, successfully negotiating the foreclosure of its previous owners and its subsequent sale in the mid 1990s. He subsequently founded the Linneman Letter in 2001, a widely subscribed quarterly commercial real estate publication. He has been married to Kathy Linneman since 1973, with no children.
Boards[edit]
Dr. Linneman serves on various Boards including:

Paramount Group Real Estate
Commonwealth Real Estate Investment Trust
Regency Centers
AG Mortgage Investment Trust
Equity One

Philanthropy[edit]
Linneman began "Save a Mind, Give a Choice", a charitable effort as part of the Lewa Conservancy Education outreach in Kenya. This program provides education to orphans and rural poverty children in the area of the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.[4]
