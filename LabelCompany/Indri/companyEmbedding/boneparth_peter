Boneparth: Product Is King in ‚Äô06
Peter Boneparth, chief executive officer of Jones Apparel Group, is ready for a challenging year.






















						By Julee Greenberg¬†on¬†December 7, 2005					


NEW YORK ‚Äî Peter Boneparth, chief executive officer of Jones Apparel Group, is ready for a challenging year.In an effort to improve its overall performance, Jones realigned some key management positions last week. It promoted Lynne Cote to the newly created post of ceo, wholesale sportswear, suits and dresses. Boneparth also promoted Mark Mendelson to chief merchandising officer, better apparel; Susan Metzger to president, sales and marketing, better sportswear, and Gregg Marks to ceo of Jones' suit divisions. Here, Boneparth gives WWD a preview of what he expects will happen in the coming months:WWD: What can we expect to see from Jones in the first half?Peter Boneparth: The first half of '06 is going to be marked by a good deal of uncertainty. There's the consolidation of department stores and lots of closings on the horizon. I feel that we really have a great relationship with Federated and May, so I'm confident that we will do well. Also, we feel very good over the long term about the strength of our brands.WWD: How do you expect to deal with the Federated-May merger?P.B.: The increasing competitiveness at retail, especially with this merger, will only make us faster and more fashion-right. We are working on offering more exclusive product, and coming out of 2006, I see us having a tremendous growth opportunity with Federated. They are looking to do business with those companies that have the kind of back-end support that Jones has, they are getting rid of the unproductive real estate and trying to sell more goods at regular price. I think we are much aligned with them in that regard.WWD: How is the growth of Barneys New York going?P.B.: We are on course with Barneys and very pleased with its performance so far. Now we are executing our plan for more store openings. We really see the Barneys brand as a growth engine. Customers shopping at Barneys are looking for luxury, and I believe that customer isn't as affected by the economy the way other shoppers are. They are not focused on price and have high levels of disposable income as well as net worth. Our biggest challenge here is how do we stay cool while becoming more commercial? With that said, we are not looking to make Barneys the size of Neimans or Saks, but we do want to grow the brand and continue to open more stores.

Peter Boneparth, who resigned Thursday as chief executive, president and a director of Jones Apparel, spent much of his six years at the company diversifying its clothing offerings, including buying Barneys.

Peter Boneparth, the aggressive deal-making chief executive of the Jones Apparel Group,  which owns brands like Anne Klein, Jones New York and Nine West, stepped down yesterday.Jones promoted its chief financial officer, Wesley R. Card, to succeed Mr. Boneparth.Jones did not conduct a search for a new chief executive, people briefed on the change said, indicating to some analysts that the board still intended to sell the company.Jones has been shopped to private equity firms and other potential buyers for more than a year, but no bidder has emerged with a high enough offer for the entire company.Last month, Jones agreed to sell a division, Barneys New York, for about $825 million to Istithmar, the investment arm of the Dubai government. Fast Retailing, a Japanese retail company, has since offered $900 million for Barneys. The contractual terms of the Barneys deal with Istithmar allow Jones to continue considering offers for Barneys and  for the entire company until that deal closes.

Mr. Boneparth and the board have disagreed over the company‚Äôs future for quite some time, and the board decided in March not to renew Mr. Boneparth‚Äôs contract when it expired in 2009. At that time, the board granted him 74,000 additional shares of restricted stock. Continue reading the main story

According to a financial filing yesterday, Mr. Boneparth is leaving the company with stock options and payments through March 2009 that total nearly $17 million.

Wesley Card was named chief executive of Jones Apparel.


A public relations firm for Jones declined to make Mr. Boneparth or Mr. Card available for comment.A former investment banker, Mr. Boneparth, 47, spent much of his six years at Jones diversifying its clothing offerings through acquisitions, including a hostile takeover of the Maxwell Shoe Company, the purchase of Gloria Vanderbilt and, later, Barneys New York. Mr. Boneparth also famously took Polo Ralph Lauren to court in 2003 because of a dispute regarding a licensing deal.In 2004, when Jones bought Barneys for $400 million, Moody‚Äôs Investors Service downgraded the company‚Äôs debt rating and several analysts downgraded Jones stock. Now, that purchase has proved to be a lucrative investment.

‚ÄúBarneys was a great investment for the company,‚Äù said Jennifer Black, president of Jennifer Black & Associates. ‚ÄúTo buy that for $400 million and sell it for possibly $900 million. That‚Äôs pretty nice.‚ÄùAnalysts said Mr. Boneparth had steered Jones through a difficult period in the retail industry as major players consolidated. In 2005, Federated Department Stores, now Macy‚Äôs Inc., paid $11 billion for May Department Stores, owner of Filene‚Äôs, Lord & Taylor and other stores.‚ÄúHe tried to position the organization to grow in a market when its traditional customers were consolidating,‚Äù said Marie T. Driscoll, a director and head of the retail equity group at Standard & Poor‚Äôs Equity Research. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done a fairly good job.‚ÄùMr. Card, 59, the new chief executive, has worked at Jones since 1990. Whether or not there is a sale on the horizon for Jones, analysts said the company should be in good hands with Mr. Card.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sort of the one single executive who understands the inner workings of the company,‚Äù said Todd D. Slater, managing director at Lazard Capital Markets. ‚ÄúHe certainly has the financial acumen to provide leadership on a number of different levels.‚Äù
