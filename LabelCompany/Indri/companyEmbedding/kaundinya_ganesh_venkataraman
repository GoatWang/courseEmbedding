 Educational Background



Graduate Degree 


Massachusetts Institute of Technology

                  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. MIT has five schools and one college, containing a total of 32 academic departments, with a strong emphasis on scientific, engineering, and technological education and research. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, the institute used a polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction. MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.                





 Career History



Co-Founder

                                    2001 - Current                


Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.


                  Momenta is a leader in the analysis, characterization, and design of complex pharmaceutical products. Our scientific foundation is a set of tools and methods that enable one to develop a deep understanding of the links between a compound’s chemical structure, its manufacturing process and its biological function. These innovative tools enable us to develop complex generics and follow-on biologics as well as facilitate the discovery of novel drugs. We believe that by applying our innovative technology to our discovery and development programs, we have the potential to create a robust pipeline of innovative generic and novel drugs.

 

Our success is a result of our committed and talented people. We attract scientists exceptionally skilled in integrating information from diverse technical disciplines and task them with challenging characterization, process, and biology problems. Using this approach, we have designed tools and methods to understand the structure (characterization of chemical components), structure-process (design and control of manufacturing process) and structure-activity (relationships between structure and biological and clinical activity) of complex mixture drugs. From this knowledge comes a diversified product development pipeline consisting of both generic and novel complex mixture drugs designed to address a variety of medical needs.

 

In July 2010, Momenta announced the FDA approval of our first drug, enoxaparin sodium injection developed in collaboration with Sandoz. Enoxaparin is a more affordable, generic version of Lovenox® (enoxaparin sodium injection), which is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Enoxaparin sodium injection is a heparin-based complex mixture drug that was developed using our innovative scientific approach. Following this initial success, we are applying a similar approach to developing a generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate), a complex mixture of polypeptides indicated for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We are also adding follow-on biologics, which are highly similar and potentially interchangeable biologics, to our development pipeline. And finally, with the knowledge acquired from our complex generic and follow-on biologics business, we are our using our tools and technology to design and improve the structures of proteins and heparin-derived products to create novel drugs                




BioInformatics Director

                                    1995 - 2000                


Harvard University


                  Harvard was established in 1636, and it is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. The University, which is based in Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts, has an enrollment of over 20,000 degree candidates, including undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The University has twelve degree-granting Schools in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
