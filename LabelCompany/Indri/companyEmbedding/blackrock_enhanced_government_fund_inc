Overview






Investment Approach
The Fund’s investment objective is to provide shareholders with current income and gains. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by
investing primarily in a portfolio of US Government securities and US Government Agency securities, including US Government mortgage-backed
securities that pay interest in an attempt to generate current income, and by employing a strategy of writing (selling) call options on individual or
baskets of US Government securities, US Government Agency securities or other debt securities held by the Fund in an attempt to generate gains
from option premiums.
No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward.

Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.





Negative weightings may result from specific circumstances (including timing differences between trade and settle dates of securities purchased by the funds) and/or the use of certain financial instruments, including derivatives, which may be used to gain or reduce market exposure and/or risk management.

Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

BlackRock Enhanced Government Fund, Inc. Announces Expiration of 
      Annual Repurchase Offer






November 22, 2016 06:15 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Enhanced Government Fund, Inc. (the “Fund”) (NYSE:EGF, CUSIP: 
      09255K108) announced the expiration of the Fund’s annual repurchase 
      offer for its shares of common stock (the “Repurchase Offer”). The 
      Repurchase Offer and withdrawal rights expired at 5:00 p.m., Eastern 
      Time, on November 22, 2016. The Fund offered to repurchase up to 10% of 
      its outstanding shares of common stock (the “Shares”) for cash at a 
      price equal to the net asset value of the Shares as of the close of 
      regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on December 6, 2016, 
      subject to a repurchase fee of 2% of the value of the Shares 
      repurchased, which will be deducted from the repurchase price. As of 
      Tuesday, November 22, 2016, 7,216,866 Shares of the Fund were 
      outstanding. A repurchase amount of 10% of the Shares outstanding as of 
      November 22, 2016 would represent approximately 721,686 Shares.
    

      The preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's 
      depositary agent, indicated that approximately 4,997,098 Shares 
      (approximately 69% of the Fund's Shares outstanding as of November 22, 
      2016) were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of 
      the Fund's Repurchase Offer. This determination is subject to final 
      confirmation and the proper delivery of all Shares tendered and not 
      withdrawn.
    

      Because the aggregate number of Shares tendered and not withdrawn 
      exceeds the total number of Shares that the Fund offered to repurchase, 
      the Fund will repurchase any Shares tendered on a pro rata basis. 
      However, the Fund will accept all Shares tendered by shareholders who 
      own, beneficially or of record, an aggregate of not more than 99 Shares 
      and who tender all of their Shares, before pro rating Shares tendered by 
      others.
    

      The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The 
      Fund’s investment objective is to provide stockholders with current 
      income and gains.
    

      None of the Fund, its investment adviser or its Board of Directors has 
      made any recommendation to any stockholder as to whether to tender or 
      refrain from tendering Shares in the Repurchase Offer.
    

      For client-specific information regarding the Repurchase Offer, please 
      contact your broker or financial advisor, or in the case of registered 
      stockholders, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., which is acting as the 
      depositary agent in connection with the Repurchase Offer.

      those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could 
      differ materially from historical performance.
    

      With respect to the Fund, the following factors, among others, could 
      cause actual events to differ materially from forward-looking statements 
      or historical performance: (1) changes and volatility in political, 
      economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign 
      exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in 
      changes in demand for the Funds or in a Fund’s net asset value; (2) the 
      relative and absolute investment performance of a Fund and its 
      investments; (3) the impact of increased competition; (4) the 
      unfavorable resolution of any legal proceedings; (5) the extent and 
      timing of any distributions or share repurchases; (6) the impact, extent 
      and timing of technological changes; (7) the impact of legislative and

      Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and regulatory, supervisory or 
      enforcement actions of government agencies relating to a Fund or 
      BlackRock, as applicable; (8) terrorist activities, international 
      hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the 
      general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, 
      specific industries or BlackRock; (9) BlackRock’s ability to attract and 
      retain highly talented professionals; (10) the impact of BlackRock
