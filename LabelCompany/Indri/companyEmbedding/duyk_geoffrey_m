Public schools in the state of Alabama may qualify for grant funding. This grant will cover the cost of a one-day field trip experience, which includes laboratory supplies and catered box lunches for up to 32 students and 3 chaperones.  Additional chaperones may attend at a cost of $8.75 each for lunch. To qualify for funding, a minimum time of 3 hours is required for middle school groups and 4 hours for high school groups. There is a limited amount of funding available to public schools in the state of Alabama for each school year. Once funding is exhausted, schools can still schedule field trips at cost.

Leif Andersson, PhD



professor in functional genomics in the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology at Uppsala University, Sweden, and winner of the 2014 Wolf Prize in Agriculture.
Leif was among the first scientists worldwide to apply molecular genetics to domestic animals. At the time, in the late 1980s, this involved identifying one gene at a time: an enormously laborious task. It was hard to get funding as well. The research councils considered that genetic research was most suitably carried out on mice, yeast and banana flies, rather than horses and pigs. But he stuck to his idea, and the discoveries and publications soon ensued.

Deborah Nickerson, PhD



professor, University of Washington and Associate Director of the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine, Professor of Genome Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Bioengineering, NWIGM: Genomic Technologies
Debbie Nickerson, Associate Director of the NWIGM, is focused on the application of genomic technologies. Dr. Nickerson is a Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington (UW), who, for two decades, has pioneered the development of new methods and tools that have been widely adopted for the identification and genotyping of human sequence variation, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertion-deletions (indels) and copy number variations (CNVs). Her recent work has focused on developing and applying robust methods for next-generation sequencing technology.

Barbara Wold, PhD



Director of the Beckman Institute, and Professor of Molecular Biology, California Institute of TechnologyDr. Barbara Wold is the Bren professor of molecular biology and director of the Beckman Institute at Caltech. She began working on genome structure and gene regulation during embryo development for her Ph.D. thesis at Caltech, and developed ways to assay cis-regulatory element function during postdoctoral work at Columbia. She joined the biology faculty at Caltech in 1981 where she and her colleagues have focused on learning the architecture and logic of gene networks that drive cell state transitions. They study skeletal muscle development, degeneration and regeneration as a favored model system. Recent work emphasizes new ways to quantitatively map the inputs and outputs of gene networks in a genome-wide manner using “next generation” ultra-high throughput DNA sequencing, and applying these methods to muscle and brain networks.http://biofrontiers.colorado.edu/about/directory/BarbaraWold

Val Sheffield, MD, PhD



Howard Hughes Medical Investigator, and Director of the Division of Medical Genetics at the University of IowaInvestigator, Howard Hughes Medical InstituteProfessor, Department of PediatricsDirector, Division of Medical GeneticsDirector, Interdepartmental Research Program in Human Molecular Genetics, University of IowaDr. Sheffield received his bachelor of science degree in zoology from Brigham Young University and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago. Dr. Sheffield completed a pediatric residency, a medical genetics fellowship and postdoctoral work at the University of California, San Francisco.Dr. Sheffield is interested in identifying genes and disease mechanisms involved in single-gene and complex human genetic disorders, including hereditary blindness, deafness, autism, obesity, and cardiovascular disorders. The identification of genes, sequence variations, and mechanisms involved in complex human disorders holds great promise for improving health care, but at the same time presents a difficult challenge to the scientific community.To better understand the genetics of complex human disorders, Dr. Sheffield’s laboratory has studied isolated human populations and Mendelian (single-gene) disorders that share a phenotypic component with common complex disorders. He has used isolated human populations to map more than 35 disorders and has used positional cloning methods to identify 15 disease-causing genes. This work has provided insight into the types of genes, mutational events and gene product interactions that are likely to contribute to common complex disorders. Recent progress in the laboratory has resulted in the identification of genes involved in a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder known as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Most recently Dr. Sheffield’s lab identified defects in a single gene that underlies a hereditary form of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world.http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/val-c-sheffield
