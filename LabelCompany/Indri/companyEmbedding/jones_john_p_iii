New head takes over at Air Products - tribunedigital-mcall






 


 Home→Collections→EngineeringNew head takes over at Air ProductsJohn P. Jones III has spent 28 years at Trexlertown maker of industrial gases.December 03, 2000|By DAN SHOPE Of The Morning CallWhen John P. Jones III arrived at Air Products and Chemicals Inc. 28 years ago, he found a gentleman standing in front of a newspaper machine in the corporate headquarters in Trexlertown.That gentleman was Leonard P. Poole, founder of the company."It was 10 p.m., and this fellow I didn't know was also trying to buy The Morning Call," Jones said. "There was only one left in the machine, and I'd already put my quarter in first. I offered the paper to him."FOR THE RECORD - (Published Tuesday, December 5, 2000) Leonard P. Pool was founder of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. His name was misspelled in a story Sunday in the business section.Poole must have been impressed.Before he died in 1975, Poole sent Jones to Brazil to build a major industrial gas plant. Jones was just 22 years old, a recent engineering graduate from Villanova."He told me, "We know you don't have a lot of experience, but you can ask a lot of questions and figure it out."'That faith in people was Leonard Poole's philosophy, and one Jones says he hopes to foster at Air Products.On Friday, Jones, 49, officially gained Poole's old post as leader of Air Products. He replaced the retiring Harold "Hap" Wagner, 65, as chairman, president and chief executive of the company.Jones became the fifth chief executive in the company's history.But before discussing the company's future during an interview in his office last week, he remembered how he started with Air Products -- the only company he's ever worked for."When I came here in 1972, we were a $300 million business, with 90 percent of the business in the United States," Jones said.Today, Air Products has sales of $5 billion with operations in more than 30 countries. It employs 17,000 people worldwide, and about 5,000 in the Lehigh Valley region.In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the company earned $532.6 million with special items excluded, an 18 percent increase over the previous year."They always allowed me to do unique things," he said. "They had faith in a 22-year-old building a plant."In his chemical engineering class in college Jones was voted "least likely to survive in a corporation," he said.But he was soon swimming at Air Products.A native of Blakely, Lackawanna County, Jones never heard of Air Products until he was near graduation from college. But he's had a whirlwind career since.He's served with the joint-venture International Coal Refining Co.; the company's former engineering group, Stearns Catalytic World Corp; Environmental and Energy Systems; Process Systems Group; and Air Products Europe.Over the last two years he's worked as the company's president and chief operating officer and learned from his predecessor, Wagner, who had held the post since 1992.It was Wagner who introduced him to Wall Street, at a time when Air Products was attempting a takeover of British-based BOC Group.The deal, blocked by antitrust regulators, would have made Air Products the world's second-largest industrial gas company. Instead, it remained No. 4 and the dead deal cost the company $456.5 million."We were bringing technical capability to the deal, and BOC had infrastructure, which would help us grow faster in Asia," Jones said. "The way I look at it now, I'd rather have the technology if I had to make the choice."Many industry analysts were happy the deal fell apart and are welcoming Jones to his new post."Wall Street regards Jones as positive," said industry analyst Donald P. Carson of JP Morgan Securities. "He has a lot of experience and brings with him a new strategy for chemicals, which don't naturally tie into the gas side of the company."His strategy is in the electronics chemicals area, which brings the chemicals and gas together."Carson said he didn't like the BOC merger."BOC was overpriced and Air Products was using equities to fund it," Carson said. "The day the deal was canceled, the stock price went up 20 percent. So the Federal Trade Commission actually did a great job for the investors."With the collapse of the BOC's deal in May, Air Products' stock's price has improved from about $23 per share in April to $40 per share in October. Currently, the stock has been trading at about $34 per share on the New York Stock Exchange."Most important is that things change and they keep changing," Jones said. That's been true in the chemicals part of the business in recent years."For instance, we are part of the chemical sector, which in 1990 was 5 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. In 1995 it was 3 percent and today is nine-tenths of a percent."I look to return-on-capital and earnings growth. And no surprises."Jones said Air Products is the only major company that combines the industrial gas and chemicals businesses, which allows him to approach Wall Street analysts in a different way from competitors."It's made us strong in electronics," he said. "Because we have a chemicals business, we are the only industrial gas company that has NF3 -- nitrogen triflouride."Jones said he had fun during his latest trip to New York. There, he advised analysts to buy a product that Air Products helped create -- Sony Playstation 2.1 | 2 |  Next
