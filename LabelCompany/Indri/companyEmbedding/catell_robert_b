Product Description

 
Description
In a business era in which executives are taken away in handcuffs and corporate malfeasance and scandal dominates the business headlines, there is tremendous value in the stories of ethical companies and spiritual business leaders.The CEO and the Monk is one such compelling story, the story of KeySpan, the nation?s fifth largest energy giant and a profitable, Fortune 500 company, and the two KeySpan executives?one a former monk?whose unique working relationship is based on something as simple and powerful as “doing the right thing.” This isn?t yet another prescriptive business guide written by breathless consultants. It is a story about a real business and how two unusual and dedicated humanists can keep their eyes on profits and ethics at the same time.
