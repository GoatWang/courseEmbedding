Assignment Record– Rev. G.R. Keith Albrecht

Summary of Case: G.R. Keith Albrecht was was ordained for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati in 1977. Prior to that, in the early 1970s, he was a Franciscan friar preparing for solemn vows when the Order voted him out. As a Cincinnati archdiocesan priest, Albrecht assisted in parishes in Beavercreek, Xenia, and Coldwater OH, where he was named pastor in 1987. He  also spent a year as a hospital chaplain in Dayton. 

      In 1986 Albrecht took nude photos of a "young man," who then tried to blackmail him for money. Despite knowledge of this incident, the archdiocese elevated him to pastor the following year. In 1993 Albrecht was placed on leave after a man alleged molestation as a minor by Albrecht in the 1970s in Beavercreek. A second person subsequently came forward with allegations that Albrecht had molested him when he was an 8th grader in the late 1980s, during a trip with the priest to New York.  Albrecht admitted to sexual behavior with youths, explaining that he thought he was acting "out of love." He would reach out to troubled adolescent males, then molest them. At least two lived with him for a time in the rectory of his Coldwater parish. In 2004 a man filed suit against Albrecht and the archdiocese with claims of abuse 1977-1981, when the man was a 14 to 17-year-old boy. The suit was dismissed in 2006 due to a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that victims must file suit before the age of 20. Albrecht was laicized in 2005.

Priests in a Parish: We use the following 
      convention to show a priest's place among the clergy of a parish: 1/2 means 
      that he is the first priest listed in the Official Catholic Directory (usually 
      the pastor) and that there is a total of two priests at the parish. The shorthand 
      3/4 means that the priest is listed third on a four-priest roster. See our sample 
        page from the Directory.

Note: The 
        Official Catholic Directory aims to report the whereabouts of Catholic 
        priests in the United States on January 1 of the Directory's publication 
        year. Our working assumption is that a priest listed in the Directory 
        for a given year was at the same assignment for part of the previous year 
        as well. However, Kenedy and Sons will sometimes accept updates well into 
        the year of publication. Diocesan clergy records are rarely available to 
        correct this information. The Directory is also sometimes misleading 
        or wrong. We have tried to create an accurate assignment record, given the 
        source materials and their limitations. Assignment records are a work in 
        progress and we are always improving the records that we post. Please email 
          us with new information and corrections.

        This assignment record collates Albrecht's career history as it is represented 
        in the Official Catholic Directory with the allegations against him, as reported in 
        the media. We make no representation regarding the truth of the allegations 
        we report, and we remind our readers that the U.S. legal system presumes 
        that a person accused of or charged with a crime is innocent until proven 
        guilty. Similarly, individuals who may be defendants in civil actions are 
        presumed not to be liable for such claims unless a plaintiff proves otherwise. 
        Admissions of guilt or liability are not typically a part of civil or private 
        settlements. For more information, see our posting 
          policy.

        This assignment record was last updated on August 23, 2016.

Testimonials



"After contacting 5 other real estate agents in the Carmel area, we chose the Albrecht Team for one reason: Keith was willing to be aggressive in pricing our beautiful home."


"The Albrecht Team put together a fantastic marketing brochure for our home, and within 5 days we had 10 showings. In ten days, we received an excellent offer! In fact, the final contract price was well above where the 'other' realtors wanted us to start pricing!"


"There's no question in my mind that, had we chosen a less experienced, less capable realtor, things would not have gone so smoothly - and we wouldn't have received such a great price for our home."–Kathleen M.


"Keith was an excellent Realtor.  He worked hard to get our house sold and we had many prospects looking at our house. We had one deal fall through but not due to anything The Albrecht Team did. In fact, the buyer got a very poor inspection and Keith's team did everything they could to work with them but it didn't happen.  I was very happy with The Albrecht Team and if you want to get your house sold, use them!"–Jeff K.


"The Albrecht Team will always remembered as the group that helped me become a first time home buyer...With the hours that I work, and the fact that I was in need of someone to do the leg work for me. This process with the Albrecht Team was a breeze."–Bret H.


"They were professional in all the services they performed especially in the photography of the home for the web as well as pricing the home for sale.  Follow-up by staff all the way to the morning of the closing was excellent."–Anthony S.


"...Communication has been by phone, email, in person and in the office with wonderful customer service and professionalism with each and every .  Calls have always been returned promptly. The posting went live one week ago today and we will have a signed lease in the morning!  We could not be more pleased with our experience with The Albrecht Team - ReMax Real Estate Group.  We highly recommend this professional, expert Team to assist you in any of your Real Estate needs."–Jeannine A.


"Keith is great at what he does and listens to his clients. I would use Keith and his team again in the future (we have already used him twice). The process of selling our home and buying another was stressful, but the Albrecht team did a great job of helping us through all that needed to be done."


"The team does a great job of listening to their clients. The team was efficient in getting photos online, home info, contracts, HOA details, etc.  Our story is the ideal one, we closed on our old home and our new home in less than a monthâ€™s time. Not everyone can be so lucky, but I think our story proves how well the Albrecht team works. It's a well-oiled machine."–Larry C.


"...Keith gave us good guidance as he negotiated for us to get the best price and our house sold quicker than we expected!  There is definitely a difference in the service when you work with an experienced agent who has sold a lot of houses!"–Cindy S.


"...Keith was very knowledgeable and gave me his honest opinions on sale price, time-frame and what I had to do to sell my home as quickly as possible and for the price I was looking for. His team was very responsive to any questions I had, and helped me understand and navigate the process when we did get an offer. He made this process so much easier than my husband and I anticipated. We will be using Keith and his team for any future real estate needs!"–Cindy S.
