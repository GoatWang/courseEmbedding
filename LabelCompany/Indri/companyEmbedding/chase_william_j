Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1854 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: New York, Redfield 137 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 452219914

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1854 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: New York, Redfield 235 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 452296170

Description












                                            Blending narrative and translated Soviet documents, William Chase tells a story of idealism betrayed, of how the Comintern (the Communist International, an organization established by Lenin in 1919 to direct and assist revolutionary movements throughout the world) participated in but was ultimately destroyed by Stalinist repression in the late 1930s. Chase analyzes the Comintern's roles as agent, instrument, and victim of terror."This book is about an extraordinary group of people at an extraordinary time caught up in a life and death struggle. The documents show bluntly and brutally how the Russian Revolution under Stalin ate its own children."�Ronald Grigor Suny
