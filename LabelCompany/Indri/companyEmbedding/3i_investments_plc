Partnering for international growth
We provide investment solutions for growing companies. Access to both 3i’s balance sheet and external capital allows us significant flexibility in how we finance deals and the length of our investment hold period.
Our investment strategy 

We back entrepreneurs and  management teams of mid-market companies with an EV typically between €100m –  €500m.
We back international growth  plans, providing access to our network and expertise to accelerate growth.  
We look for situations where  there are structural opportunities to enhance and drive value growth, e.g.  expanding sales into new regions, buy-and-build opportunities, offshoring manufacturing  and sourcing international suppliers.  
We focus on three core sectors:  consumer, business & technology services and  industrial. In each we have a proven track record and a deep  international network of contacts.

3i founded with £15m of capital





Foundation of 3i
The 1931 MacMillan Committee Report identified a "MacMillan Gap"; a chronic shortage of long-term investment capital for small and medium-sized businesses. It recommended the formation of a company "to devote itself particularly to these smaller industrial and commercial issues". This company would, in addition to its ordinary capital, issue preference share capital backed by the debentures or shares of the companies which it financed and therefore serve as an intermediary between small investors and small and medium-sized industrial borrowers.
Hence, 3i's roots were laid through the establishment of ICFC (Industrial and Commercial Financial Corporation) and the FCI (Finance Corporation for Industry) in 1945 under the UK's labour government led by Clement Atlee following the second world war. The ICFC was established to serve small and medium sized businesses through the provision of long term and permanent capital (typical investments of £5,000-£200,000). It was exclusively funded by the major clearing banks and the Bank of England, who collectively agreed to provide share and loan capital up to £45m, led by Lord William Piercy as its first Chairman. In the same year, the FCI was founded with £25m of capital and the ability to borrow a further £100m. Share capital was subscribed by insurance companies, investment trust companies and the Bank of England with a remit to provide capital (principally in the form of debt) in larger amounts than the ICFC to facilitate the rationalisation and restructuring of key sectors of British industry and for post-war re-equipment.
The 1970s saw the merger of the FCI and ICFC forming "Finance for Industry" (FFI), which during the 1980s was rebranded to "Investors in Industry" and later in July 1994, at the time of its London Stock Exchange flotation and entry into the FTSE100, became "3i" as we know it today.

Infrastructure




Investing in mid-market economic infrastructure businesses, and greenfield and low-risk energy projects in developed markets, principally in Europe
Infrastructure was set up as a discrete business line within 3i in 2006, when we, in consortium with three other international investors, led the public-to-private acquisition of Anglian Water Group.
Our Infrastructure business has evolved significantly since then. At 31 March 2017, it had assets under management of £2.9 billion.
Growing our Infrastructure business is an important strategic priority for us, and in November 2013 we completed the acquisition of Barclays Infrastructure Funds Management Limited from Barclays Bank plc.
As the infrastructure investment team grows, we expect to continue to enhance both our investment and support capabilities.

Partnering for international growth
We provide investment solutions for growing companies. Access to both 3i’s balance sheet and external capital allows us significant flexibility in how we finance deals and the length of our investment hold period.
Our investment strategy 

We back entrepreneurs and  management teams of mid-market companies with an EV typically between €100m –  €500m.
We back international growth  plans, providing access to our network and expertise to accelerate growth.  
We look for situations where  there are structural opportunities to enhance and drive value growth, e.g.  expanding sales into new regions, buy-and-build opportunities, offshoring manufacturing  and sourcing international suppliers.  
We focus on three core sectors:  consumer, business & technology services and  industrial. In each we have a proven track record and a deep  international network of contacts.

History[edit]
The company was formed in 1945, as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), by the Bank of England and the major British banks to provide long-term investment funding for small and medium-sized enterprises. Its foundation was inspired by the Macmillan Committee, and resulted from the recognition in the 1930s, given new impetus in the postwar era, that smaller businesses faced a gap in available corporate finance due to banks being unwilling to provide long-term capital and the companies being too small to raise capital from the public markets.
During the 1950s and 1960s, and particularly after 1959 when the shareholder banks allowed it to raise external funds, ICFC expanded to become the largest provider of growth capital for unquoted companies in the United Kingdom. In 1973 ICFC acquired Finance Corporation for Industry, a sister company also formed in 1945 which focused on finance for large companies, and was renamed Finance for Industry (FFI). In the 1980s FFI became a leading provider of finance for management buyouts, and expanded internationally. In 1983 the company was renamed Investors in Industry, commonly known as 3i.
3i Group was created in 1987 when the banks sold off their stakes to form a public limited company. In 1994 the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of £1.5 billion.[4]
Operations[edit]
3i invests in mid-market buyouts, growth capital (minority) and infrastructure. Sectors invested in are business and financial services, consumer, industrials and energy, and healthcare.
Current investments include:

ACR Capital Reinsurance: 3i bought into this re-insurance business in 2006.[5]
Action: in June 2011 3i bought a majority stake in this Dutch discount retailer.[6]
Agent Provocateur: in November 2007 3i acquired the lingerie business.[7]
Element Materials Technology: 3i announced the acquisition of the materials and testing group of Stork B.V. in November 2010.[8]
Foster and Partners: 3i acquired a minority (growth capital) stake in the architecture practice in May 2007. This was bought back by the practice in June 2014 to become wholly owned by the 140 partners.[9]
Mémora Servicios Funerarias: 3i bought into this Spanish funeral service provider in 2008.[10] It sold it to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in 2017.[11]
Scandlines: 3i have had 100% ownership of Scandlines since November 2013.[12]
Q Holding Co: 3i are due to purchase the company's three main operating businesses, Qure Medical, QSR and Quadra Tooling and Automation.[13]
Weener Plastic Packaging Group: in June 2015 3i announced an investment in Weener Plastic Packaging Group[14]
Formel D: In 2017, 3i invested €155 million in Formel D, a German car parts company, while CITIC invested €72 million.[11]

History[edit]
The company was formed in 1945, as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), by the Bank of England and the major British banks to provide long-term investment funding for small and medium-sized enterprises. Its foundation was inspired by the Macmillan Committee, and resulted from the recognition in the 1930s, given new impetus in the postwar era, that smaller businesses faced a gap in available corporate finance due to banks being unwilling to provide long-term capital and the companies being too small to raise capital from the public markets.
During the 1950s and 1960s, and particularly after 1959 when the shareholder banks allowed it to raise external funds, ICFC expanded to become the largest provider of growth capital for unquoted companies in the United Kingdom. In 1973 ICFC acquired Finance Corporation for Industry, a sister company also formed in 1945 which focused on finance for large companies, and was renamed Finance for Industry (FFI). In the 1980s FFI became a leading provider of finance for management buyouts, and expanded internationally. In 1983 the company was renamed Investors in Industry, commonly known as 3i.
3i Group was created in 1987 when the banks sold off their stakes to form a public limited company. In 1994 the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of £1.5 billion.[4]
Operations[edit]
3i invests in mid-market buyouts, growth capital (minority) and infrastructure. Sectors invested in are business and financial services, consumer, industrials and energy, and healthcare.
Current investments include:

ACR Capital Reinsurance: 3i bought into this re-insurance business in 2006.[5]
Action: in June 2011 3i bought a majority stake in this Dutch discount retailer.[6]
Agent Provocateur: in November 2007 3i acquired the lingerie business.[7]
Element Materials Technology: 3i announced the acquisition of the materials and testing group of Stork B.V. in November 2010.[8]
Foster and Partners: 3i acquired a minority (growth capital) stake in the architecture practice in May 2007. This was bought back by the practice in June 2014 to become wholly owned by the 140 partners.[9]
Mémora Servicios Funerarias: 3i bought into this Spanish funeral service provider in 2008.[10] It sold it to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in 2017.[11]

Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
