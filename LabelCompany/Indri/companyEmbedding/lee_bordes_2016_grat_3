	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) using
	a shelf registration process, to permit the holders named in the section entitled Selling Stockholders to resell shares of our Class A common stock in a registered offering, as described under Plan of
	Distribution. Under this shelf registration process, the selling stockholders from time to time may offer and sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings or resales. This prospectus provides you with a general description of the
	shares of common stock the selling stockholders may offer. Under the shelf process, in certain circumstances, we may provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of a particular offering by the selling
	stockholders. We may also authorize one or more free writing prospectuses to be provided to you that may contain material information relating to these offerings. Any prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this
	prospectus with respect to that offering. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, you should rely on the prospectus supplement. Before purchasing any securities, you should
	carefully read both this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement, together with the additional information described under the heading Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference.


	Neither we, nor the selling stockholders, have authorized anyone to provide you with any information or to make any representations other than
	those contained in this prospectus, any applicable prospectus supplement or any free writing prospectuses prepared by or on behalf of us or to which we have referred you. We and the selling stockholders take no responsibility for, and can provide no
	assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. We and the selling stockholders will not make an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should not assume
	that the information incorporated by reference or provided in this prospectus or any applicable prospectus supplement or any free writing prospectus prepared by us is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of those documents.
	Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since those dates.


	When we refer to
	Beasley, we, our, us and the Company in this prospectus, we mean Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.

	ABOUT THE COMPANY



	We are a radio broadcasting company whose primary business is operating radio stations throughout the United States. Inclusive of announced
	divestitures, we own and operate 69 radio stations in the following radio markets: Atlanta, GA, Augusta, GA, Boston, MA, Charlotte, NC, Detroit, MI, Fayetteville, NC, Fort Myers-Naples, FL, Greenville-New Bern-Jacksonville, NC, Las Vegas, NV,
	Philadelphia, PA, Middlesex, NJ, Monmouth, NJ, Morristown, NJ, Tampa-Saint Petersburg, FL, West Palm Beach-Boca Raton, FL, and Wilmington, DE.


	We seek to secure and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve by developing market-leading clusters of radio stations in each
	of our markets. We operate our radio stations in clusters to capture a variety of demographic listener groups, which we believe enhances our radio stations appeal to a wide range of advertisers. In addition, we have been able to achieve
	operating efficiencies by consolidating office and studio space where possible to minimize duplicative management positions and reduce overhead expenses.


	On November 1, 2016 we completed our merger with Greater Media, Inc. (Greater Media) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
	Merger (the Merger Agreement) dated July 19, 2016, under which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Greater Media for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $240 million, subject to a purchase price
	adjustment related to the sale of Greater Medias tower assets and other customary post-closing purchase price adjustments and inclusive of the repayment of approximately $82 million of Greater Medias outstanding debt and the payment of
	certain transaction expenses (the Merger). The proceeds paid to the stockholders of Greater Media in the Merger consisted of (i) approximately $94.4 million in cash and (ii) $25 million in shares of the Companys
	Class A common stock, which is equal to 5,422,993 shares at a fixed value of $4.61 per share.


	The selling stockholders listed in
	this prospectus are former stockholders of Greater Media that received shares of the Companys Class A common stock as a result of the Merger. At the closing of the Merger, the Company


	 


	3






	Table of Contents



	entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with such stockholders and BFTW LLC (the Registration Rights Agreement), requiring the Company, not later than twenty days following the
	closing of the Merger, to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC with respect to the resale of the shares of the Companys Class A common stock received by such stockholders in the Merger. In addition, such
	stockholders are entitled to unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to the registration of any equity securities of the Company, subject to certain limitations.


	These registration rights are subject to conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters of an offering to limit the
	number of shares held by such selling stockholders to be included in such offering. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company is generally required to bear all expenses of registration (other than underwriting discounts and commissions and certain
	travel expenses). The Registration Rights Agreement also places indemnity obligations on the Company, to indemnify the selling stockholders, under certain circumstances, and on the selling stockholders, to indemnify the Company under certain
	circumstances.








	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This registration statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
	of 1995, which relate to future, not past, events. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations
	of the Companys management and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Words or expressions such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes,
	estimates, may, will, plans, projects, could, should, would, seek, forecast, or other similar expressions help identify
	forward-looking statements.


	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
	Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material. Readers
	are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company and Greater Media undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.


	Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results or events may differ materially from those
	projected or implied in those statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

	the risk that any identifiable intangible assets recorded due to the acquisition of Greater Media could become impaired;




	 




	 


	


	 


	external economic forces that could have a material adverse impact on the Companys advertising revenues and results of operations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the ability of the Companys radio stations to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues and respond to changes in technology, standards and services that affect the radio industry;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Companys substantial debt levels;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the loss of key personnel; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	other economic, business, competitive, and regulatory factors affecting the businesses of the Company and Greater Media generally, including those set forth in the Companys filings with the SEC.




	All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or Greater Media or persons acting on behalf of the Company or
	Greater Media are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. For additional information with respect to these factors, please see the section entitled Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference beginning

	RISK FACTORS



	An investment in our Class A common stock involves significant risks. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
	be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Before you make an investment decision regarding the
	securities, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors in any applicable prospectus supplement and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in any updates to those Risk Factors in our
	Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, together with all of the other information appearing in this prospectus or incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement, in light of your particular investment objectives and
	financial circumstances. The risks described in those documents are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations, our
	financial results and the value of the securities.

	disposing of their shares. We will bear all other costs, fees and expenses incurred in effecting the registration of the shares covered by this prospectus, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, NASDAQ Global Market listing

	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS



	We are registering the resale from time to time by the selling stockholders of up to 5,422,993 shares of our Class A common stock
	(collectively referred to as the selling stockholders) in one or more offerings. The selling stockholders acquired the shares of Class A common stock owned by them in connection with the Merger described above under the heading
	About the Company.


	The following table sets forth certain information as of November 18, 2016 regarding the beneficial
	ownership of our Class A common stock by the selling stockholders named in the table below, who may offer, in the aggregate, up to 5,422,993 shares of our Class A common stock. We do not know if, when or in what amounts the selling
	stockholders may offer their shares for sale. The selling stockholders may sell some, all or none of the shares held by them. The selling stockholders reserve the right to accept or reject, in whole or in part, any proposed sale of any shares of our
	Class A common stock currently held by the selling stockholders. Because the number of shares the selling stockholders may offer and sell is not presently known, we cannot estimate the number of shares that will continue to be held by the
	selling stockholders. This table, however, presents the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock that each selling stockholder may offer pursuant to this prospectus and the number of shares of Class A common stock, if any, that
	each selling stockholder would beneficially own after the sale of such maximum number of shares, assuming no acquisitions of additional shares of Class A common stock take place.


	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d) of the Exchange Act and includes voting or investment power with respect
	to our securities.

	Offers to purchase the
	Class A common stock being offered by this prospectus may be solicited directly. Agents may also be designated to solicit offers to purchase the Class A common stock from time to time. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of our
	Class A common stock will be identified in a prospectus supplement.

	Table of Contents



	If a dealer is utilized in the sale of the Class A common stock being offered by this
	prospectus, the Class A common stock will be sold to the dealer, as principal. The dealer may then resell the Class A common stock to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale.


	If an underwriter is utilized in the sale of the Class A common stock being offered by this prospectus, an underwriting agreement will be
	executed with the underwriter at the time of sale and the name of any underwriter will be provided in the prospectus supplement that the underwriter will use to make resales of the Class A common stock to the public. In connection with the sale
	of the Class A common stock, the selling stockholders, or the purchasers of Class A common stock for whom the underwriter may act as agent, may compensate the underwriter in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions. The
	underwriter may sell the Class A common stock to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for which they may
	act as agent. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement, an agent will be acting on a best efforts basis and a dealer will purchase securities as a principal, and may then resell the securities at varying prices to be determined by the
	dealer.


	Any compensation paid to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the Class A common stock, and
	any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, if required. Underwriters, dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the Class A
	common stock may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the Class A common stock may be deemed to be underwriting
	discounts and commissions. We may enter into agreements to indemnify underwriters, dealers and agents against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments they may be required to make in respect
	thereof and to reimburse those persons for certain expenses.


	The selling stockholders may sell shares of the Class A common stock
	directly to purchasers. In this case, they may not engage underwriters or agents in the offer and sale of such shares.


	To facilitate the
	offering of securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the
	securities, which involve the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than were sold to them. In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by making purchases in the open market
	or by exercising their over-allotment option, if any. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the Class A common stock by bidding for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby
	selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the
	market price of the Class A common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time.


	The specific terms of any lock-up provisions in respect of any given offering will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	The underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions with us, or perform services for us, in the ordinary course of business for
	which they receive compensation.


	We are not aware of any plans, arrangements or understandings between any of the selling stockholders
	and any underwriter, broker-dealer or agent regarding the sale of shares of our Class A common stock by the selling stockholders. We cannot assure you that the selling stockholders will sell any or all of the shares of our Class A common
	stock offered by them pursuant to this prospectus. In addition, we cannot assure you that the selling stockholders will not transfer, devise or gift the shares of our Class A common stock by other means not described in this prospectus.
	Moreover, shares of Class A common stock covered by this prospectus that qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this prospectus.


	From time to time, one or more of the selling stockholders may pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares
	owned by them. The pledgees, secured parties or persons to whom the shares have been hypothecated will, upon foreclosure, be deemed to be selling stockholders. The number of a selling stockholders

	Table of Contents



	shares offered under this prospectus will decrease as and when it takes such actions. The plan of distribution for that selling stockholders shares will otherwise remain unchanged. In
	addition, a selling stockholder may, from time to time, sell the shares short, and, in those instances, this prospectus may be delivered in connection with the short sales and the shares offered under this prospectus may be used to cover short
	sales.


	A selling stockholder may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers and the broker-dealers may engage in short sales of
	the shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with that selling stockholder, including, without limitation, in connection with distributions of the shares by those broker-dealers. A selling stockholder may enter into option or other
	transactions with broker-dealers that involve the delivery of the shares offered hereby to the broker-dealers, who may then resell or otherwise transfer those securities.


	A selling stockholder which is an entity may elect to make a pro rata in-kind distribution of the shares of our Class A common stock to
	its members, partners or shareholders. In such event we may file a prospectus supplement to the extent required by law in order to permit the distributees to use the prospectus to resell the Class A common stock acquired in the
	distribution. A selling stockholder which is an individual may make gifts of shares of our Class A common stock covered hereby. Such donees may use the prospectus to resell the shares or, if required by law, we may file a prospectus
	supplement naming such donees.








	LEGAL MATTERS



	On behalf of the Company, Latham & Watkins LLP will pass upon certain legal matters relating to the issuance and sale of the
	Class A common stock offered hereby. Additional legal matters may be passed upon for us, the selling stockholders or any underwriters, dealers or agents, by counsel that we will name in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	Item 15. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



	Subsection (a) of Section 145 of the DGCL empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or who is threatened
	to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or
	was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
	expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person
	reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful.


	Subsection (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
	be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person acted in any of the capacities set forth above, against expenses
	(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not
	opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent
	that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
	entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.


	Section 145 further
	provides that to the extent a director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145, or in defense of
	any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith; that indemnification provided for by Section 145
	shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the indemnified party may be entitled; and the indemnification provided for by Section 145 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has
	ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the






	Table of Contents



	benefit of such persons heirs, executors and administrators. Section 145 also empowers the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
	director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
	liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liabilities under
	Section 145.


	Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL provides that a corporations certificate of incorporation may contain a
	provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of
	a director (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
	(iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

	Restated Bylaws provide for indemnification to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL for any person who was or is made party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including involvement as a witness) in any action, suit
	or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the
	Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged
	action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer.


	The foregoing is
	only a general summary of certain aspects of the DGCL, the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Companys Third Amended and Restated Bylaws dealing with indemnification of directors and officers, and does not
	purport to be complete. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of Section 145 of the DGCL, Article VIII of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Article V of the Companys
	Third Amended and Restated Bylaws.






	Item 16. Exhibits.



	The exhibits to this registration statement are listed in the exhibit index, which appears elsewhere herein and is incorporated herein by
	reference.






	Item 17. Undertakings.



	(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:


	(i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the
	most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of
	securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with
	the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the
	effective registration statement.






	Table of Contents



	(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of
	distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;



	provided, however,

	that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included
	in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference
	in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is a part of the registration statement.


	(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a
	new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.


	(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the
	termination of the offering.


	(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	(A) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement
	as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and


	(B) Each prospectus
	required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the
	information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the
	first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date
	of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided,
	however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of
	the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement
	or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or


	(6) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the
	registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities:


	The undersigned registrant
	undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to
	such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed
	pursuant to Rule 424;


	(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the
	undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;






	Table of Contents



	(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering
	containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	(b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
	filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be
	deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.




	(e) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to deliver or cause
	to be delivered with the prospectus, to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest annual report to security holders that is incorporated by reference in the prospectus and furnished pursuant to and meeting the requirements of
	Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and, where interim financial information required to be presented by Article 3 of Regulation S-X are not set forth in the prospectus, to deliver, or cause to be delivered to each
	person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest quarterly report that is specifically incorporated by reference in the prospectus to provide such interim financial information.


	(h) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
	controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
	Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
	successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
	settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
