Our products are inspired by many growing trends. Most specifically consumers seeking new, intriguing formulations, which promote well-being either through the principles of natural therapy, or
simply for the pleasure of natural aromas, which the product will bring. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness among consumers of the benefits in using organic and natural products. Unlike many
other companies, our use of natural ingredients will not entail using a small portion of natural ingredients to tout the product as «natural.» Our products are created to support optimal benefit to
the users by containing ingredients that make a difference.

​

We intend for our products to have the following characteristics:



Moisturizing, non-irritating, softening, cleansing and nourishing



No synthetic preservatives, colors or fragrances



No Sodium Laureth (Lauryl) Sulfate to irritate skin (we use coconut oil to lather)



No Petro-chemicals, lanolin or mineral oil
 





 







 
Brief History of Our Products
Soap making history goes back many thousands years. The most basic supplies for soap making were those taken from animal and nature; many people made soap by mixing animal fats with lye. Today, soap
is produce from fats and an alkali. The cold process method is the most popular soap making process today, while some soap makers use the historical hot process.
In the early beginnings of soap making, it was an exclusive technique used by small groups of soap makers. Over time, recipes for soap making became more widely known. Back then, plant byproducts and
animal and vegetable oils were the main ingredients of soap. The price of soap was significantly reduced in 1791 when a Frenchman by the name of LeBlanc discovered a chemical process that allowed
soap to be sold for significantly less money.
More than 20 years later, another Frenchman identified relationships between glycerin, fats and acid what marked the beginning of modern soap making. Since that time, there have been no major
discoveries and the same processes are used for the soap making we use and enjoy today.
In the mid-nineteenth century, soap for bathing became a separate commodity from laundry soap, with milder soaps being packaged, sold and made available for personal use. Liquid hand soaps were
invented in the 1970s and this invention keeps soaps in the public view.

​

Types of Handcrafted Soap
While the chemical reaction that creates soap is always the same, different types of soaps can be made by different methods, all still relying upon that basic chemical reaction that
occurs.



Cold Process Soap



Hot Process Soap



Transparent Soap



«Glycerin» Soap



Ready-Made Soap Bases

Among all the brands found in this industry, we consider our closest competitors
to be Vegenero and Trifillaris is a natural line that reflects our product
concept and closely resembles our proposed product line. The concept and
creation of the Vegenero and Trifillaris product line, like ours, is an
extrapolation on the benefits of the antioxidants, polyphenols, and organic and
natural ingredients. The advantage of Vegenero and Trifillaris over our proposed
product in the marketplace at this time is twofold: (a) they have been on the
market for over a decade and have grown to be a global brand with distribution
outlets all over the world; and (b) they serve a larger target audience with a
lower price point than we anticipate.

The prime difference between Vegenero or Trifillaris and our proposed product
line is expected to be based on the market segment and Certified Organic quality
of ingredients that will be included in our products. Therefore, the containers
are key to our products' success as well. Further, our brand will use only the
highest quality USDA Certified Organic ingredients available, including
extracts, producing a highly concentrated preparation of antioxidant
polyphenols. We are also using our own uniquely innovative raw materials derived
from Certified Organic farmers in China, to process as opposed to only using
commercially available raw materials. Our product line will also be packaged in
high quality containers with inviting labels, versus the lesser quality plastic
tubes and bottles used by Hodm Professionals Limited. We believe these same
characteristics, Certified Organic, quality ingredients, and decorative
containers, will also help us stand out in the prestige market.


Company Description
On March 22, 2016, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada, USA for the purpose of handcrafted soap production. The Company has
specific business plan and is planning to order all raw materials from China to
start its operation in the nearest future. The soap itself will


 be 100% organic
and environment friendly. The Company also has a database of different kind
ingredients for soap production, which gives the company an opportunity to
expand variety offered products.
---

We produce our product in Cyprus and we have signed a contract with Hodm 
Professionals Limited, based in China, and we are ordering from them our 
equipment and raw materials for handcrafted soap production. We are also
considering other firms as well for this work. We decided to use natural
ingredients as an alternative to the synthetic ingredients prevalent in personal
care products today. We intend to establish formulations using fresh, pure, and
safe ingredients that appeal to people.

Our products are inspired by many growing trends. Most specifically consumers
seeking new, intriguing formulations, which promote well-being either through
the principles of natural therapy, or simply for the pleasure of natural aromas,
which the product will bring. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness among
consumers of the benefits in using organic and natural products. Unlike many
other companies, our use of natural ingredients will not entail using a small
portion of natural ingredients to tout the product as «natural.» Our products
are created to support optimal benefit to the users by containing ingredients
that make a difference. We plan to advertise through handcrafted soap trade
shows and marketing campaign at the stores of our future customers, distributors
and related. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers
who may want to purchase handcrafted soap from us. We will follow up with these
clients periodically, send them our new catalogues and offer them special
discounts from time to time. In future we plan to print flyers and mail them to
potential customers. We intend to use marketing methods, such as web
advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers.

We intend for our products to have the following characteristics:

. Moisturizing, non-irritating, softening, cleansing and nourishing

. No synthetic preservatives, colors or fragrances

. No Sodium Laureth (Lauryl) Sulfate to irritate skin (we use coconut oil to
  lather)

. No Petro-chemicals, lanolin or mineral oil

Among all the brands found in this industry, we consider our closest competitors
to be Vegenero and Trifillaris is a natural line that reflects our product
concept and closely resembles our proposed product line. The concept and
creation of the Vegenero and Trifillaris product line, like ours, is an
extrapolation on the benefits of the antioxidants, polyphenols, and organic and
natural ingredients. The advantage of Vegenero and Trifillaris over our proposed
product in the marketplace at this time is twofold: (a) they have been on the
market for over a decade and have grown to be a global brand with distribution
outlets all over the world; and (b) they serve a larger target audience with a
lower price point than we anticipate.

The prime difference between Vegenero or Trifillaris and our proposed product
line is expected to be based on the market segment and Certified Organic quality
of ingredients that will be included in our products. Therefore, the containers
are key to our products' success as well. Further, our brand will use only the
highest quality USDA Certified Organic ingredients available, including
extracts, producing a highly concentrated preparation of antioxidant
polyphenols. We are also using our own uniquely innovative raw materials derived
from Certified Organic farmers in China, to process as opposed to only using
commercially available raw materials. Our product line will also be packaged in
high quality containers with inviting labels, versus the lesser quality plastic
tubes and bottles used by Hodm Professionals Limited. We believe these same
characteristics, Certified Organic, quality ingredients, and decorative
containers, will also help us stand out in the prestige market.


Company Description
On March 22, 2016, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada, USA for the purpose of handcrafted soap production. The Company has
specific business plan and is planning to order all raw materials from China to
start its operation in the nearest future. The soap itself will


 be 100% organic
and environment friendly. The Company also has a database of different kind
ingredients for soap production, which gives the company an opportunity to
expand variety offered products.
---

We produce our product in Cyprus and we have signed a contract with Hodm 
Professionals Limited, based in China, and we are ordering from them our 
equipment and raw materials for handcrafted soap production. We are also
considering other firms as well for this work. We decided to use natural
ingredients as an alternative to the synthetic ingredients prevalent in personal
care products today. We intend to establish formulations using fresh, pure, and
safe ingredients that appeal to people.

Our products are inspired by many growing trends. Most specifically consumers
seeking new, intriguing formulations, which promote well-being either through
the principles of natural therapy, or simply for the pleasure of natural aromas,
which the product will bring. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness among
consumers of the benefits in using organic and natural products. Unlike many
other companies, our use of natural ingredients will not entail using a small
portion of natural ingredients to tout the product as «natural.» Our products
are created to support optimal benefit to the users by containing ingredients
that make a difference. We plan to advertise through handcrafted soap trade
shows and marketing campaign at the stores of our future customers, distributors
and related. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers
who may want to purchase handcrafted soap from us. We will follow up with these
clients periodically, send them our new catalogues and offer them special
discounts from time to time. In future we plan to print flyers and mail them to
potential customers. We intend to use marketing methods, such as web
advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers.

We intend for our products to have the following characteristics:

. Moisturizing, non-irritating, softening, cleansing and nourishing

. No synthetic preservatives, colors or fragrances

. No Sodium Laureth (Lauryl) Sulfate to irritate skin (we use coconut oil to
  lather)

. No Petro-chemicals, lanolin or mineral oil
