Can Dry Bulk Stocks Offer Insight To Time A Tanker Market Recovery? | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Can Dry Bulk Stocks Offer Insight To Time A Tanker Market Recovery?Jul. 19, 2017  8:30 AM ET|| Includes: ASC, CPLP, DHT, DSX, EGLE, EURN, FRO, GNK, GNRT, GOGL, NAP, NAT, NM, NMM, NNA, PXS, SALT, SB, SBLK, SFL, STNG, TNK, TNPby: James CatlinJames Catlin Long-term horizon, macro, commodities, maritime tradeSummaryThe stock market is often cited as a discounting mechanism, implying that it reflects both current and future events.In the case of shipping, this would imply that stock prices would begin to recover ahead of charter rates and possibly asset values.Here, we take a quick look at the dry bulk market which recently experienced a historic downturn and now appears to be recovering, albeit slowly.Note: This article was originally published July 1st on Value Investor's Edge, a Seeking Alpha subscription service. Stock prices usually fluctuate in response to changing anticipations of economic events…, not in response to the events themselves. Historically, the stock market has demonstrated an ability to presage the economy by six to 12 months. - Norman G. Fosback, from Stock Market Logic, (1987, The Institute for Econometric Research Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.). Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions. - Paul Samuelson, 1966. What Inspired This Article? Over at Value Investor's Edge, we focus heavily on maritime trade along with other deep value opportunities. This industry is highly cyclical and characterized by peak to trough movements brought on by a variety of factors. The latest downturns are all the result of market disequilibrium that can be traced to the supply side, specifically an oversupply of vessels. The first to experience this oversupply was the dry bulk market, but the tanker segment soon followed. While the dry bulk market has entered a corrective phase, tankers still have a ways to go. Nobody wants to miss the upswing, and therefore, the topic of when the market may correct and when to buy in has been heavily debated. The discounting nature of the stock market has often been cited as a reason to buy in well before the actual shipping markets have reached a bottom. But is this really the case? Here, we take a look at the latest example provided by the dry bulk market in an effort to determine if and when the stock market begins to discount for a market recovery. We will then apply the lessons learned to the crude tanker market.
 Overview Dry bulk shippers specialize in transporting cargos, typically commodities, such as iron ore, coal, grain, and other materials around the world. Companies with exposure to dry bulk include Diana Shipping, Inc. (NYSE:DSX), Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ:EGLE), Genco Shipping (NYSE:GNK), Golden Ocean Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:GOGL), Navios Maritime Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NM), Navios Maritime Partners L.P. (NYSE:NMM), Scorpio Bulkers (NYSE:SALT), Safe Bulkers, Inc. (NYSE:SB), Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK), and Ship Finance International Limited (NYSE:SFL). Companies engaged in the ownership of crude tankers, which transport oil around the world, include DHT Holdings (NYSE:DHT), Nordic American Tankers (NYSE:NAT), Euronav (NYSE:EURN), Frontline (NYSE:FRO), Gener8 Maritime Inc. (NYSE:GNRT), Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:NAP), Ship Finance International Limited, Teekay Tankers Ltd. (NYSE:TNK), Tsakos Energy Navigation Limited (NYSE:TNP), and Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:NNA). Additionally, we will briefly address the product tanker market. Companies engaged in this sector include, but are not limited to, Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG), Teekay Tankers, Tsakos Energy Navigation, Ardmore Shipping (NYSE:ASC), Navios Maritime Acquisition (NYSE:NNA), Pyxis Tankers (NASDAQ:PXS), and Capital Product Partners (NASDAQ:CPLP). Background It is widely accepted that the drybulk market is currently experiencing supply and demand disequilibrium. This was the result of too many ships ordered prior to the 2008 crash to supply a commodity demand boom that was unsustainable in the long run. The end result was a massive amount of supply that was ordered before 2008, which stretched into deliveries as late as 2014 due to the lengthy nature of the shipbuilding process and the backlog in many shipyards that spanned several years. Thus, the available supply soon outstripped post-boom demand. This oversupply problem was compounded by lackluster demand growth for the dry bulk trade which eventually led to historic lows in the coincident (i.e. current) economic indicator for the segment known as the Baltic Dry Index, or BDI. The BDI is a composite of the Baltic Capesize, Supramax, Panamax, and Handysize indices. It is useful in determining the cost to move materials by sea.
 Introduced on January 4th, 1985, at 1,000 points, this economic indicator had reached a record high 11,793 on May 20th, 2008, and a record low of 290 on February 10th, 2016. This index is not inflation-adjusted, so the level of the lows in 2016 is beyond staggering. However, since that low, the orderbook has been thinning, tonnage has been scrapped, and the market appears to have entered into a corrective phase. This situation should provide an interesting case study regarding the discounting nature of the market and just how forward-looking it really is when it comes to shipping. It also might provide a bit of insight with regard to the tanker and container shipping markets which find themselves in the midst of a pronounced downturn. Equity Value In Shipping Before we go any further, it might be useful to review (or introduce) key components of how shipping equities are valued. This will provide an understanding of not only what is being discussed but also why it is being discussed. The goal of equity valuation is to quantify just how much a company is worth. Current valuation provides a snapshot of the present. But when taking into account the discounting nature of the market, this valuation will naturally include some assumptions about the future. There are many things which can impact equity valuation, but for the purpose of this article, we will try to keep things as simple as possible. Of course, different people place different values on certain metrics when it comes to valuation but two common ones are “NAV” (Net Asset Value) and discounted cash flow, which can provide both current and future valuations. NAV looks at the value of ships which typically has a direct correlation to current charter rates and, to a lesser degree, expected charter rates in the future. Regarding cash flow, charter rates compose the operating revenue side of the equation. Given that operating costs for vessels are relatively stable, charter rates have the biggest impact in the resulting profits, or losses.
 Letting The Charts Tell The Story Now that we know what to look for and why, let's examine a few key charts that should tell the story. As noted earlier, the BDI hit a historic record low of 290 on February 10th, 2016. 

 Source: stockcharts.com A snapshot of Intermodal's Week 7, 2016, report shows just how dire the situation was. 

 Source: Intermodal Around that time, spot charter rates were well below what it cost to operate a vessel, without taking into consideration financing costs. As noted earlier, asset values tend to have a direct correlation to charter rates. 

 Source: Intermodal Notice the significant drop in prices for second-hand vessels compared to previous years and even the prior week. To better illustrate this correlation, take a look at chart presenting one-year time charter rates, coupled with asset prices. 


 Source: Golden Ocean Group Asset prices appear to closely follow the TC (time charter) trend. Another chart shows that this was the case across all classes of dry bulk vessels. 

 Source: Athenian Shipbrokers Let's take a closer look at asset values for March when they hit rock bottom. 

 Source: Allied Shipbroking Week 14, 2016, Report Notice that values, for the most part, remained unchanged through March, sitting at their five-year lows going into April. So, after seeing the historic low in the BDI in February of 2016, we saw asset prices stabilize in March and then begin an upward climb in April, following the trend in the BDI by almost two months. In Allied's Week 14, 2016, report it stated: Mixed messages coming out of the secondhand dry bulk market this past week, with buyers and sellers seemingly split into two distinct camps, as the freight market gains momentum though still lacks to reach freight levels that can be considered long-term sustainable against the average OPEX levels noted in the market. On the back of all this, rumors had started to circulate that we had begun to see deals being concluded at slightly firmer prices compared to similar tonnage concluded a few weeks prior. The truth is that there has been increased resistance noted amongst sellers these past couple of weeks, while some buyers are expressing the opinion that the market is starting to turn, something that can to some extent be reflected by the fact that there has been a considerable increase in the number of active buyers taking on vessel inspections, a fact that on its own could drive prices up once again as competition amongst them heightens. Expectations have long been that we would see a recovery in secondhand asset prices long before earnings reach any sense of "lucrative". This has mainly been in part due to the fact that given prices have reached well below anything seen during the past 25 years or more, there have been many in angst to take up buying options, feeling that there is a significant potential in asset price gains to be made once the market rebalances.
 This goes a long way in explaining why asset values lagged charter rate increases by almost two months. Now that we know when the market bottom occurred for both rates and asset values, the question is did the stock market anticipate this bottom? If so, by how much? For that, let's turn to a chart showing five companies engaging exclusively in the dry bulk trade, Diana Shipping, Genco Shipping, Golden Ocean Group, Scorpio Bulkers, and Safe Bulk Carriers. 

 Source: Google Finance For SALT, the bottom came on February 12th. GNK also saw a bottom form on February 12th but revisited those lows later that year in August. For GOGL, the bottom came on February 26th. DSX saw a bottom form on February 12th as well but revisited that bottom several times throughout 2016 in March, May, June, and August. SB was the only stock that seemed to catch an early bottom on January 15th (note: SB and DSX were major short ideas from Value Investor’s Edge, first shared and initiated in early November 2015). Three out of the five stocks put in bottoms two days after the BDI hit bottom. One, approximately one month before, and one, approximately two weeks after. One thing to consider is the charter structure of these companies. Diana operates on short-term time charters with most lasting anywhere from about 10 to 16 months. The other companies had a significant degree of spot exposure, meaning they more closely tracked the market while Diana's charter contracts stayed with them for a while. This is important because several tanker companies have high degrees of spot exposure. Dry Bulk Conclusions The popular disclaimer of "past performance is not a guarantee of future results" should be mentioned here. But nevertheless, this case study provides some interesting insights.
 The foremost being that the market didn't predict a recovery well ahead of time and rates provided the catalyst for a turn in stock prices. Stock prices responded to the rate bottom in a matter of days while asset values lagged behind by a couple months. Furthermore, DSX, which was on time charters, didn't respond to the recovery in the same manner as those with heavy spot exposure. In fact, if we go from February 12th, 2016, DSX is up only 63% and, as noted earlier, revisited the bottom several times. But GOGL is up 84%, GNK is up 91%, SALT is up 216%, and SB is up 325%. This indicates that during large market upswings (or downturns) companies with higher degrees of spot exposure will respond to these moves in a more profound manner. Of course, I am being a bit simplistic here. We could cite Diana's higher OPEX or older fleet as part of the reason for the lag. Additionally, as noted earlier, these other companies are more heavily geared toward the spot market, meaning the degree of capitulation was greater during the downturn and therefore left more room to the upside during a recovery phase. Nevertheless, the point remains that market movements impact those tied to the spot market to a greater degree than those utilizing even short-term charter strategies. Applying This To Tankers Now, the most important question: when will the crude tanker market recover? The dry bulk market found its low at a well-known seasonal slowdown. Furthermore, it came as the supply side began to enter a corrective phase following an unprecedented level of capitulation. Those two factors should play into the tanker market recovery. Now, if you are an avid reader of my work, you probably already know the point I'm trying to make. But allow me to take a couple quotes from recent articles which should provide a good overview of an approximate timeline. In my February Crude Tanker Market Macro Outlook, I concluded: Since late 2015 I have been forecasting a tumultuous 2017 for crude tankers based on an orderbook that appeared to be too large for too little growth. This situation is now firmly upon the market and rates should suffer as a result. While there will be some upswings here and there based on seasonal demand or the ebb and flow of global trade, 2017 looks to be the worst year as a whole for crude tankers in a few years with a hangover likely carrying over into 2018.
 Another recent article examining the seasonality of crude tankers and the impact on rates entitled The Recent Crude Tanker Rate Collapse concluded: Seasonal demand plays a key role in crude tanker rates. For VLCC's the refinery maintenance season in Asia means less crude is sourced, vessel availability increases, and rates fall. But as these refineries come back online to supply increasing summer demand, more crude will need to be sourced and VLCC demand could normalize and perhaps provide a brief uptick in spot rates. That seasonality can be summed up in the following charts. 

 Source: OFE Insights 

 Source: MJLF Additionally, the first signs of real capitulation have started to form over the past couple months with rates well below OPEX levels. 

Source: Weber Weekly Tanker Report However, these sub-OPEX levels were sustained for quite some time in the drybulk space before a turnaround really surfaced. Knowing all this gives us the timeline for the first potential recovery point. As stated earlier, the hangover is expected to carry over well into 2018. Furthermore, refinery maintenance will provide a seasonal slowdown in the spring. The conclusion of refinery maintenance in the spring of 2018 therefore provides the first somewhat promising macro backdrop for the beginning of a corrective phase.
 While that may be the first potential turnaround point, it is probably quite a bit early. A more likely date may come as the summer concludes. Notice that in the charts above, all three vessel classes put in year lows between August and September. This is not unusual. Let's take a quick look at August and September which is where the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index often puts in the seasonal lows. 

Source: Lloyd's List Intelligence In 2013 and 2014, September marked a turning point. In 2015 and 2016, the lows came in August. This pattern is well established and is due to the end of the summer refining season/driving season and the lull that comes before the northern countries prepare for winter by importing more oil for heating. While spring marks the first potential turning point, the end of summer/beginning of autumn presents what looks to be a turning point with the greatest potential in 2018, especially since the supply side has had a greater amount of time to rebalance. Now, please notice the word potential. This is because there are still a couple factors that need to come in line for this to play out. First, there are still several vessels set to hit the water through 2018. Therefore, the demolition of older vessels becomes a significant factor in balancing the supply/demand equation. Unfortunately, the delay in implementing the BWMC (Ballast Water Management Convention), moving from September 2017 to September 2019, looks to be a negative for the supply side. In fact, several shipbrokers have revised their outlook for 2017 and 2018 scrapping as a result. Weber had this to say: 

Source: Weber Weekly Tanker Report Issue 28
 Furthermore, there is still a significant amount of crude in storage. Some of that needs to be digested by the market, so trade flows can return to normal. Finally, and very important for long-term investors, I would point out here that there has been an increasing amount of orders placed for tankers. My upcoming Crude Tanker Supply Side Update (July 2017) will be out shortly detailing this trend. If this ordering spree continues, it could be the making of another oversupply of vessels hitting the water, so the orderbook must be watched closely in order to determine if the above timeline is the beginning of a sustainable recovery or just another seasonal shift. If the orderbook continues to thicken and the above corrective factors don't play out in favor of a recovery, we could be looking at a prolonged downturn as recent orders for new tonnage contribute to an oversupply problem that hasn't quite entered a corrective phase. In Short Up until about three months ago, that Summer/Autumn 2018 recovery timeline would have been a pretty safe bet. However, the thickening orderbook and the delay of the BWMC have recently forced me to rethink that recovery timeline. It wouldn't surprise me to see the supply side imbalance continue throughout 2018 and into 2019 before vessels are scrapped, and we see orders hitting the water slow down enough, allowing the demand side to catch up. Especially since we seem to be working through the high crude inventory levels at a much slower pace than previously anticipated from the OPEC cuts. The only X-factor at this point is just how deep the market will fall and for how long. Remember, in a troubled market, the degree of capitulation has a direct impact on scrapping rates. Additionally, the perception of just how long the market will stay bad also influences the decision to scrap. So, perhaps the significant drop in rates lately, coupled with a thickening orderbook, could be viewed as a good thing for the long run as it may inspire increased scrapping rates, thus hastening a return to market equilibrium.
 Product Tankers One final observation based on this pattern is that the clean index seems to lag the dirty by approximately a month. The clean tanker market is also facing some headwinds but is projected to clear up a little sooner than the dirty market. The seasonal fluctuations for this segment lead us to consider to potential dates going forward. Though the product tanker segment (specifically the US Gulf Atlantic basin) has been seeing some strength lately due to the summer season and an ongoing outage at the 330,000-b/d Pemex Salina Cruz refinery in Mexico, which should be resolved in July, overall trade flows have yet to normalize due to abnormally high product stocks in key countries and a slight oversupply of vessels. For this reason, it looks as though the two potential turnaround points to consider would be the September/October range toward the end of 2017, followed by the conclusion of refinery maintenance season toward the end of the spring in 2018. Both appear to be good candidates, and the deciding factors may be scrapping rates and how quickly the market is able to digest stockpiles. It is also noteworthy that the MR segment presents the best prospects when that recovery begins due to the vessel supply outlook and a trade flow dynamics. But more on that in my upcoming Product Tanker Supply Side Update (July 2017), which is already out on Value Investor's Edge. Thank you for reading, and I welcome all questions/comments.

President Trump's latest explanation of Trumpcare is nonsense




				 21 Juillet, 2017,  04:03 | Author: Claudine Rigal			















 


 
 
 
Trump: Nothing changes. Nothing changes.
In an in an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, President Donald Trump offered a freakish example of the USA healthcare system while discussing Republican reform efforts. "As they get something, it gets tougher". Four years later, Mitt Romney casually tried to bet Rick Perry $10,000 he didn't favor individual health care mandates, drawing criticism that he was out of touch with the financial burdens of many Americans.During a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump and reporter Maggie Haberman talked about health care policy as the GOP-led effort to pass health care reform legislation tanked."So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal". In it, the president states: "Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you're 21 years old, you start working and you're paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you're 70, you get a nice plan".Earlier Wednesday, Trump also said that under the Senate's (currently non-existent) health care plan, people would have better protections for pre-existing conditions than they did under the Affordable Care Act. It's a very tough deal, but it is something that we're doing a good job of.

Sue Bird comes out as gay, in relationship with Megan Rapinoe
					Bird is ultra-cautious and appears to have it together at all times, something she's worked for her entire life.  She added that Rapinoe's activism wasn't a driving factor in her decision to come out, however.
					
Now Trump thinks health insurance costs $12 a year
					This isn't the first time Trump has so dramatically underestimated the costs of health insurance. The president seems to be saying it costs $12 a year to insure a 21-year-old-or $1 per month.
					
Macron busca limar rigideces tras renuncia del jefe Estado Mayor
					De 55 años, asumirá sus funciones este jueves, según informó el portavoz del gobierno Christophe Castaner . Además, confirmó que en 2025 Francia destinará el 2% de su Producto Interno Bruto a gasto militar.
					Although it is possible some people pay $12 per year or less for insurance, that is likely only a result of a generous employer contribution that lowers the cost for employees as part of their benefits package.Daniel Dale, the Washington, D.C., correspondent for the Toronto Star, wrote on Twitter that Trump could be confusing health insurance with life insurance, ads for which are a staple of cable-TV news late at night.In other words, Trump is suggesting that most Americans have access to health insurance that costs about the same as Netflix.The actual average premium for a single person is $538 a month, with employees paying about 18 percent and the employer picking up the rest, according to the Kaiser Foundation.

Astros interested in Tigers pitchers Justin Verlander, Justin WilsonMarie-Louise Castex




The Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers and Boston Red Sox are among the clubs most interested in Wilson, MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported. The question is, will doing that be enough to get a team to bite on the aging veteran. Anthony Fenech of the Detroit Free Press tweets that he's been told the Astros' involvement in talks regarding Verlander "has been minimal". The Chicago Cubs are also still interested despite the fact that they have already acquired Jose Quintana from the Chicago White Sox. USA Today's Bob Nightengale predicts Avila will be the next Tiger to be traded, noting that "no team has expressed stronger interest" than Chicago.


BidaskClub Downgrades Diana Shipping inc. (NYSE:DSX) to Hold
					On average, equities analysts forecast that Diana Shipping inc. will post ($0.99) earnings per share for the current year. Geode Capital Management LLC purchased a new stake in Diana Shipping inc. during the first quarter worth about $167,000.
				With that said, Verlander's production has dipped recently (4.54 ERA), and he still has three years and $78 million left on his contract after this season. That would obviously be a much tougher deal to negotiate given Verlander's 10/5 rights giving him veto power over any trade, not to mention the massive amount of money he's still owed on his contract. In his six-year career, Wilson has a 3.21 ERA and a 1.194 WHIP. He's played in two World Series (2006, 2012), but has yet to win a ring.

About Us




Diana Shipping Inc. (NYSE: DSX) is a global provider of shipping transportation services. We specialize in the ownership of dry bulk vessels. As of July 13, 2017 our fleet consists of 51 dry bulk vessels (4 Newcastlemax, 14 Capesize, 5 Post-Panamax, 5 Kamsarmax and 23 Panamax). As of the same date, the combined carrying capacity of our fleet is approximately 5.9 million dwt with a weighted average age of 7.95 years.
Our fleet is managed by our wholly-owned subsidiary Diana Shipping Services S.A. and our established 50/50 joint venture with Wilhelmsen Ship Management named Diana Wilhelmsen Management Limited in Cyprus.
Diana Shipping Inc. also owns approximately 16.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Diana Containerships Inc. (NASDAQ: DCIX), a global provider of shipping transportation services through its ownership of containerships, that currently owns and operates eleven container vessels (6 Post-Panamax and 5 Panamax).


Among the distinguishing strengths that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the dry bulk shipping industry are the following:

We own a modern, high quality fleet of dry bulk carriers.
Our fleet includes groups of sister ships, providing operational and scheduling flexibility, as well as cost efficiencies.
We have an experienced management team.
We benefit from the experience and reputation of Diana Shipping Services S.A. and the relationship with Wilhelmsen Ship Management through the Diana Wilhelmsen Management Limited joint venture.
We benefit from strong relationships with members of the shipping and financial industries.
We have a strong balance sheet and a low level of indebtedness.

Our main objective is to manage and expand our fleet in a manner that will enable us to enhance shareholder value. To accomplish this objective, we intend to pursue highly focused business strategies, including: maintaining a high quality fleet; strategically expanding the size of our fleet; pursuing an appropriate balance of short-term and long-term time charters; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and maintaining low cost, highly efficient operations. In addition, we intend to capitalize on our reputation for high standards of performance, reliability and safety to establish and maintain relationships with major international charterers and financial institutions.

                        Audit Committee Charter

                    

This Audit Committee Charter (“Charter”) has been adopted by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Diana Shipping Inc. (the “Company”). 

Statement of Purpose

The Audit Committee of the Board of the Company (the “Committee”) shall assist the Board in its oversight of (i) the quality and integrity of the Company’s financial statements and its accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices, (ii) the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) the independent auditor’s qualifications and independence and (iv) the performance of the Company’s independent auditors and the Company’s internal audit function.  It may also have such other duties as may from time to time be assigned to it by the Board and are required by the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) or any other securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are traded.  In carrying out its responsibilities, the Board believes that the policies and procedures set forth in this Charter should remain flexible and be interpreted to allow the Committee to best adapt and react to changing business and regulatory requirements.

The Committee shall maintain free and open communication with the independent auditors, internal auditors, and Company management.  In discharging its oversight role, the Committee shall have full access to all Company books, records, facilities, personnel and outside professionals.  The Committee shall have the authority and shall receive necessary funding from the Company to retain special legal, accounting or other consultants or advisors employed by the Committee and shall obtain such advice and assistance from such special legal, accounting or other consultants or advisors as the Committee deems necessary.  The Committee shall have sole authority to approve related fees and retention terms.  Each member of the Committee shall be entitled to rely on (i) the integrity of those persons and organizations within and outside the Company from which it receives information, (ii) the accuracy of the financial and other information provided by such persons or organizations absent actual knowledge to the contrary (which shall be promptly reported to the Board) and (iii) representations made by management as to all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to the Company.

Composition; Independence

The membership of the Committee shall consist of at least two directors that are appointed to the Committee by the Board, each of whom the Board has determined is free of any material relationship with the Company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization with a relationship to the company, and who satisfy the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the NYSE or any other securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are traded.  The Board shall appoint a member as a chairman of the Committee, who shall be responsible for leadership of the Committee, including scheduling and presiding over meetings, preparing agendas, making regular reports to the Board, and maintaining regular liaison with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, lead independent audit partner and director of internal audit.  In the absence of the appointed chairman from any meeting of the Committee, the Committee may select another member to act as chairman for such meeting.  Additionally, each director appointed to the Committee shall serve on the Audit Committees of no more than two public companies other than the Company, unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of the member to effectively serve the Committee.  The Board shall at least once every two years review the Committee’s and its members’ compliance with such requirements, and the Board may remove any director from the Committee at any time for any reason with or without cause.

Meetings; Quorum

The Committee shall meet as often as it deems necessary in order to perform its responsibilities, but not less than three times annually.  The Committee may act by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting.  The Committee shall also periodically meet with the Company’s management, internal auditors and independent auditors separately from the Board.  The presence of a majority, but no fewer than two, of the then-appointed members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum.  In every case where a quorum is present, action of the Committee may be taken by the Committee upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present.

Responsibilities

The Committee’s job is one of oversight.  Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company’s financial statements.  Management and the internal auditing department are responsible for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and practices and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.  The independent auditors are responsible for auditing the annual financial statements.
The Committee and the Board recognize that management and the independent auditors have more resources and time and more detailed knowledge and information regarding the Company’s accounting, financial and auditing practices than do Committee members; accordingly, the Committee’s oversight role does not provide any expert or special assurance as to the Company’s financial statements or any certification as to the work of the independent auditors.  Nor is it the duty of the Committee to conduct investigations, to resolve disagreements, if any, between management and the independent auditors, or to assure compliance with laws and regulations.
Although the Board and the Committee may wish to consider other duties from time to time, the general recurring activities of the Committee in carrying out its oversight role are described below.  The Committee shall be responsible for:
 
Oversight of Independent Auditor and the Audit Process

The appointment, replacement, compensation, evaluation and oversight of the work of the independent auditors to be retained to audit the annual financial statements of the Company and review the quarterly financial statements of the Company.
Annually obtaining and reviewing the independent auditors’ formal written statement describing: the firm’s internal quality-control procedures; any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to deal with any such issues.
Annually obtaining from the independent auditors a formal written statement describing all relationships between the independent auditors and the Company, and actively engaging in a dialogue with the independent auditors with respect to any disclosed relationships that may impact the objectivity and independence of the auditors, and shall consider whether the independent auditors’ provision of non-audit services to the Company, if any, is compatible with the auditors’ independence.  The Committee shall recommend that the Board take appropriate actions to satisfy itself as to the independent auditors’ independence.
Monitoring the regular rotation of the audit partners of the independent auditors as required by applicable law.
Overseeing the relationship with the independent auditors, including discussing with the auditors the planning and staffing of the audit and the nature and rigor of the audit process, receiving and reviewing audit reports, reviewing with the auditors any problems or difficulties the auditors may have encountered in carrying out their responsibilities and any management letters provided by the auditors and the Company’s response to such letters, and providing the auditors full access to the Committee and the Board to report on all appropriate matters.
Pre-approving or approving all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditor to the Company and obtaining from the independent auditors at least annually a formal written statement of the fees billed for all audit services (including any comfort letters) and all permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors for the most recent fiscal year.  The Chairman of the Committee must provide prior approval of all non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor, subject to the de-minimus exception set forth in Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Reviewing the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements, as applicable, and discussing them with management and the independent auditors.  These discussions shall include the matters required to be discussed under the Statement of Auditing Standards adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, consideration of the quality of the Company’s accounting principles as applied in its financial reporting, and the Company’s disclosures under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  Such discussions may include a review of particularly sensitive accounting estimates, reserves and accruals, review of judgmental areas, review of critical accounting policies and alternative treatments of financial information, review of audit adjustments, review of risk exposures that may have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and the policies and steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and other such inquiries as the Committee or the independent auditors shall deem appropriate.  Based on its review, and its confirmation that management believes the financial statements to be included in the Company’s annual report contain no material misstatements, the Committee shall make its recommendation to the Board as to the inclusion of the Company’s audited financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F (or the Annual Report to Shareholders, if distributed prior to the filing of the Form 20-F).
Keeping the independent auditors informed of the Committee's understanding of the Company's relationships and transactions with related parties that are significant to the company; and reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors the auditors' evaluation of the Company's identification of, accounting for, and disclosure of its relationships and transactions with related parties, including any significant matters arising from the audit regarding the Company's relationships and transactions with related parties.
To review and discuss with the Company's independent auditors any other matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standards No, 16, Communications with Audit Committees, including, without limitation, the auditors' evaluation of the quality of the company's financial reporting, information relating to significant unusual transactions and the business rationale for such transactions and the auditors' evaluation of the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

 
Oversight of Internal Audit 
 

Preparing annually a report of the Committee and the submission of such report to the full Board for approval and, to the extent required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission then applicable to the Company, to cause such report to be included in the Company’s annual proxy statement.
Discussing with management the financial statements proposed to be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F and obtaining assurances from management that such financial statements contain no material misstatements or omissions and obtaining from the independent auditors confirmation that, in the course of their audit, they learned of no material misstatements.
Providing oversight of the Company’s auditing, accounting and financial reporting principles, policies, controls, procedures and practices, and reviewing significant changes to the foregoing as suggested by the independent auditors, internal auditors or management.
Discussing with management and/or the Company’s general or outside legal counsel any legal matters (including the status of pending litigation) that may have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements, and any material reports or inquiries from regulatory or governmental agencies.
Receiving from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company a report of all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls, and any fraud that involves management or other employees who have a material role in the Company’s internal controls and procedures.
Discussing with management and the independent auditors the quality and adequacy of the Company’s internal audit controls and procedures and the internal audit function’s organization, responsibilities, plans, results, budget and staffing, as well as providing oversight to any internal audit activities, including review of significant reports prepared by the internal auditors, and management’s response.

Other Responsibilities 
 

Discussing with management and independent auditors earnings press releases, as well as financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies.
Establishing clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the external auditors.
Discussing with management policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
Establishing and reviewing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints from the Company’s employees on accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, as well as for confidential, anonymous submissions by the Company’s employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
Unless otherwise determined by the Board, reviewing all material related-party transactions, including transactions between the Company and its officers or directors or affiliates or members of the immediate families of such directors or officers.
Regularly reporting the Committee’s activities to the Board and making such recommendations with respect to the above and to any other matters as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate.
Engaging in an annual self-assessment of the Committee with the goal of continuing improvement. The Committee shall review this Charter every two years and recommend any proposed changes to the Board for approval.

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy).

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 6 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.11)Consensus Price Target: $4.38 (11.32% upside)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

                Coverage Initiation: Diana Shipping Inc.


                    Robert Harrington
                
 | February 25, 2014
                
                






 Value Line recently initiated coverage of Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX) in its flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey. This Greek shipping company owns and operates dry bulk vessels for international shipping. Diana specializes in the transportation of commodities, such as iron ore, coal, and grain, among others. In addition to its eponymous shipping business, the company also owns a 9.5% stake in Diana Containerships (DCIX).
Founded in 1999, the company owns 37 shipping vessels, among the fleet is the recently introduced “Crystalia”, an Ice Class Panamax ship. The “Panamax” name derives from its intended passageway, the Panama Canal, and make up over half of Diana’s fleet with a total of 19 ships.  The remainder of the company’s fleet is made up of a variety of ships classified by size and shipping route. For instance, the three Post-Panamax shipping containers are among the largest in the world, and too vast to transport through Panama. Rounding out the company’s arsenal are ten Capesize, three Kamarsax, and two Newcastlemax vessels.
Diana is in the midst of an expansion. Over the past few years, the company has invested in growing its fleet. This strategy lends itself to a more focused long-term plan. That is, by investing the money in an updated fleet in the short term, Diana saves itself millions in operating costs related to aging ships further down the road. In addition to the aforementioned “Crystalia”, the business expects to add another Ice Class Panamax vessel by the end of the first quarter. After that, two Newcastlemax vessels and one Kamarsax are expected to be delivered within the next year, helping the company realize its goal of a 14% fleet expansion. In the mean time, though, the production and other costs affiliated with these ships will likely hurt the bottom line.
The operating environment for shipping companies has been a challenging one recently. International charter rates were down over the past year, putting pressure on the entire industry. As Diana derives the bulk of its revenues from charter arrangements, the downward trend was especially adverse. In fact, despite increasing its fleet, total business decreased by about 25% in 2013. And while the new ships probably weighed on profitability last year, the aforementioned macroeconomic concerns were likely the main drivers for the $75 million-plus year-over-year swing into the red.
Luckily for potential investors in Diana, the external forces that determine the nature of the shipping industry are largely uncontrollable, and affect all companies equally. Thus, the operationally efficient Diana should have a leg up on most of its competitors if the market turns around. That the “Crystalia” has already been committed to an 18-month lease merely weeks into its life underscores the Greek company’s ability to glean new business even in lean times. Still, we caution that shipping rates are highly volatile, in which case Diana and its expanded fleet could struggle into the future.
Subscribers interested in owning a piece of this small-cap shipping provider are advised to consult Value Line’s quarterly reports for Diana Shipping Inc., as well as any supplemental reports and relevant articles as important news items arise.
At the time of this article’s writing, the author held no positions in any of the companies mentioned.
