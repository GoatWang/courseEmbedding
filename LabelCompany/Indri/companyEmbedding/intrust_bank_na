Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

				What is a Routing Number?
Routing number is a Nine digit code assigned by American Bankers Association (ABA). It uniquely identifies the financial institution and check-processing center. Routing number is also referred as Bank Routing number, routing transit number (RTN), ABA routing number and swift codes. Routing number is most commonly used for ACH (Automated Clearing House), check deposit and bank wire transfers. It is used to send and receive funds from other financial institutions. It varies based on the region where your account was opened.
How can I find my Bank Routing number?
Routing number is printed on the lower left corner of your Bank Check Book. At the bottom of the Check you will find 3 groups of numbers. The first group is Routing number, the second group is your bank account number and the final group is your check number.

If you don't have your Check Book, you can simply use our Routing Number Lookup facility to find your Bank’s Routing Code.
What information is required to receive a Wire Transfer?
For Domestic Wire Transfer one needs to provide following information:

Beneficiary Name
Beneficiary  Account number
ABA/Routing Number
Beneficiary Bank Name and Address

For international bank transfers one needs to provide Swift code along with routing number.
Some routing numbers are restricted to use. Please check with your financial institution directly to confirm the routing number.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned
