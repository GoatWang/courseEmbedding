ST. PAUL, MN -- H.B. Fuller Co. has announced that Thomas W. Handley was elected as an independent member to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Handley's position expands the board to eight directors, seven of whom are independent. Handley is currently President of Ecolab's global food and beverage division. "Tom brings exceptional leadership and operations experience to H.B. Fuller, and we are excited to have him serve as a board member," said Michele Volpi, H.B. Fuller President and Chief Executive Officer. "Tom's background with growing product lines both at Ecolab and Procter & Gamble, particularly overseas, will be a tremendous support to our recent investments in the Asia-Pacific and EIMEA markets. With much of his career leading businesses abroad, Tom is well versed in the global company mindset. H.B. Fuller is committed to being a global company and a collaborative partner for our customers, and Tom will help position us to do so." Handley heads Ecolab's $1.4 billion global food and beverage division, which sells to many of the largest companies in the world. Handley has more than 25 years of profit and loss (P&L) leadership experience in global business environments, including businesses in Asia and Latin America. Handley joined Ecolab in 2003, and he has since progressed through numerous roles and demonstrated improved results in several troubled business situations while also leading major new strategic thrusts. Previously, Handley served as Vice President and General Manager for Procter & Gamble's paper products business in Japan and Korea. During his tenure, Pampers diapers' market share doubled in Japan. Also at Procter & Gamble, he led global marketing and strategic planning for the company's multi-billion dollar feminine care business.

H.B. Fuller Adds Thomas W. Handley to Board of Directors



Published on 2010-07-09. Author :
SpecialChem









  
ST. PAUL, Minn. --
H.B. Fuller Company announced that Thomas W. Handley was elected as an independent member to its board of directors, effective immediately. Handley's position expands the board to eight directors, seven of whom are independent.
Handley is currently president of Ecolab's global food and beverage division. "Tom brings exceptional leadership and operations experience to H.B. Fuller, and we are excited to have him serve as a board member," said Michele Volpi, H.B. Fuller president and chief executive officer. "Tom's background with growing product lines both at Ecolab and Procter & Gamble, particularly overseas, will be a tremendous support to our recent investments in the Asia Pacific and EIMEA markets. With much of his career leading businesses abroad, Tom is well-versed in the global company mindset. H.B. Fuller is committed to being a global company, and a collaborative partner for our customers, and Tom will help position us to do so." 
Handley heads Ecolab's $1.4 billion global food and beverage division, which sells to many of the largest, most sophisticated companies in the world. Handley has more than 25 years of profit and loss (P&L) leadership experience in global business environments, including businesses in Asia and Latin America. Handley joined Ecolab in 2003, and he has since progressed through numerous roles and demonstrated improved results in several troubled business situations while also leading major new strategic thrusts. Previously, Handley served as vice president and general manager for Procter & Gamble's paper products business in Japan and Korea. During his tenure, Pampers diapers' market share doubled in Japan. Also at Procter & Gamble, he led global marketing and strategic planning for the company's multi-billion dollar feminine care business.
 "H.B. Fuller has made considerable strides in achieving international and organic growth, positioning the company for a strong future," said Handley. "I'm delighted to leverage my experience to help H.B. Fuller gain increased market share and profitability." 
Handley is a board member at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts and Twin Cities Red Cross. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Claremont-McKenna College and his MBA from the University of Chicago. 
About H.B. Fuller Company:  
H.B. Fuller Company is a leading worldwide manufacturer and marketer of adhesives, sealants, paints and other specialty chemical products, with fiscal 2009 net revenue of $1.235 billion. Its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FUL.

Thomas W. Fuller



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Massachusetts:













Does Thomas W. Fuller carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that involves a building's structural elements in addition to other construction, must be performed by a licensed construction supervisor, issued by the Department of Public Safety. A home improvement contractor must be registered by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, to perform any nonstructural residential home improvement work.
Thomas W. Fuller currently holds license 11675, 22745 (Master Plumber), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Massachusetts?



Contractors in Massachusetts must prove continous work experience in their trade or a construction related degree from an accredited college, before they can take an exam to become a licensed contractor. Construction supervisor licenses must be renewed every 2 years, after taking the requisite continuing education requirements. 











Your liability risk when hiring Thomas W. Fuller



Contractors in Massachusetts must carry general liability insurance and an active workers' compensation policy. Proof of a current workers compensation policy is required to file a building permit as a contractor in Massachusetts. Be sure to request a copy of certificates for each policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Thomas W. Fuller



If a remodeling project has gone badly a homeowner can recoup up to $10,000 of actual losses through the Home Improvement Contractor Guaranty Fund. The property must be the owner's primary residence, and a claim must be filed within 6 months of the initial court judgement or the arbitration award date.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Massachusetts, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.
