After working as a reporter for The Miami Herald, since 1987, Carney joined Time magazine as the Miami bureau chief, in 1989.

On December 15, 2008, Carney left the private sector to take a position as director of communications to Vice President-elect Joe Biden.[4][5]
On 27 January 2011, Carney was selected to become the Obama Administration's second White House press secretary.[1] He was named the successor to previous White House press secretary Robert Gibbs by White House chief of staff, William M. Daley.[6][7] Carney was one of fourteen White House appointees announced by Daley on that day.[7]
On 30 May 2014, President Barack Obama announced Carney would be succeeded by Josh Earnest.[8]

Following his stint as press secretary, he worked as a CNN senior political analyst, from September 2014 to February 2015.[9][10]

On 2 March 2015, Carney began working for Amazon.com, Inc. as the senior vice president of worldwide corporate affairs.[11]
Awards[edit]
He has written and reported about the Presidency of George W. Bush, and was one of a few reporters who were aboard Air Force One with Bush on September 11, 2001.[3] In 2003, he won the 2003 Gerald R. Ford prize for distinguished reporting on the presidency of the United States of America.
Personal life[edit]
Carney lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Claire Shipman, a senior correspondent for ABC News, and their two children.[12] He is a devoted fan of the indie rock band Guided By Voices.[13]
