(Nasdaq:    AMBC) ("Ambac" or the "Company"), released its presentation to Independent Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) on Wednesday, April 13, 2016. 
The full presentation has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and can be accessed at www.sec.gov.


Canyon Capital continues to believe that there is a need for improved oversight on the Board of Directors of Ambac ("Ambac's Board"), and therefore filed a preliminary proxy statement on April 8, 2016 to nominate Frederick Arnold to Ambac's Board in replacement of current board member and Chairman, Jeffrey Stein, at Ambac's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 18, 2016. 
Mr. Arnold has over 30 years of experience working in financial services, including currently serving as a member of the post-emergence Board of Directors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which has been intimately involved in liquidating and resolving hundreds of billions of dollars of assets and claims.  Mr. Arnold has a track record of successfully working with boards to return capital to stockholders and maximize enterprise value. Canyon Capital believes Mr. Arnold will bring a more open-minded approach to the assessment of CEO Nader Tavakoli's policies and tenure than Mr. Stein.  
In an apparent effort to undercut Canyon Capital and discredit its concerns, Ambac's press release issued on April 11, 2016 falsely accused Canyon Capital of engaging in attempted 'greenmail', citing an approach by a broker offering to sell to Ambac a package of Ambac-insured Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities.  There is no basis whatsoever for that irresponsible accusation.  
Contrary to the Company's claim, Canyon Capital never directed or authorized anyone to approach Ambac with a proposal to sell its Ambac-insured securities at a premium, or at any price for that matter.  As Ambac's own press release notes, Canyon Capital's CUSIPs are public as a consequence of its disclosures in its public filing with respect to the Company, and therefore any broker could reference them.  Instead of retracting its accusation, Ambac now claims that it received "a detailed communication from a broker that included very specific details regarding the securities being offered and an offer price for each individual security as well as the seller's preference for the structure of the transaction – clearly indicating their active role in the process."  Ambac's determination that Canyon Capital was involved based on public details and a structure purportedly provided by a broker is absurd.  Given the public availability of the securities' CUSIPs, a broker could have proposed anything with respect to them. 
Not only did Canyon Capital make no such offer, but in fact it was called by a brokerage house indicating that Ambac was interested in buying back all of Canyon Capital's positions in those securities. The sales person was accompanied on the call by a research analyst who publishes on Ambac and has direct contacts with its senior management. If the brokerage house was in fact acting for Ambac, the Company's 'greenmail' claim would be not only baseless, but a new low in duplicity and manipulation for this management that should prompt immediate investigation by an independent committee of Ambac's Board.
Ambac stockholders deserve a board that will be honest about its operations, its earnings and its value creation efforts.  If Mr. Arnold is elected as a director to Ambac's Board, the resulting Ambac Board will be more balanced, with three new directors that have been approved by stockholders (of which two were stockholder proposed). 
Canyon Capital is confident in Mr. Arnold's ability to work with Ambac's management and Ambac's Board on a plan to deploy capital for liability management, such as commutations and buybacks; pursue operational improvements; enhance the value of existing balance sheet assets; and maximize capital return to stockholders.
Additional proxy related materials are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or by request to Canyon Capital's proxy solicitor, Okapi Partners, at its toll-free number (877) 796-5274 or via email at info@okapipartners.com.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
