Services
Lennox experts solve problems and preserve your business climate.





Full Protection HVAC Offering
This program locks in your HVAC service expenses at an agreed-upon rate, eliminating any potential cost escalations and substantially reducing paperwork.
                                                And since it covers repair and replacement of everything inside an HVAC unit, it also helps keep equipment performing optimally and lowers operational costs.









Preventive Maintenance
Performed up to four times per year, our 33-point maintenance check covers all major system components and provides a comprehensive rating for your equipment. This allows you to make repairs before major expenses occur, extending the life of your equipment and helping control costs.









Equipment Operation Check and Guided Setup
After each unit has been installed, we’ll perform a comprehensive 64-point check to ensure it’s working properly and take it through the basic and advanced guided setup processes. Any defective components will be repaired and a report for each unit will be provided to the installing contractor, general contractor and owner.









Commissioning
Lennox’ carefully designed commissioning process helps ensure your system is running efficiently and reliably from the start. Our technicians will verify and document key functions, including:

Correct equipment and options are installed and meet construction details
Lennox startup procedures are performed and sequences of operations are correct
Devices, including remote sensors, are correctly calibrated
System alarms are active, operation is correct and equipment safeties are functioning properly










Planned Replacement Program
At some point, it becomes more cost-effective to stop repairing older equipment and instead invest in new equipment that delivers higher efficiencies along with potential rebates and tax credits. Our team can help you proactively replace old and ageing equipment on your terms rather than waiting for an emergency situation.









Equipment Recycling
After installing your new unit, we’ll also haul away the old equipment safely and securely, decommission and recycle the used materials and provide the landfill avoidance reporting to meet your sustainability goals. Considering Lennox National Account customers replace, on average, 215 rooftop units per year, you could save up to 74.7 metric tons of CO2 annually just by using our recycling program.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
