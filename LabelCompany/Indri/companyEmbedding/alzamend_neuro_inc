World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Features









A 3D Look Inside the Brain
Stanford Health Care is using a new software system that combines imaging from MRIs, CTs and angiograms to create a three-dimensional model that physicians and patients can see and manipulate—just like a virtual reality (VR) game.




Doctor Stories
Jeffrey Dunn, MD: Why I Went into Medicine
Jeffrey Dunn once thought science was just memorizing facts. Then, an inspiring teacher offered another viewpoint: Find answers to science’s open questions.










Clinical Trials

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are research studies that test or improve ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases. Trials may be designed to study new drugs, surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use or combine existing options. A clinical trial may give you access to innovative therapies or technologies before they are available anywhere else.



Patients at the Stanford Neuroscience Health Center have access to more than 50 clinical trials, many of them available only at Stanford or very few hospitals in the country. If you would like assistance searching for trials, call 650-498-7425.

USF/BYRD Institute Anouncement
 
USF Researcher Develops Therapeutic Vaccine to Combat Alzheimer’s Disease and Neurodegenerative Disorders
January 19, 2017


Alzamend Neuro™ has licensed the USF treatment to help advance commercialization
TAMPA, Fla. – A neuroscientist at the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute and the USF College of Pharmacy has developed an immunotherapeutic treatment now undergoing testing for the prevention, treatment and cure of Alzheimer’s disease as well as other neurological disorders. This innovative technology has been exclusively licensed from USF to Alzamend Neuro™, Inc.

 

Chuanhai Cao, a USF associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences and a researcher at the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute, has focused his research on peptides for use as a vaccine for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological diseases.

 

Dr. Cao has developed an antigen activated immune cell-based vaccine that shows promise in helping combat nervous system dysfunctions in Alzheimer’s disease. Research has shown that the therapeutic vaccine can target the toxic protein in the brain and fix the impaired immune system in several Alzheimer’s mouse models.

 

“Our research team has developed a therapeutic vaccine that can both combat the disease and improve the immune system,” Cao said. “The most recent results have proved that such therapy can improve memory and avoid an unwanted vaccine associated reaction in a mouse model, so it could be a very promising therapeutic for Alzheimer’s disease patients.”

Our Story

“I
remember, like it was just yesterday, my grandmother no longer recognized me
and worse yet, feared me as if I was a stranger. That was my first true
experience of what Alzheimer’s is”. Later I would learn about and experience
more than 6 direct family members systematically consumed by the disease, and
watched helplessly.” – Chairman Milton “Todd” Ault III

Through his personal experience and diligent study of the
status of treatments, and the landscape of medical technology, Mr. Ault, chose
the USF Health/Byrd Alzheimer's Institute and their intellectual property portfolio and formed Alzamend Neuro™ as his
starting point to make a difference. With twenty-five years of experience on Wall
Street at buying and selling companies as an activist, his relentless
passion for business and technology has culminated in a commitment to depart
from the traditional while forging ahead with a disruptive path to financing
the commercialization  and the discovery of future solutions.
Mr. Ault was quick to recognize the opportunity to make a difference in routine
medical procedures that at times resulted in fatal consequences. He founded and
launched Patient Safety Technologies Inc., believing in the impact of bar-coded
sponge technology, long before anyone else would support it. It has now
become the standard of care in operating rooms around the world, saving
countless lives and subsequent lawsuits annually.


Providing a team of Operational and Financial executives with proven track
records, Mr. Ault has assembled an all-star cast to move this vision forward,
without burdening the company with excessive overhead.

“I vividly remember visiting my grandmother one day and not only did she not recognize me, but she feared me as though I were a stranger. Over the years as more than six other family members became affected by the disease, I studied and learned more about its devastating nature. I felt compelled to take action.”
– Chairman Milton “Todd” Ault III
Through his personal experience and diligent study of the status of treatments, and the landscape of medical technology, Mr. Ault, chose the Byrd Institute and their intellectual property, and formed Alzamend as his starting point to make a difference. Twenty-Five years of experience on Wall Street at buying and selling companies as an activist, and his relentless passion for business and technology has culminated in a commitment to depart from the traditional while forging ahead with a disruptive path to financing the commercialization and the discovery of future solutions.
Mr. Ault was quick to recognize the opportunity to make a difference in routine medical procedures that at times resulted in fatal consequences. He founded and launched Patient Safety Technologies Inc., believing in the impact of bar-coded sponge technology, long before anyone else would support it, and it is has now become the standard of care in operating rooms around the world, saving countless lives and subsequent lawsuits annually.
Providing a team of Operational and Financial executives with proven track records, Mr. Ault has made an all-star cast to move this vision forward, without burdening the company with excessive overhead.
Alzamend Neuro is a development stage biotechnology company which has licensed a patented mutant peptide developed by Dr. Chuanhai Cao at the college of Pharmacy of the University of South Florida (USF) and USF- Health Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute to develop a cell based therapeutic vaccine as an immunotherapy to prevent or slowdown Alzheimer’s disease. This therapy is not only target on the pathological molecule that is associated to AD, but also is able to fix the impaired immune system associated to AD development
The USF Health Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute is dedicated to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.
With a state-of-the-art building and a highly qualified team of physicians, memory care specialists, researchers and educators, we are in the forefront of Alzheimer’s research and patient care. The rapid growth of the Institute and the need for groundbreaking approaches to the care and treatment of patients with memory disorders has led us to develop the concept of the Center for Memory C.A.R.E. (Clinical Assessment, Research & Education). The entire second floor of our Institute is a revolutionary Center that provides the most up-to-date diagnostic and caregiving services to patients and their families in One Place.

SALT LAKE CITY, Jan.  09, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alzamend Neuro™, Inc. (Alzamend™ or the “Company”) announced today Willie Aames will serve as its International Spokesperson while joining the team as Creative Advisor. The Company stated that with its recent launch of its Regulation A+ Tier II Offering online at www.AlzamendRegA.com™, it looks forward to the many contributions, inspiration and leadership that Aames will provide. With the Company’s campaign targeted to raise $50MM in new equity capital in less than a full year and able to take investment immediately, the addition of Aames is strategic and notable. On December 8, 2016, the Company was notified by the SEC that it had qualified its Form 1-A Application allowing the Company to move forward with the Offering which will leverage the key component of the Reg. A+ Tier II rules which allow for the solicitation of the general public as well as traditional investors and financial institutions. Photos accompanying this announcement are available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/570b7dcd-e68a-4b5d-b771-da9ca5557598http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e32a3791-ca51-4ce6-9fc3-0f263fac686a A video accompanying this announcement is available athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKl0FtY3AXA   Although Willie Aames has starred in over 22 network series, Aames is best known worldwide for playing the iconic “Tommy Bradford” on the 1970s television series "Eight Is Enough" and Scott Baio’s heartwarming wingman “Buddy Lembeck" on the 1980s television hit series “Charles in Charge.” Aames also went on to star in 6 feature films. During the 1990s and through 2008 Aames developed his marketing skills making a name for himself as an award-winning, platinum-selling writer, producer and director. During this time, Aames successfully developed strategies, scripts and marketing plans for a myriad of companies including Fortune 500 titans Sprint, Northwest Airlines, Marion Labs and Helzberg Diamonds, a Berkshire Hathaway company. Aames also served as executive vice president of Pamplin Communications where he successfully developed several children's shows that became "sell through product" for Sony Wonder, Walmart and Toys"R"Us distribution channels. During the mid-2000s, Aames endured a series of personal setbacks including a personal bankruptcy that left him homeless but became known and revered for his perseverance and resilience. Determined to overcome and learn from his experiences, Aames again made headlines when he became a licensed financial advisor appearing on NBC’s “Today Show." “What I experienced I wouldn’t wish on anyone,” the actor stated, “but once I survived it, I was determined to make a difference in the lives of others.” In talking of the extreme circumstances, he explained: “Those years changed my entire perspective about everything, my world perspective, and my life, its meaning and what my contributions should be.” His success and triumph was celebrated and documented on Oprah Winfrey’s popular hit, “Where are they Now?” Aames’ family has a long history with Alzheimer’s. His paternal grandfather was Dr. Albert Upton, PhD, an acclaimed professor, author and the Dean of the English department and the Head of Russian Literature for Whittier College in Southern California. Dr. Upton pioneered the concept that the IQ of a college freshman could be raised by teaching a course in semantics. The course and the accompanying book were titled “Design for Thinking” which is still in use at Whittier College. Aames spent his early adulthood watching this brilliant educator, who literally “wrote the book on thinking,” slowly succumb to Alzheimer’s. Aames’ grandmother Alleen, who was brilliant in her own right as a biochemist, also passed away due to Alzheimer’s. Armed with his personal experiences in losing two significant family members to AD, Aames has noted his personal quest to effect change and progress while making a difference in others’ lives. Aames expressed an unyielding commitment to use all of his talents for the development and success of Alzamend Neuro™ and to raise awareness of AD. “I believe that any step forward in the fight against Alzheimer’s is a good step, and I can think of no endeavor more worthy to undertake than to help take positive steps towards ending what has been called ‘the most feared disease’.” The Company recommends any investors to read its Form 1-A Offering Statement and other public reports and financial statements that may be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for further information. All public filings, financial statements, management profiles and other Company information are available on the Company’s web site.

                            and over 1100 other popular brands!  Simply add products from these brands to the shopping cart.
                        
World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.


















Global Diversity at iHerb




At iHerb we believe in diversity. Our team members hail from more than 30 nations, and have a broad range of personal and professional backgrounds. As an international company with customers worldwide, we proudly stand behind all of our employees.



In addition to the United States, iHerb California and Kentucky team members come from the following countries:

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are research studies that test or improve ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases. Trials may be designed to study new drugs, surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use or combine existing options. A clinical trial may give you access to innovative therapies or technologies before they are available anywhere else.



Patients at the Stanford Neuroscience Health Center have access to more than 50 clinical trials, many of them available only at Stanford or very few hospitals in the country. If you would like assistance searching for trials, call 650-498-7425.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
