This is one of Makinde's exceptionally good works on paper. The size of this wonderful painting is about 15.5" x 12". It is watercolor and india ink on paper. It was done in 1997. It is unframed.

*born 21 June 1959 in Habana, Cuba *working since 1983 as a freelance artist *wall painting projects, architecturally based art and ceramic projects *lives and works since 1997 in Renchen, Germany

Jaime Makinde comes from Cuba and his roots lies in Africa. He use the traditional materials of art in connection with elements of contempory art and surrealism.

The motives of his work takes the viewer into the world of possibility. In his work one finds fantastic constructions and confusing landscapes with organic formation. Everything seems to be in constant change. It seems to be a dream world. But not only a dream world. The organic life constantly trains itself further - a bizarre machinery of plants, animals and human forms. Between them - the columns of the human rule. Jaime Makinde is active in different kinds of art. His works requests the viewer to dare himself, or herself  to peer into the secrets behind the laws, to open doors, to enter areas or follow floating objects.

floating creatura project constructed by summer camp kidsall images courtesy of beam camp
 
 
 
in the summer of 2014, architecture students federico forestiero and mark torrens were commissioned by beam camp, a new hampshire summer camp, to build a floating vessel that could be operated by children. entitled ‘creatura’, the design takes on the appearance of a living being, gliding ominously across the lake.
 
fitted with manual steering mechanisms, the 16 foot-long structure was built from a combination of woven materials constructed from a prefabricated kit of parts. at the port side of the craft, a human-sized hamster wheel generates the energy required to power the vessel, while a captain stationed in the crow’s nest coordinates the ship’s movement.

The project is a winning proposal for the international competition organised by Beam Camp, a summer Camp in New Hampshire for kids.


The competition sought a project built inside the camp and within a budget of 10’000 $. As a team of two architectural students, we designed a timber floating creature fitted with manual steering mechanisms designed to be operated by children.

From a distance, the structure gives an impression of a living creature moving on the lake. Creatura is made with 3 different mechanisms: the rotating paddles, the human wheel and the cycling paddles. Without any directional bar, the children had to cooperate to follow a specific track coordinated by the capitan who is on the tower to see outside. The rotating paddles is a set of two side mounted paddles with a central metal handle accessible from the interior of the creatura; a simple rotation of the handle activates the paddles. The human wheel is a rotating wheel with a radius of 1.2 meters with 8 stepping divisions; the motion of walking on the steps activate the rotation of the wheel and move the creatura forward. The cycling paddles is made of recycled bicycle frames and pedals connected to the paddles in the water; foot pedalling motion activates the paddles. 




Federico Forestiero & Mark David Torrens, Creatura Project. Photo Danny Kahn








One of the main briefs of the competition was to design an easy and simple construction method which can be adopted by children builders. With this in mind, the project was constructed with prefabricated kit of parts and the construction process last only 3 weeks. Main structural parts consist of laminated plywood ribs as the primary structure and 2x10 timber deck frame as the floating raft combined with 24 plastic barrels. The cladding of the frame is in thin strips of western red cedar, which were easily bent into shape in situ.
