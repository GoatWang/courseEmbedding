Exclusive Interview with Mark Massey of AltaRock Partners - BeyondProxy














































































  Exclusive Interview with Mark Massey of AltaRock Partners






Last year we had the pleasure of interviewing Mark Massey who heads AltaRock Partners. Under Mark’s leadership, the AltaRock Fund has compounded capital at a net annual rate of 12% since inception over twelve years ago, more than 500 basis points ahead of the annual performance of the S&P 500 Index.
The Manual of Ideas: How did you get interested in investing?
Mark Massey: Like any son, I was greatly influenced by my Dad. Fortunately for me, one of his real passions in life was investing. He always talked about his stocks around the dinner table and as time went by his enthusiasm stoked a curiosity in me to learn more. During high school and college, I got non-paying “jobs” at the local Merrill Lynch office which gave me some important insights into the ecosystem of Wall Street. By the time I graduated from college in 1986, I had decided that I wanted to be on the “buy side of the street.” Thankfully, with a bit of patience and perseverance, I was able to land a dream job as an equity analyst with Fidelity Investments in Boston.
MOI: Why wide-moat investing as opposed to other value approaches?
Massey: We think it’s a very safe way to generate superior returns over the long term. “Wide-moat investing” is just another way of saying that we try to buy, at a rational price, great businesses whose earnings are almost certain to be much higher in ten and twenty years. Great businesses, by definition, stand the test of time and as a consequence they are always compounding in value — like a savings account, but with a much better yield.
To me, deep value “investing” means buying a less than great business or a pile of assets trapped inside of a corporation at a (hopefully) big discount to some estimate of intrinsic worth. My problem with this approach is that no matter how cheaply you buy, time is working against you. In other words, your risk/return equation is highly dependent upon how quickly you can turn around and sell at a profit. With poor companies and cheap assets, the values can melt away while you are waiting for the market to see things your way. Buffett said it well, “Time is the friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the mediocre.”
MOI: Absent general calamities such as in 2008-09, what are your favorite sources of mispricings that lead to wide-moat companies being undervalued? How do you then increase your chances of distinguishing between permanent versus temporary impairments of a company’s moat?
Massey: Every situation is different, but mispricings tend to occur due to some innate disregard (recent spin-off, small market cap, etc), or because of some uncertainty, or fear. So you pointed out one of the best times to find them, which is when there is a general panic in financial markets. Other types of uncertainty and fear can be specific to a sector (housing related businesses following the real-estate bubble), or around various characteristics like high debt levels, legal problems, etc. The best mispricings will generally occur when you have a combination of factors working simultaneously. Imagine a 2008 spin-off of a highly leveraged, housing-related business facing new legal problems that are difficult to estimate. That will be a very cheap stock that may be worth spending time on. As far as knowing when an issue is temporary or permanent, I don’t have any shortcuts or rules-of-thumb. Every situation is different and it always comes down to a matter of hard work, experience and healthy dose of common sense. I will say that our success has come almost exclusively from patiently waiting around for things that are obvious to us than from getting involved with difficult and complicated problems.
MOI: How do you generate wide-moat investment ideas?
Massey: It’s all qualitative stuff. We really don’t do screens. In fact, the only screen that I find useful is one that spits out companies that have been buying back a high percentage of shares. This MAY be indicative of a well-aligned management team that has great conviction in the durability of its competitive moat… but it could be the opposite, too… so you always have to do a lot of work to get to the truth.
I really think the key to our success has to do with our love for the game. We absolutely love coming to work every day. I literally spend almost all of my time reading. And while it, no doubt, makes me a bit of an oddball, my greatest pleasure is to be constantly searching for wonderful businesses that, for whatever reason, are mispriced. Having done this for nearly thirty years, I have built up a lot of knowledge and understanding about many different businesses, moats and business models. The result is a long list of companies that we would like to own at the right price. And we know from experience that if we continue to be patient and disciplined, a few mouth-watering opportunities will eventually come our way.
MOI: You refer to your portfolio as a “Conglomerate.” Please elaborate.
Massey: I realize it sounds kind of funny, but we really do refer to our portfolio in-house and in our letters to partners as “The AltaRock Conglomerate.” The reason we do this is to reinforce what we believe is the correct way of thinking about stocks, which after all are ownership positions in real operating businesses. I think many investors can lose sight of this when all they ever see are ticker symbols and flashing prices on a computer screen. To counter this tendency, we think of, and speak of, each business in our portfolio as a subsidiary that we own outright. And we try to acquire each one at a price that reduces our risk of loss to zero, while also guaranteeing that our rewards from long-term ownership will be bountiful. If we truly ran a conglomerate, we would always be exceedingly careful that we understood exactly what we were buying before making any acquisition. And we would never sell or trade one of our subsidiaries unless we were absolutely convinced that we were getting significantly more than we were giving up. The only exception to this would be if someone offered us an insanely inflated price, in which case we would sell and hold the proceeds in cash until we could find something intelligent to do. Just because we deal in marketable securities does not mean that we should behave any differently than we would if we owned entire businesses, so we don’t.
MOI: Your portfolio is one of the most concentrated we have come across. Do you target a specific number of “subsidiaries?” Could you also tell us how you came to embrace such a focused investment philosophy?
Massey: There is no target, but most of the time we end up owning between five and ten businesses (stocks) at any one time, and we really try to buy for keeps. Right now we own seven “subsidiaries” and I’d say that’s pretty typical.
As for AltaRock’s investment philosophy, I am afraid I can’t take much credit. We really just copied it from Warren (Buffett) and Charlie (Munger). And I think they borrowed it from Phil Fisher and Lord (John Maynard) Keynes. Buffett likes to joke that the wisdom of concentrating in one’s best ideas has been around since 600BC when Aesop uttered, the now famous words, “A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.”
While I had always been drawn to concentrated, wide-moat investing, there was an important crystallization moment for me. Back in January 2002 my wife and I decided to squeeze in a quick vacation before the coming birth of our second child and the April launch of AltaRock. So there I was, sitting on the beach in Jamaica with my wonderful wife and our beautiful three-year-old daughter… and I start reading this book, The Warren Buffett Way, by Robert Hagstrom…and I am literally dumbstruck. Buffett’s words really spoke to my investment soul. I was so excited by what I read… and I wanted more. So when we returned from vacation, I literally spent the next two months reading everything I could get my hands on about Buffett and Munger… every book, every Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report, every yearend Buffett Partnership letter, every speech, etc.
Among the many things I learned from all this reading were three important facts: 1) The most highly regarded investor(s) of all time preached incessantly that it was pure madness for professional investors to own much more than a handful of positions, 2) most investment businesses were either unaware of this or had chosen to ignore it, and 3) over the long-term, most of them fail to beat the market. I find these three things as fascinating today as I did 12 years ago.
MOI: Would you mind sharing a few of your current ideas with us?
Massey: We really like our portfolio, and while it could do anything in the short term, over the next decade we think we will do quite well. Our top three positions (as of June 24th) are MasterCard/Visa, Moody’s, and Liberty Global.
That’s four names, so just to be clear, we group MasterCard and Visa together because we think of them as one position. We have owned MasterCard since 2007 and we picked up Visa when the world blew up in 2008. It’s probably tempting to think that these stocks are not worth owning anymore since they have done so well for so long. But we think they are still undervalued. Remarkably, despite the size of these businesses, they are still the fastest growing companies that we own. We think they will continue to grow at above average rates for a long time, which is a very rare and valuable quality.
These businesses possess enviable network-effects on a global basis. It’s almost impossible to start a new credit card network today. And as you know, with network-effects, bigger is better and smaller is dead or dying. Over time the world has come to be increasingly dominated by just a few payment networks, and these are the two largest. They grow as people increasingly turn to the convenience and efficiency of electronic payments vs. less efficient and cumbersome cash and checks. The road ahead continues to look long and promising since 85% of global consumer spending is still done the inefficient, old-fashioned way. This inexorably changes a bit every day.
MasterCard and Visa continue to organically grow their top lines by 10-15% per year. Earnings grow a little faster since the costs are largely fixed. We continually have a difficult time finding anything better than these businesses and we believe we will earn 14-15% IRR’s from here (MA $73, V $208) over the next ten years.
MOI: Moody’s has had some challenges to its moat – when did you first purchase Moody’s and how do you asses its moat today?
Massey: We bought Moody’s in March of last year, but we had owned it for years following its spin-off from Dun & Bradstreet. We reluctantly sold it in 2007 when we grew increasingly concerned that rating agencies might be blamed by regulators and/or the courts for billions of dollars in losses, if not the entire financial meltdown. Moody’s and S&P have great moats, so we kept in touch with the idea, reassessing the situation periodically after our sale.
We were able to get comfortable with the regulatory risk much sooner than the legal risk. It was easier for us to understand the regulatory response, which ended up being fairly benign, but gaining comfort with the potential legal fallout was much tougher. We spent months reading various court documents and legal opinions. We spent hours questioning management, especially the head of the legal team. We interviewed former employees, with a particular focus on the ones that had less than flattering things to say. We went through insider ownership positions, past and present, with a fine tooth comb, etc. Suffice it to say we are quite comfortable now.
As far as the business itself is concerned… we think Moody’s has one of the world’s great business moats. We see Moody’s and S&P as the market-anointed, global referees of debt capital markets. Some businesses naturally tend toward winner-takes—all and this is one of them. Governments, private companies, and citizens around the world need to have an independent third party that verifies the credit-worthiness of borrowing entities. Regulators need these opinions. Contracts among different entities depend on these opinions, etc., etc. Credit market participants generally prefer to have two opinions rather than just one, and the markets long ago settled on these two firms (with Fitch sometimes as a weaker number three). Consequently, they enjoy a network-effect that makes them very difficult to displace.
I don’t know if this is clear? Let me try to explain it a little better. So senior financial executives that desire access to debt capital markets for their companies need to maintain a fairly close relationship with ratings agencies. They need to keep them abreast of any actions that their companies have taken, or might take, that could impact their credit profile. Obviously these executives do not want to spend their entire lives meeting with lots of different ratings agencies, so it is in their interests for there to be just a couple, well-established, ubiquitous firms. Meanwhile, because of this, debt investors (the buyers) subscribe to the credit data products of the two dominant firms (Moody’s, S&P), which further reinforces the decision by debt issuers to employ Moody’s and S&P when selling new debt. And around it goes in a self-reinforcing circle…so, while it may not be perfect, the system naturally snowballs toward one co-referee team (S&P and Moody’s) on the field. Consequently, no new ratings agency has had much, if any, success breaking into this club, and we don’t see it changing.
Despite being over 100 years old, Moody’s is still growing its revenues organically at a double-digit rate. We think this will be sustained for a while – at least another ten years. The business essentially grows with global GDP, but faster since the capital markets are continuing to slowly take market share from the banking industry as intermediaries of credit. In addition to this we (shareholders) also enjoy an underpriced product, which is a tremendous hidden treasure, if you can ever find one. Buffett and Munger found one when they bought See’s Candy. And Michael Eisner found one when he took over as CEO at Disney. He discovered that prices could be raised faster than inflation for many years at the Magic Kingdom with no discernable falloff in traffic. We believe Moody’s has this kind of power and that management will continue to judiciously exercise it.
Like MasterCard and Visa, Moody’s costs are also largely fixed so earnings will grow a bit faster for a while. And as with most of our investments, management at Moody’s will be returning at least 100% of free cash flow to us via stock buybacks and dividends. In any event, we think that Moody’s ($87) will generate a 15% IRR for us over the coming decade.
MOI: What’s your thesis on Liberty Global? How do you assess its moat?
Massey: This is a position that we added last fall. We like this one a lot, too. As you probably know, Liberty Global is controlled by its chairman, Dr. John Malone. It can be thought of in many respects as following the lead set by Comcast, but in Europe. Incidentally, much of what people know as Comcast (and many other pieces of the U.S. cable industry) was, in fact, built by Dr. Malone and his team at Telecommunications Incorporated. As in the United States with Comcast, in each of Liberty’s markets, there are only two competing wires into most residences and small businesses for purposes of connecting to the outside digital world (phone, TV, Internet). Generally speaking the newest, best, future-proof, wire is owned by cable companies and the oldest, inferior one is owned by the incumbent national telephone company. Liberty’s product (two-way connectivity) is not only faster and better, but also cheaper than the competition, which is why the company will continue to grow. As the number of screens (TVs, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, watches, eyeglasses, etc.) proliferates, the demand for increased Internet bandwidth for TV/video everywhere continues to accelerate. This situation increasingly benefits the owners of the cable plant.
Additionally, as Liberty Global continues to consolidate cable systems in Europe, shareholders will benefit from increasing economies of scale. Moreover, because the most capital intensive period for the business is in the past (i.e. digging up the streets and laying two-way fiber/coax), shareholders are also now enjoying quickly growing free cash flow, which further benefits from a tax shield due to the previously incurred losses from the high cost of laying all that fiber. What’s more, John Malone, in addition to being a talented scientist, entrepreneur and businessman, is truly one of the world’s hall-of-fame allocators of capital. He is laser-focused on increasing per share equity value and his mind is not polluted by empire building for its own sake. We believe this company is well positioned and has a long runway in which to grow its free cash flow at much faster rates than global GDP. We see a next decade IRR here of 15% as well (LBTYK $41).
Another interesting aspect of this story, which is not included in the above IRR estimate, is the fact that Liberty is in the process of turning each of its 15 million (and growing) customers’ modems into WIFI hotspots that can be easily and securely accessed by all of its other customers as they travel outside of their homes and businesses. If customers come to enjoy the use of this free and growing WIFI network, Liberty’s already well-protected economic fortress will become all the tougher to infiltrate and its intrinsic value will likely grow a bit faster than expected.
In addition to rolling out this WIFI network, Liberty is also simultaneously setting up mobile MVNO “Mobile Virtual Network Operator” partnership agreements with select mobile operators in its various European markets so that it can begin selling mobile service under its own customer service/billing platform. Right now over 90% of people’s data usage on their mobile devices (phones, tablets and laptops browsing the web and particularly watching videos) is done in-home via WIFI, and not on cellular networks because they are either too slow, too expensive, or both. In addition, over 50% of mobile voice traffic takes place inside and could also potentially be offloaded onto WIFI to save people money. Liberty thinks it can marry these two networks (mobile, cable/fiber) together (via MVNO partnerships) more seamlessly and create not only a better consumer experience, but also a better value.
Whether or not Liberty is correct, we find it interesting that in 2010, Japan’s second largest mobile operator bought Japan’s largest cable business….and last year, Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile operator, bought Germany’s largest cable business for $10 billion… and this year Vodafone is buying Spain’s largest cable business for another $10 billion. It appears that mobile-only companies are increasingly scrambling to own superior, high-speed, fiber-based cable businesses. So stay tuned…
MOI: Taking John Malone as a proxy for great capital allocators/investors…do you think great investors are born or can you become one with hard work? What key attributes are necessary for success?
Massey: I think you can learn a lot of it, but you probably won’t unless it really appeals to you. I think Charlie Munger said that he has never met anyone wise in any field that did not read all the time, and that is certainly true of great investors. They read and read and read, and of course nobody could sustain that kind of reading about anything unless they found it incredibly fascinating. So I think you need to be someone who finds businesses extremely interesting. And you have to have an innate curiosity about everything, wanting to know the truth about how things really work. So I think there needs to be a little scientist inside of you. I think you also need to have a personality that tends toward rationality, particularly in situations where most people’s decision-making becomes polluted by emotion – like when all hell is breaking loose and the market is going down fast, every day. You also need to really know yourself, meaning that you need to be aware of, and completely okay with, your own limitations. Otherwise you are likely to start doing things outside of your circle of competence. If you are someone who tends to fool yourself into believing that you know more than you really do, you are going to run into trouble in the investment realm. Also, believe it or not, feeling comfortable doing nothing for a long time is important. This requires a lot of self-conviction, as there are lots of psychological forces, both external and internal, conspiring you toward action when, in fact, much of the time sitting tight is the most sensible thing to do.
I am also reminded of comments by Seth Klarman and George Soros. Seth once said that you need to have a certain arrogance to be an investor, which is true. If you think about it, every time you buy or sell, there is somebody on the other side of the transaction that thinks he’s right. So you have to be somewhat arrogant to think you know more than that other guy all the time. But then George Soros…when an interviewer referred to him as a security analyst, he laughed and said that he felt more like an insecurity analyst. He went on to explain that whenever he bought a new position he was always terrified that he was going to be proven wrong. So before buying anything, he did an incredible amount of work, and after investing he was always checking his facts, and he kept on trying to learn as much as possible about whatever it was – all because of his fear of being exposed as a fool. And so, counter-intuitively, I think both of these concepts are right. You need to be arrogant and insecure at the same time.
MOI: What do you think is the biggest mistake that investors make?
Massey: Several things come to mind as I think about it… making emotional decisions… short-term thinking instead of long… a lack of thoroughness in due diligence… These are all issues, but I think the best answer to the question is a little more subtle… and it’s that most investors fail to properly weigh and adequately take into account that they are players in a pari-mutuel betting game.
So you probably know what I mean by that, but let me elaborate. So most people know how horse betting works, right? So before the race begins, all the bets are tallied up, and based upon all the bets, the odds are calculated… and so what ends up happening is that the top horses – the ones with the best pedigrees, the best jockeys, and the best track records – end up paying out very little profit when they win, which is most of the time. And while the payoff can be great when the worst horses win, the fact is, they rarely do.
Investing is very much the same. Great businesses – the ones that have demonstrated competitive advantages and which have enjoyed long records of success – are almost always priced very expensively, while poor businesses are almost always correctly cheap. Consequently, it is hard to do better than average betting on either. The secret to winning in horses and in securities is the same. You need to study like mad and be really patient. Every now and then you will come across a really great business (or horse) that for one reason or another is mispriced, sometimes severely so, and this is when you invest (make a bet). The rest of the time you just keep working hard and waiting. You only bet when you are convinced that you have a near cinch.
If you try to force the action by making a rule like, “I am going to bet on every race to diversify my bets” or “I need to own a certain number of stocks, no matter what”, then all you are doing is lowering your chances of winning because you are, in effect, simultaneously lowering return and adding risk. By the way, the only two risks that we care about are 1) the chance of permanently losing money due to mistaken analysis, and 2) the risk of our returns not keeping up with inflation over the long haul.
MOI: Do you follow any investment rules, guidelines or checklists?
Massey: The only rule we have is that we must invest all of our own money in the fund so that we are as aligned as humanly possible, both on the upside and on the downside, with our partners. From there we simply invest how we see fit based upon the quality and price of what we can find and understand. The only guideline that we have is to ask ourselves this question before investing a dime, “Are you willing and eager to put 25% of your own net worth into this company (stock) for the next ten years, even if the market were closed that entire time?” This question has been an incredibly useful tool for keeping us focused on the right things.
We are very risk-averse investors and are always thinking about how we could lose money. We try to protect ourselves: by doing thorough research until we are confident we know what we are getting in return for our money; by buying things for a fraction of their true worth: the net present value of their cash flow; by using reasonable, but conservative assumptions; by partnering with management teams that have real skin in the game like we do, and who have demonstrated repeatedly with their actions that they can be trusted to look after our interests; by staying away from anything but very high quality businesses; by avoiding companies whose accounting we cannot understand; and finally by staying humble about how much we really know and constantly seeking more and better information about the important things that will drive future company fundamentals.
MOI: Are there any books or other investment resources that have helped you become a better wide-moat investor?
Massey: For someone starting out I would submerge myself in as much Munger and Buffett as possible and I would certainly subscribe to The Manual of Ideas. Here are some books, etc. that I have found quite interesting and useful:

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
