To assist all shareholders of GI Dynamics, a list of Frequently Asked Questions is set out below. 
Important Notice: The information in this document does not take into account your individual investment objectives, financial situation and needs. The information in this document is of a general nature and is not financial product advice and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for any investment decision. Shareholders should consult their financial, legal or tax adviser before deciding to buy or sell CDIs in GI Dynamics. Your adviser may ask you for the GI Dynamics’ ISIN number. For your reference, GI Dynamics’ ISIN number is AU000000GID7.Display all AnswersWhat is a CHESS depositary interest or CDI?The electronic transfer system used on ASX, known as 'CHESS', cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of foreign companies. Accordingly, to enable companies such as GI Dynamics to have their securities cleared and settled electronically through CHESS, depositary instruments called CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs) are issued.What is a share of common stock?Shares of common stock are the U.S. equivalent of ordinary shares in an Australian company. GI Dynamics is incorporated in the United States and hence has common stock on issue.What is the ratio of shares of common stock to CDIs?Each CDI represents an interest in 1/50th of an underlying share of GI Dynamics’ common stock.How is GI Dynamics’ common stock held?In the United States, your common stock is held on either a certificated basis or an uncertified (book-entry) basis. The American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC (AST) is the transfer agent for the Company’s common stock.How are GI Dynamics’ CDIs held?In Australia, CDIs are held on an uncertificated basis. Holders of CDIs will be issued a holding statement (which will set out details of the number of CDIs you hold in GI Dynamics) and an identification reference. There are no physical share certificates issued. Link Market Services Limited is the Company’s share registry for CDIs listed in Australia.Can I convert my CDIs into common stock? What forms do I need and is there a fee?Yes, you can convert some or all of your CDIs into common stock at any time. CDI holders who wish to convert their ASX-listed CDIs to shares of common stock can do so by instructing the Company’s share registry, Link Market Services Limited either:directly, in the case of CDIs, on the issuer sponsored sub-register operated by the Company. CDI holders will be provided with a “Notice of Transmutation” for completion and return to the Company’s share registry; orthrough their sponsoring participant (usually their broker) in the case of CDIs that are sponsored on the CHESS sub-register. In this case, the sponsoring broker will arrange for completion of the relevant form and its return to the Company’s share registry.
  The Company’s share registry will then arrange for the shares underlying the CDIs which are to be converted to be transferred into the name of that holder and a book-entry advice (which will set out details of the number of shares of common stock you hold in GI Dynamics) will be issued by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC who is the transfer agent for the Company's common stock. This will cause the shares to be registered in the name of the holder on the Company’s share register and trading on ASX will no longer be possible. The shares are not and will not in the near future be quoted on any market in the U.S. or elsewhere. Any shares so issued will bear restrictive legends in accordance with U.S. law. 
  The Company’s share registry will not charge an individual security holder a fee for converting CDI holdings into shares (although a fee will be payable by market participants). It is expected that this process will be completed within 2 days, provided that the share registry is in receipt of a duly completed and valid Notice of Transmutation. However, no guarantee can be given about the time for this conversion to take place. If the shares are listed on a U.S. securities exchange in the future, a fee may be payable for entering the shares into the DTC or DRS system. Contact Link Market Services:

What forms do I need, and is there a fee?Yes, you can convert some or all of your shares of common stock into CDIs at any time. If holders of the common stock shares wish to convert their holdings to CDIs, they can do so by contacting the Company’s U.S. transfer agent (American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC (AST)) for the common stock. AST will provide shareholders with a “Notice of Transmutation” for completion and return to AST, which will ultimately also be provided to the Company’s share registry (Link Market Services Limited) to complete the process.

  Email: info@amstock.comWhat is GI Dynamics' ISIN number? GI Dynamics’ ISIN number is AU000000GID7 Are my CDIs freely tradable on ASX? What is the “FOR US” designation?Yes, your CDIs are freely tradable on ASX except to U.S. persons, who are not currently permitted to acquire CDIs in GI Dynamics. The CDIs issued to investors under the public offer were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 for offers made outside the U.S. Accordingly, the CDIs have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the laws of any state or jurisdiction of the U.S. As a result, the CDIs are "restricted securities" and cannot be sold into the U.S. or to a U.S. person for a period of 12 months from the date of allotment, unless the CDIs are registered or an exemption is available. 
  In order to ensure that U.S. persons do not purchase any CDIs issued under the public offer, a number of procedures governing the trading and clearing of CDIs have been implemented, including the application to CDIs of the status of Foreign Ownership Restriction (FOR) securities under the ASX Settlement Operating Rules and the addition of the notation "FOR US" to the CDI description on ASX trading screens and elsewhere, which will inform the market of the prohibition on U.S. persons acquiring CDIs. Where can I access the current stock price for ASX?GI Dynamics’ ASX price for CDIs is available at www.asx.com.au or via the Overview page in the Investors section of this website.How do new investors buy GI Dynamics securities?New investors can buy CDIs on the ASX through an Australian broker. Investors may then convert between CDIs and common stock as described in Questions 6 and 7 above. When is the ASX market open?The ASX is open for trading from 10.00am to 4.00pm Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) on Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays.How do I receive GI Dynamics’ announcements on ASX?Announcements will be posted on the ASX (www.asx.com) and to the ASX Announcements section of this website. Announcements and all press releases can be accessed on this website or by subscribing to receive them by email when they are posted. (See email alert section of Investor pages on website.)

GI Dynamics, Inc. Provides 2017 Business Outlook and 2016 Review | Business Wire
























































      GI Dynamics, Inc. Provides 2017 Business Outlook and 2016 Review
    





January 11, 2017 09:13 AM Eastern Standard Time



BOSTON & SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GI 
      Dynamics, Inc., (ASX:GID), a medical device company that has 
      commercialized EndoBarrier® in Europe for patients with type 2 diabetes 
      and obesity, today released a 2017 business outlook and recap of 2016 
      accomplishments.
    


      2017 marks the first full calendar year with the company’s new 
      management team following the 2016 appointment of Scott Schorer as 
      president and CEO. Schorer subsequently appointed industry veteran Jim 
      Murphy as chief financial officer and Brian Callahan as chief compliance 
      officer to help usher in a new era and re-establish key corporate 
      priorities in driving commercial growth of EndoBarrier®, the first 
      endoscopically-delivered device therapy for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes and obesity. In addition, Dan Moore, an experienced medical 
      device executive, was named chairman last year, and Oern Stuge, MD, MBA, 
      was appointed to the board at the beginning of the 2017.
    

      “There is a significant need for effective therapeutic options for the 
      more than 300 million patients worldwide with type 2 diabetes and 
      obesity,” said Schorer. “With more than 3,700 implants shipped as of 
      year-end 2016, and a growing body of evidence demonstrating meaningful 
      reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and weight, our focus this 
      year is on enhancing commercialization in the United Kingdom, Germany 
      and the Middle East, building on and harnessing the growing body of 
      efficacy and safety data, and continuing dialogue with the FDA toward 
      U.S. regulatory approval.”
    

      Priorities for 2017 include the following:
    


        GI Dynamics will support commercialization, market access and 
        reimbursement efforts underway in the United Kingdom, Germany, the 
        Middle East, and select European countries.
      

        GI Dynamics will continue building relationships with regulatory 
        agencies in Europe and the United States, especially as the company 
        finalizes the protocol for its pivotal U.S. investigational device 
        exemption (IDE) trial in anticipation of initiating and beginning to 
        enroll the trial this year.
      

        GI Dynamics will raise capital to secure funding for executing U.S. 
        clinical development and commercial plans.
      

        GI Dynamics will establish a scientific advisory board comprised of 
        leading experts in treatment and management options for patients with 
        type 2 diabetes and obesity to aid both clinical development and 
        commercial strategies.
      

        GI Dynamics will bolster the efficacy and safety profile for 
        EndoBarrier with presentations and publications based on data 
        generated from multiple post-marketing and investigator-initiated 
        studies.
      

        GI Dynamics will continue to evolve and add to its team.
      


Highlights from 2016


      The new leadership team began work immediately by slashing costs across 
      the board to stabilize the company and extend the cash runway through 
      the end of Q3 2017. A $1.1 million placement on the ASX in December 
      together with a Security Purchase Plan (SPP) investment vehicle, which 
      is still in process, should allow us sufficient capital to operate the 
      company through the end of 2017. The company expects to continue to 
      operate on a lean basis with regard to cash burn.
    

      In 2016, GI Dynamics made promising clinical advancements through 
      continued support of investigator-initiated studies worldwide and 
      strengthened regulatory relationships with the FDA and its European 
      Notified Body.
    

      The company also announced positive data demonstrating improved outcomes 
      in both A1c and weight reduction as well as reinforcing the EndoBarrier 
      safety profile. In addition to revamping the management team, the 
      company made significant strides in streamlining operations and reducing 
      expenses.
    

      Specific accomplishments include the following:
    


        GI Dynamics continued to build its intellectual property protection 
        around EndoBarrier—the company was granted a total of eight allowances 
        for patents from the U.S. Patent Office and the European Patent Office.
      

        GI Dynamics presented data from the German EndoBarrier Registry during 
        the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of 
        Diabetes from 234 patients showing clinically relevant results. Data 
        indicated a lowering of the absolute A1c mean from 8.5 percent to 7.2 
        percent in concert with a lowering of antidiabetic medication in 78 
        percent of patients while reducing the dose of insulin by 42 percent 
        on a mean basis.
      

        GI Dynamics presented results of the ENDO Trial at the American 
        Diabetes Association’s (ADA’s) 76th Scientific Sessions that 
        demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in A1c levels and 
        weight reduction compared with the sham-treated group. These outcomes 
        were achieved with only 325 of the planned 500 subjects being 
        randomized into the trial because the company halted the trial due to 
        a higher than anticipated rate of hepatic abscess (HA). The overall 
        safety profile was positive, and of note, no adverse events led to 
        long-term sequelae or mortality. The data presented included the 
        following:

        

            statistically and clinically significant efficacy—1.1 percent 
            absolute reduction in HbA1c;
          

            statistically and clinically significant efficacy—7.7 percent 
            reduction in body weight; and
          

            data showed that 34.8 percent of patients achieved the ADA target 
            of A1c ≤ 7.0 percent after 12 months.
          




      The company expects to continue releasing new clinical information on a 
      regular basis throughout 2017.
    

      “Building on this clinically meaningful data and developing and 
      enhancing relationships with investigators, providers and patients will 
      help continue to expand the clinical support for EndoBarrier and help 
      expand access to treatment,” said Schorer. “We are well on our way 
      towards achieving the clinical, regulatory, commercial and operational 
      goals we set out to accomplish at the outset and look forward to sharing 
      that news with the market.”

      development and commercialization plans, potential revenues and revenue 
      growth, costs, excess inventory, profitability and financial 
      performance, ability to obtain reimbursement for our products, clinical 
      trials and associated regulatory submissions and approvals, the number 
      and location of commercial centers offering the EndoBarrier, and our

      estimates are subject to several risks and uncertainties that could 
      cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those 
      indicated in or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks 
      and uncertainties include but are not limited to, risks associated with 
      the consequences of terminating the ENDO trial and the possibility that 
      future clinical trials will not be successful or confirm earlier 
      results. Further risks are associated with obtaining funding from third 
      parties; the timing and costs of clinical trials; the timing of

      benefits of our products, product pricing, timing of product launches, 
      future financial results and other factors, including those described in 
      our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Given 
      these uncertainties, one should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to publicly 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
      new information or future events or otherwise, unless we are required to 
      do so by law.
