Publika
For this project, I chose to rebrand Publika, a tea and coffee shop in Dinkytown, Minneapolis. As a shop that primarily serves students, I wanted to create a fun and fresh brand. Not only is it inspired by their most popular product, bubble tea, but also by the edgy environment of the shop.
















































Dragon Tattoo
This redesign encompasses several themes from the novel through the use of framed dried flowers, including time and mystery. The decision of creating a minimalistic cover was made to contrast with the complexity of one of the main characters, Lisbeth Salander. Different groupings of text are organized by type treatment, color, and space.


















Spiced
As an avid chai tea drinker, it was no surprise that I decided to package chai tea lattes for my beverage project. Since there aren't many chai latte products on the market, it was fun to create SPICED, a company that could fill that hole. 






























North Star Shrimp
North Star Shrimp is a new start up company that is farming and raising shrimp in Minnesota. The owners came to me asking for a fresh-looking identity that incorporated blues and crustacean salmon-type colors. The end result is a clean, yet approachable, identity that will sell the premium Minnesota grown seafood in higher-end grocery stores.
























Tracks
When we were assigned to create a product that had single servings, I took the opportunity to create a product geared towards kids. Tracks Trail Packs are single servings of trail mix meant for healthy kids on the run.
























Levels
The visualization shows a sample of people I have met throughout my life and how connected they are to me. By following the key, you will see when we met, how long it has been since we have interacted, and the number of social networks that we follow eachother on.
