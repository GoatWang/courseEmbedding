Kayana Szymczak for The Boston Globe
F. Thomson Leighton.



By most measures, Akamai Technologies Inc. had a successful year in 2014. Net income was up 14 percent, revenue up 24 percent. So the company’s board rewarded the chief executive, F. Thomson Leighton, by doubling his bonus — to $2.Leighton, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg or the late Apple Inc. chief Steve Jobs, takes a salary of $1 per year. But despite the fact that his cash compensation amounted to $3 last year, don’t expect to find him shopping at Family Dollar. According to Akamai’s proxy statement, filed Thursday, Leighton took home stock worth $7.5 million, up from the $6 million in stock he got in 2013.

Akamai runs a global data network that speeds the delivery of Internet content for major websites worldwide.Other Akamai executives got notable raises, much of it in cash. The president of worldwide operations, Robert Hughes, and the president of products and development, Rick McConnell, 
earned more than $510,000 in salary. But each also collected about $3 million in Akamai stock as well as almost $900,000 in incentive compensation.

Akamai’s proxy says that Leighton’s compensation takes into consideration his “past compensation history, his significant equity holdings, peer group practices, and the desire to include significant performance-based vehicles as the majority of his pay package.” 
According to Bloomberg, Leighton’s “significant” Akamai holdings are worth $223 million.The tradition of the “dollar-a-year man” began during World War I, when top executives took government jobs at virtually no salary to help the war effort. Some high-profile executives continued the tradition in the private sector, but they almost always supplement their skimpy paychecks with ample grants of stocks, options, and other financial benefits.Hiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.

Dr. Tom Leighton 

















Chief Executive Officer 




Dr. Tom Leighton co-founded Akamai Technologies in 1998, and served as Akamai’s Chief Scientist for 14 years before becoming Chief Executive. Dr. Leighton is Akamai's technology visionary and leads the senior management team in setting the company's strategic direction, while engaging directly with customers and partners from around the globe. He is also a member of the Board of Directors. 


As one of the world's preeminent authorities on algorithms for network applications, Dr. Leighton's work behind establishing Akamai was based on recognizing that a solution to freeing up web congestion could be found in applied mathematics and algorithms. Akamai has demonstrated this through the creation of the world's largest distributed computing platform that dynamically routes content and applications across a network of more than 200,000 servers in over 110 countries and more than 1,400 networks around the world. Dr. Leighton's technology achievements at Akamai earned him recognition as one of the Top 10 Technology Innovators in U.S. News & World Report. 


Prior to his role as CEO of Akamai, Dr. Leighton was also a Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). 


Dr. Leighton holds numerous patents involving content delivery, Internet protocols, algorithms for networks, cryptography and digital rights management. During the course of his career, he has served on dozens of government, industrial and academic review committees; program committees; and editorial boards. He is a former two-term chair of the 2,000-member Association of Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Complexity Theory, and a former two-term editor-in-chief of the Journal of the ACM. From 2003 to 2005, Dr. Leighton served on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC), during which time he chaired the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity. Dr. Leighton is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences. 


Dr. Leighton has published more than 100 research papers, and his leading text on parallel algorithms and architectures has been translated into several languages. Dr. Leighton graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a B.S. in Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT.

Frank Thomson "Tom" Leighton is a professor of Applied Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the CEO of Akamai Technologies.[1] He has served as the head of the Algorithms group at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory since 1996, and co-founded Akamai with student Daniel Lewin in 1998. He served on the Presidential Informational Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC), during which time he served as the chair of subcommittee on cybersecurity.[2] In 1974, while a senior in high school, he was named one of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search Finalists (now the Intel STS), going on to take home the 2nd place award behind Eric Lander, now a colleague of Leighton's at MIT. Leighton received his B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 1978, and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT in 1981. His brother David T. Leighton is a full professor at the University of Notre Dame, specializing in transport phenomena.[3] He serves on the Board of Trustees of the Society for Science & the Public (SSP) and of the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE), and he has participated in the Distinguished Lecture Series at CEE's flagship program for high school students, the Research Science Institute (RSI). Leighton's father was a friend and Navy colleague of RSI founder Hyman G. Rickover.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
