Arlon Food and Agriculture Partners Acquires Wholesome Sweeteners






April 19, 2012 07:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arlon Group (Arlon), an investment firm focused on food and agriculture, 
      announced that Arlon Food and Agriculture Partners LP, in partnership 
      with management and Edward Billington & Son (Billington), has acquired 
      Wholesome Sweeteners. Wholesome Sweeteners is headquartered in Sugar 
      Land, Texas and is the leading supplier of organic and Fair Trade 
      certified sweeteners in North America. Nigel Willerton, CEO of Wholesome 
      Sweeteners, will continue to lead the management team.
    


      Wholesome Sweeteners was founded in 2001 as a joint venture between 
      Imperial Sugar Company and Billington. Under the leadership of CEO Nigel 
      Willerton, the company has grown to become the leading organic sweetener 
      supplier in North America. Wholesome Sweeteners has a strong track 
      record of innovation which includes new products for 2012 such as 
      Organic Stevia, Organic Coconut Palm Sugar and the first Fair Trade 
      Certified Organic Agave Nectars.
    

      Arlon led the buyout of Wholesome Sweeteners alongside Billington, 
      Wholesome Sweeteners’ management and several other investors. Arlon 
      acquired part of Billington’s ownership interest and all of the shares 
      owned by Imperial. Billington’s continued involvement, along with the 
      retention and increased ownership stake of Wholesome’s management, 
      guarantees continuity of the company’s consumer focused philosophy and 
      entrepreneurial culture.
    

      “This is an exciting time for Wholesome. Arlon’s focus on innovative 
      food businesses makes them perfect partners for the next stage of our 
      growth and development,” said Nigel Willerton, CEO of Wholesome 
      Sweeteners.
    

      “We see tremendous opportunities for continued growth at Wholesome 
      Sweeteners, and we look forward to working with the company to realize 
      this potential,” said Michelle Brooks, Managing Principal of Arlon 
      Group. “Nigel and his team have built a remarkable company that has 
      reached a position of market leadership by delivering the highest 
      quality products and meeting the growing consumer demand for socially 
      responsible and environmentally sustainable farming practices.”
    

      Wholesome Sweeteners is the fourth investment for Arlon Food and 
      Agriculture Partners LP, which provides long-term growth capital to 
      middle-market companies across the food and agriculture value chain. The 
      fund held its final closing in March 2012.

Unique Approach
Partnership and Collaboration









Unique Approach
The Power of Partnership
Arlon believes that good partnerships are fundamental to operating and financial success. We actively support the management teams of our portfolio companies to improve operations, professionalize processes and reporting, and promote additional company growth over time. As specialists in food and agriculture, we are uniquely positioned to understand the various challenges and opportunities food and agriculture businesses face. By tapping into our extensive global networks, Arlon is able to bring together the talent and industry-specific resources necessary to create value for our portfolio company partners.
Industry Access and In-depth Research Process
Arlon's in-depth research approach and extensive industry contacts allow us to capitalize on opportunities across all segments of the food supply chain, including those that may benefit from broader food and agricultural macro trends.
When considering a potential investment, our teams evaluate whether: 

Appropriate rates of return can be achieved;
Sufficient barriers to entry are in place;
Attractive exit opportunities exist; and
Arlon can deliver differentiated value

Our teams conduct deep-dive research into numerous food and agriculture sub-sectors, which allows us to take advantage of particular trends and identify the best operators in the industry. This approach also enables us to provide diversification in our private equity portfolios while mitigating risk.

Collaboration and Insight
We seek to leverage our extensive expertise to provide strategic and operational assistance to our portfolio companies. Our knowledge of the food and agriculture sectors allows us to partner with management teams to provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain and how it affects their businesses. We take a long-term approach to our relationships with the management teams of our portfolio companies and seek to create value by growing core operations while pursuing the strategic development of our portfolio companies.
Our investments are founded on partnerships with exceptional management teams who believe in working together to create value for all of the company's stakeholders. The investment teams work with management to establish a shared vision for each portfolio company's strategic development. Whether the need is to augment a growing management team, to add productive capacity to a manufacturing business, or to energize a branded business through new product development, we work closely with management to bring the right resources for each company's needs.

About Us
Global Vision for Long-Term Growth
Arlon Group is a food and agriculture investment firm with a global network that supports investments across the entire food supply chain in the Americas. Arlon focuses on identifying private equity opportunities in  middle-market food and agriculture businesses in North America and Latin America. Arlon was established and seeded in 2007 by Continental Grain Company, a more than 200-year-old, family-owned global agribusiness company with a heritage that informs all that we do.
Our Arlon investment professionals are experts in food and agriculture investing. Our investment teams work collaboratively across geographies to share insights, intelligence and expertise that help identify compelling, high-growth and long-term investment opportunities. Arlon's global network of affiliates includes Continental Grain Company and its investment group along with our affiliate in Asia, Continental Capital Limited, which invests in private food and agriculture companies, with a focus on China. Arlon has also developed a network of operating partners worldwide who provide valuable industry and operational expertise.
Far-Reaching Global Presence
Arlon has approximately *$1.5 billion in assets under management and is headquartered in New York, with an office in São Paulo, Brazil, and, through a local affiliate, in Beijing and Hong Kong, China. In addition, we have been a registered investment adviser with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since March 2012.
Compelling Investment Opportunities
Arlon believes the food and agriculture sectors offer compelling investment opportunities along the entire food supply chain - from production to distribution and consumption. These opportunities result from tight supply and demand conditions created by three primary global macro factors that we expect to endure over the long term:

Continued global population growthThe United Nations forecasts that the world's population will grow to 9.6 billion by 2050 from 7.2 billion today
Transition from a carbohydrate-based diet to a protein-based diet resulting from continued income growthWe expect that more food will have to be produced over the coming decades than has been produced during the past 10,000 years, and 
Limited arable land and waterAccording to The World Bank, in 2011 (the most recent data available), 37.5% of the world's total land was agricultural. Most of the world's high quality land is currently under production, and the amount of agricultural land (land that is arable or under permanent crops or pastures) has remained nearly static for the past 30 years. As a result, land expansion opportunities are limited, and yield growth will need to fill the majority of the production increase.

With our unique combination of targeted investment expertise and a deep-rooted foundation in the industry, we believe Arlon is ideally positioned to be a valuable partner to companies in the food and agriculture space.
*Assets under management figure is not the same as Regulatory Assets Under Management as it appears on Form ADV and which show the gross asset value plus uncalled capital.

The Expertise to Invest for the Future
Businesses in the food and agriculture sector are often as influenced by global trends as they are by local issues.

This comprehensive, deep-dive research process is central to identifying investment opportunities and "best-in-class" operators.  
Deep Food and Agriculture Sector Expertise 
We have a deep understanding across the full food and agriculture spectrum both through our own research and our networks.

North America
A Long-Term Leader in Innovation and Production
Arlon focuses its North American investment activities on small to middle-market growth investments or buyouts in the United States, the largest food and agriculture market in the world. We see North America as a key market for food and agriculture investing because of the region's prominent role in global food production and consumption and its long history of innovation. 
The U.S. serves as both an important global agricultural producer, with leadership positions in many global commodity export markets, and as a leading market for consumer-focused product development. U.S. research and innovation in food and agriculture has led to best-in-class practices and products that benefit the global industry across a variety of areas. On the agricultural end of the supply chain, North America's high agricultural yields have been built on decades of advancements in farm management, crop science and research into optimizing inputs. The U.S. is also well known as the originator of many global food product trends, with a significant number of new food items introduced to the market each year, both at retail and in foodservice outlets.  
Sample Investment Criteria
Arlon has the flexibility to consider investments outside the parameters below, and Arlon's investments may not meet the criteria as described herein.

North America


EBITDA greater than $5mm
Cash flow positive
Equity check: typically $25-50mm, although, for the right opportunity, we will invest more or less
