Our platform is based upon a breakthrough understanding of somatic hypermutation, the key biological process utilized to generate antibodies, which enables us to rapidly develop highly functional antibody drug candidates against emerging biological targets.Our wholly-owned product pipeline includes ANB020 and ANB019, which are being developed to treat severe inflammatory disorders with unmet medical need. We are advancing our ANB020 product candidate, an antibody that inhibits the activity of interleukin-33, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, severe adult peanut allergy and severe adult eosinophilic asthma. In addition, we are developing our ANB019 product candidate, an antibody that inhibits the interleukin-36 receptor, for the treatment of rare inflammatory diseases called generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPP).Our company is led by a strong management team with a proven track record of successfully growing biotechnology companies with deep experience in antibody discovery and development, collaborations, operations and corporate finance.Additionally, we have entered into multiple collaborations from which we expect multiple programs will enter the clinic. Our collaborations include an immuno-oncology-focused collaboration with TESARO and an inflammation-focused collaboration with Celgene.   Strategy - AnaptysBio ContactCareers  Search for:     OverviewStrategyManagementBoard of DirectorsTherapeutic Advisory Board  StrategyAdvancing our lead wholly-owned programs for the treatment of severe inflammatory diseaseWe plan to develop our proprietary anti-IL-33 antibody (ANB020) for the treatment of severe adult asthma and severe adult peanut allergy. In addition, we intend to develop our anti-IL-36R antibody (ANB019) for the treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis (PPP).Identifying emerging target biology opportunities in inflammation and immuno-oncologyWe intend to remain at the forefront of discovery and development of new therapeutic opportunities in inflammation and immuno-oncology by understanding and translating biological breakthroughs into first-in-class therapeutic antibodies. Our approach includes assessment of human genetics and tissue pathology to understand the relevance of emerging targets to patients with unmet medical needs. We plan to leverage this knowledge to create new product candidates and position our current and future programs for rapid clinical proof-of-concept achievement.Expanding our proprietary pipeline by generating new antibody product candidates using our technology platformUsing our proprietary antibody generation platform, we are able to rapidly develop novel therapeutic antibodies against emerging targets. Our goal is to advance multiple additional wholly-owned new therapeutic antibody program to IND submission.Retaining rights to strategic products in key commercial marketsWe intend to retain ownership and control of our pipeline programs to key inflection points.

AnaptysBio Announces Strategic Collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc.

SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, February 8, 2010 – AnaptysBio, Inc., a privately-held therapeutic antibody platform and product company, today announced a strategic collaboration with Merck, through an affiliate, to develop novel antibody therapeutics to an undisclosed disease target.
Under the terms of the agreement, AnaptysBio will be responsible for generating novel antibodies to a specified disease target using its proprietary somatic hypermutation (SHM) technology platform. Merck will receive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize antibodies optimized by AnaptysBio. AnaptysBio has received an upfront sum and is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties associated with the development and sale of any products derived from the collaboration.


“Our SHM-Platform™ generates antibodies in a human-like manner that recapitulates in the laboratory what the body naturally does when creating antibodies to fight disease. And this is achieved without the constraints and limitations often imposed by the body which can limit success,” said Tom Smart, chairman and chief executive officer for AnaptysBio. “The platform provides a powerful new approach for the generation of antibodies to meet challenging therapeutic design goals.”


About AnaptysBio
Founded in 2005, AnaptysBio, Inc is a privately-held therapeutic antibody product company and the leader in the use of somatic hypermutation, or SHM, for antibody discovery and optimization. SHM is the body's natural process for generating potent antibodies to fight disease. The Company's SHM-Platform™ utilizes the key components of SHM and other state-of-the-art techniques such as mammalian cell expression/display and flow cytometry to generate antibodies for therapeutic applications through an iterative process of natural evolution and high-throughput selection – a process that has been referred to as "naturalizing" antibodies. This versatile platform can be used both to discover and optimize antibodies directed at specific disease targets and also affinity mature existing antibodies to improve their binding properties. The company has established broad intellectual property around the use of SHM for therapeutic antibody applications, and is currently building a pipeline of novel therapeutic antibody product candidates. For more information, visit www.anaptysbio.com.
