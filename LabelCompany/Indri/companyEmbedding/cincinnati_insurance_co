 0Private Carriers0States Of Operation0Happy ClientsWhy Choose UsWe Are Different
Most agencies only offer earthquake insurance through state disaster funds such as the California Earthquake Authority (CEA).  Unfortunately, coverage is extremely limited and expensive compared to standard home insurance. Luckily, we have contracted with several carriers that specialize in offering affordable earthquake insurance. Earthquake is a specialized policy, let us shop your policy so that you know all of the best available options.
Our Goal
Is to provide great coverage options while saving you money. We work with 7 earthquake insurance carriers who are separate from the state run funds. Because they have the ability to select the properties that they wish to insure, rates can be MUCH LOWER than what you currently pay. It’s easy to request a quote, and of course there is no obligation to buy.
Our Customers Come First
Everything that we do is for our customers,  and we’re proud to show this as we work with you to find Affordable Earthquake Insurance. It is our goal to save you money and provide you with excellent service.

What Our Customers Say


I submitted my quote request online, received an email confirmation 1 minute later, and a phone call from my agent 5 minutes after that. He let me know that he would submit my quote and that I would hear back shortly. I received my quote later that day and was able to digitally sign my application. They saved me tons of money and made it so easy! – Lonie Kemblo




My policy through the CEA seemed so limited. The folks at Stone Creek Insurance really helped me out by finding a policy that offers all of the coverage that I need while saving me hundreds. – Emerald Walker

    Nplate® FIRST STEP™ Co-Pay Coupon Card Program—Nplate® (romiplostim)

































Indication 

        Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when
        certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.  Read More

Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any
            condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical
            condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the
            risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in
            people under the age of 18.  Close

Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

How Nplate® Works: Video Transcript
Indication
Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.
Not all patients will respond to Nplate®. Individual patient results may vary.
Hello! This video is designed to help you understand:

How platelets are naturally made in the body.
How immune thrombocytopenia (or ITP) causes low platelet counts.
How Nplate® works to help increase the number of platelets in adults with chronic ITP.
Nplate® Important Safety Information.

At any given time, trillions of blood cells are circulating in your body.
There are different types of cells in your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
ITP is a condition that specifically affects your platelets. Let's take a look inside the body to learn more about platelets.
Platelets are small cells that are needed to help your blood form clots.
They are made by special cells in your bones, in the spongy core called bone marrow. Platelets are normally destroyed after 9 or 10 days and replaced with new platelets.
A protein called thrombopoietin, or TPO, controls how many platelets are made.
In the bone marrow, TPO attaches to the cells that make platelets. This triggers the cells to make platelets and release them into the blood. If the level of TPO in the blood is low, fewer platelets are made. If the level of TPO in the blood is high, more platelets are made.
Normally when there are adequate or high numbers of platelets in circulation, TPO levels are low. However, when platelet levels drop, TPO levels increase to help make more platelets.
Now let's discuss what happens to platelets in adults with chronic ITP.
In adults with chronic ITP, platelets are destroyed by antibodies.
In ITP, antibodies cause the destruction of TPO, the protein needed for platelet production. Since TPO naturally binds to platelets, it is destroyed along with the platelets.
Because TPO levels are low, there is not a strong enough signal for normal platelet production, and therefore, not enough platelets are being produced.
This means ITP involves both increased platelet destruction and lower-than-expected platelet production, which results in low platelet counts.
People with ITP who have lower-than-normal platelet counts have a condition called thrombocytopenia, which can cause bleeding, bruising, and other symptoms.
Now that we've discussed how platelets are formed, and what happens in adults with chronic ITP, let's discuss how Nplate® works to help increase platelet counts in adults with chronic ITP.
Nplate® is a type of medicine called a platelet booster.
Like TPO, Nplate® attaches to special cells in the bone marrow, triggering platelet production.
Nplate® increases platelet production at a rate that outpaces platelet destruction, which helps increase platelet counts in adults with chronic ITP.
It's important to know that not all patients will respond to Nplate®, and individual patient results may vary.
It's important to understand that Nplate® does not bring platelet counts to normal levels, but it can help raise them to a level high enough to help reduce symptoms of ITP.

Important Safety Information
                What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?
            
Nplate® can cause serious side effects:


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
                    Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
                
Higher risk for blood clots:

You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.


Loss of response:
                    If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
                

Blood test monitoring:
                    Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
                


What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?

Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
The most common side effects of Nplate®are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain

How Nplate® works
Platelets are made by cells in the bone marrow. A protein in your body called thrombopoietin (TPO) tells these cells to produce platelets. Nplate® works like TPO, helping bone marrow cells to produce more platelets, which may help reduce the risk of bleeding.1,3

Nplate® works with the body to make more platelets




The body needs a protein called thrombopoietin (TPO) to help cells in the bone marrow to make more platelets. Adult patients with ITP have less TPO than they need.4-7





Nplate® works like the body’s own TPO, helping bone marrow cells to make more platelets.1,8





With Nplate®, cells in the bone marrow make more platelets that may help stay ahead of the platelet destruction.1

Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.

Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

Starting Nplate®
How should I take Nplate®?1

Before you receive Nplate® you should first talk with your healthcare provider and understand the benefits and risks of Nplate®.
Nplate® is given as a subcutaneous (SC) injection under the skin one time each week. You may not give Nplate® injections to yourself.
Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Tell your healthcare provider about any bruising or bleeding that occurs while you are receiving Nplate®.
If you miss a scheduled dose of Nplate®, call your healthcare provider to arrange for your next dose as soon as possible.






Getting to your right dose1

The initial recommended dose for Nplate® is based on your actual body weight.
Your doctor will adjust your weekly dose until you reach a platelet count range that reduces the risk of bleeding.
Don't get discouraged if you don’t reach your treatment goal right away. It takes some patients several weeks and may require dose adjustments* until a stable platelet count is reached.
Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Work with your doctor and stay with your treatment plan.

*In clinical trials, the average number of dose changes until patients reached a platelet count high enough to reduce the risk for bleeding was 3. Not all patients were able to reach a platelet count above 50,000 per microliter.1,2

Checking your platelet count regularly1

Your doctor will check your platelet count every week at first.
Your doctor will change your Nplate® dose as needed until you achieve a platelet count high enough to reduce the risk for bleeding for 4 weeks in a row. After that, blood tests will be taken every month.
If you stop taking Nplate®, blood tests are needed for at least 2 weeks after. This is to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Tell your healthcare provider about any bruising or bleeding that occurs while you are receiving Nplate®.

Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.


Please see Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for more information about Nplate® on Nplate.com.



Indication
Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.

CINCINNATI INSURANCE CO v. VITA FOOD PRODUCTS INC

CINCINNATI INSURANCE CO v. VITA FOOD PRODUCTS INC

United States Court of Appeals,Seventh Circuit.
CINCINNATI INSURANCE CO., Plaintiff–Appellee, v. VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC., Defendant–Appellant.
No. 15–1405.
    Decided: December 16, 2015

		Before BAUER, POSNER, and KANNE, Circuit Judges.Brian M. Reid, Daniel Patrick Johnston, Attorney, Litchfield Cavo LLP, Chicago, IL, for Plaintiff–Appellee. Steven Paul Blonder, I, Attorney, Much Shelist, P.C., Chicago, IL, for Defendant–Appellant.
The Cincinnati Insurance Company issued a liability insurance policy to a company called Painters USA for a one-year period beginning on January 15, 2011. It has brought this suit to try to avoid having to provide coverage to another company, Vita Food Products, which claims to be an “additional insured”—that is, to also be covered by the liability insurance policy that Cincinnati had issued to Painters.The policy covered “bodily injury” caused by an “occurrence” (an accident, presumably) for which the insured was legally liable to the injured person. But in addition the policy allowed the insured to add an “additional insured” to the policy by an oral agreement (or a written one, but this case involves an oral agreement), provided that the oral agreement preceded the “occurrence” and that “a certificate of insurance showing that person or organization as an additional insured has been issued.” No permission from Cincinnati Insurance is required for the primary insured to create an additional insured, provided that the two insureds have a relationship that makes the addition of a second insured consistent with the nature and aims of the policy, as when the original insured is providing products or services to the additional insured (as occurred in this case).While Cincinnati's insurance policy was in force, Painters was hired by Vita Food Products to do painting on Vita's premises. According to Vita, Painters agreed to add Vita as an additional insured—orally. Vita doubtless was concerned that if one of Painters' workers was injured on Vita's premises, the worker would file a tort suit against Vita—he couldn't sue Painters because an employee normally has only a workers' compensation remedy against his employer and not a common law tort remedy.In fact, one of Painters' workers, Nardo Ovando, did sue Vita, for negligent maintenance of its premises. It was soon after Painters began doing work for Vita and before there was any written confirmation of the oral agreement that Ovando fell while working at Vita. He sustained a terrible injury, and remains in a coma to this day. A tort suit was filed against Vita on Ovando's behalf and that of his wife (Karina Baez, who claims loss of consortium). The suit before us, however, is a diversity suit brought by the insurance company to obtain a declaration that Vita was not covered by the policy that the company had issued to Painters. The company points out that the accident, even if it occurred after the oral agreement that added Vita as a party insured, occurred before the preparation of the certificate confirming Vita's status as an additional insured. Ovando and Baez are named as additional defendants, since as plaintiffs in the state court tort suit against Vita they might claim an entitlement to share in any insurance proceeds that Vita receives in order to help it pay damages to the plaintiffs, should Vita be held liable for Ovando's accident.Painters had requested the certificate within hours after Ovando's injury, and an insurance agent for Cincinnati Insurance had issued it to Vita the next day. But the district judge agreed with Cincinnati that the certificate had come too late—that until it was prepared and signed the “additional insured” was not actually insured. And so the judge granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance company, precipitating this appeal by Vita. The insurance company also denied, and continues to deny, that the oral agreement adding Vita as an insured preceded the accident. But there was conflicting evidence on that point, and the district judge therefore correctly ruled that the issue could not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment.But his grant of summary judgment in favor of Cincinnati Insurance was premature. The reference in the insurance policy to a certificate of insurance is ambiguous. It could, as Cincinnati argues, be regarded as a prerequisite to coverage of the additional insured, but equally it could be regarded as intended merely to memorialize the oral agreement, in which event the date of the certificate would not matter. A third possibility—which like the second supports Vita's position—is that the oral agreement must be memorialized in writing before the insured can file a claim.The district judge invoked “the requirement that coverage is extended only ‘where a certificate has been issued.’ “ But that's not what the policy says. The oral agreement has to precede the accident that gives rise to the insured's claim, but there is no indication of when the certificate of insurance has to be issued. We have just suggested that a permissible interpretation would be that it must be issued before the additional insured files a claim with the insurance company, as it was in this case.An ambiguous insurance contract is interpreted “against the drafter of the policy and in favor of coverage,” Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 607 N.E.2d 1204, 1217–20 (Ill.1992), in recognition that such contracts are drafted by, and therefore likely to be slanted in favor of, the insurer and that the insured rarely has any bargaining power because such contracts are usually industry-wide standard-form contracts, the terms of which therefore are not negotiated anew every time a person or firm seeks insurance coverage. The commercial general liability policy issued by Cincinnati Insurance to Painters is such a contract, for it is offered to potential insureds on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Since the reference in the policy to the certificate of insurance is ambiguous, the judge erred in holding that the policy's “clear and unambiguous” language proves that Vita was not an additional insured. The pertinent language was neither clear nor unambiguous. The certificate may be useful in heading off a dispute over whether there really is an oral agreement. But the fulfillment of that purpose would require only that the certificate precede the additional insured's claim for the proceeds of the insurance policy, and the certificate in this case did precede the claim.Cincinnati Insurance argues that requiring the certificate before a liability-triggering event occurs is necessary to protect the insurer against fakery by the insured. After Ovando's accident Painters would have been desperate for Vita to be acknowledged as an additional insured, as otherwise Vita, facing suit by Ovando and his wife, might try to drag Painters into the suit, accusing it of responsibility for the accident. The certificate was not issued by Painters or Vita, however, but instead, as we noted earlier, by an insurance agent on behalf of Cincinnati Insurance. The agent would not be willing to backdate a certificate of insurance at the insured's (Painters') request, so requiring that the certificate precede the accident would provide extra protection against fakery. Oral agreements are valid contracts, however, and the insurance policy is explicit that an oral agreement is sufficient to add an additional insured.The certificate of insurance, in contrast, is not a contract. It states that it “is issued as a matter of information only,” “confers no rights upon the certificate holder,” “does not affirmatively or negatively amend, extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies,” and “does not constitute a contract between the issuing insurer(s), authorized representative or producer, and the certificate holder.” Cincinnati Insurance calls it a precondition to insuring Vita against liability for the accident to Ovando. Were it a precondition it would indeed amend the coverage provided by the policy that Cincinnati Insurance issued to Painters. But the language of the certificate indicates that it isn't a precondition to anything; it's just information.The insurance company cites a similar case that it won, Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Gateway Construction Co., 865 N.E.2d 395 (Ill.App.2007), but overlooks a crucial difference: in Gateway the policy did not permit an oral agreement to add an additional insured. See id. at 399. Our interpretation of the additional-insured provision in the present case is supported by such cases as ATOFINA Petrochemicals, Inc. v. Continental Casualty Co., 185 S.W.3d 440, 443–44 (Tex.2005), and United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Shorenstein Realty Services, LP, 591 F.Supp.2d 966, 968–70 (N.D.Ill.2008) (Illinois law).So if Vita can prove that there was an oral agreement to add it as an additional insured prior to the accident to Ovando, it will be entitled to coverage under Cincinnati Insurance's policy. The judgment of the district court in favor of the insurance company is therefore REVERSED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.POSNER, Circuit Judge.

When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

Most agencies only offer earthquake insurance through state disaster funds such as the California Earthquake Authority (CEA).  Unfortunately, coverage is extremely limited and expensive compared to standard home insurance. Luckily, we have contracted with several carriers that specialize in offering affordable earthquake insurance. Earthquake is a specialized policy, let us shop your policy so that you know all of the best available options.
Our Goal
Is to provide great coverage options while saving you money. We work with 7 earthquake insurance carriers who are separate from the state run funds. Because they have the ability to select the properties that they wish to insure, rates can be MUCH LOWER than what you currently pay. It’s easy to request a quote, and of course there is no obligation to buy.
Our Customers Come First

They saved me tons of money and made it so easy! – Lonie Kemblo

    Nplate® FIRST STEP™ Co-Pay Coupon Card Program—Nplate® (romiplostim)

































Indication 

        Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when
        certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.  Read More

Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any
            condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical
            condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the
            risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in
            people under the age of 18.  Close

Important Safety Information








Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"

How Nplate® Works: Video Transcript
Indication
Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.
Not all patients will respond to Nplate®. Individual patient results may vary.
Hello! This video is designed to help you understand:

How platelets are naturally made in the body.
How immune thrombocytopenia (or ITP) causes low platelet counts.
How Nplate® works to help increase the number of platelets in adults with chronic ITP.
Nplate® Important Safety Information.

At any given time, trillions of blood cells are circulating in your body.
There are different types of cells in your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
ITP is a condition that specifically affects your platelets. Let's take a look inside the body to learn more about platelets.
Platelets are small cells that are needed to help your blood form clots.
They are made by special cells in your bones, in the spongy core called bone marrow. Platelets are normally destroyed after 9 or 10 days and replaced with new platelets.
A protein called thrombopoietin, or TPO, controls how many platelets are made.
In the bone marrow, TPO attaches to the cells that make platelets. This triggers the cells to make platelets and release them into the blood. If the level of TPO in the blood is low, fewer platelets are made. If the level of TPO in the blood is high, more platelets are made.
Normally when there are adequate or high numbers of platelets in circulation, TPO levels are low. However, when platelet levels drop, TPO levels increase to help make more platelets.
Now let's discuss what happens to platelets in adults with chronic ITP.
In adults with chronic ITP, platelets are destroyed by antibodies.
In ITP, antibodies cause the destruction of TPO, the protein needed for platelet production. Since TPO naturally binds to platelets, it is destroyed along with the platelets.
Because TPO levels are low, there is not a strong enough signal for normal platelet production, and therefore, not enough platelets are being produced.
This means ITP involves both increased platelet destruction and lower-than-expected platelet production, which results in low platelet counts.
People with ITP who have lower-than-normal platelet counts have a condition called thrombocytopenia, which can cause bleeding, bruising, and other symptoms.
Now that we've discussed how platelets are formed, and what happens in adults with chronic ITP, let's discuss how Nplate® works to help increase platelet counts in adults with chronic ITP.
Nplate® is a type of medicine called a platelet booster.
Like TPO, Nplate® attaches to special cells in the bone marrow, triggering platelet production.
Nplate® increases platelet production at a rate that outpaces platelet destruction, which helps increase platelet counts in adults with chronic ITP.
It's important to know that not all patients will respond to Nplate®, and individual patient results may vary.
It's important to understand that Nplate® does not bring platelet counts to normal levels, but it can help raise them to a level high enough to help reduce symptoms of ITP.

Important Safety Information
                What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?
            
Nplate® can cause serious side effects:


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
                    Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
                
Higher risk for blood clots:

You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.


Loss of response:
                    If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
                

Blood test monitoring:
                    Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
                


What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?

Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
The most common side effects of Nplate®are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch
, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

How Nplate® works
Platelets are made by cells in the bone marrow. A protein in your body called thrombopoietin (TPO) tells these cells to produce platelets. Nplate® works like TPO, helping bone marrow cells to produce more platelets, which may help reduce the risk of bleeding.1,3

Nplate® works with the body to make more platelets




The body needs a protein called thrombopoietin (TPO) to help cells in the bone marrow to make more platelets. Adult patients with ITP have less TPO than they need.4-7





Nplate® works like the body’s own TPO, helping bone marrow cells to make more platelets.1,8





With Nplate®, cells in the bone marrow make more platelets that may help stay ahead of the platelet destruction.1

    Patient Resources - ITP News and Patient Support - Nplate® (romiplostim)


































Indication 

        Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when
        certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.  Read More

Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any
            condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical
            condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the
            risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in
            people under the age of 18.  Close

Important Safety Information








Important Safety Information 
            
            What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®? 
            
            Nplate® can cause serious side effects:
        


Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer (leukemia):
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or for any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). If you have MDS and receive Nplate®, your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia. If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia.
            

Higher risk for blood clots:


You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

Starting Nplate®
How should I take Nplate®?1

Before you receive Nplate® you should first talk with your healthcare provider and understand the benefits and risks of Nplate®.
Nplate® is given as a subcutaneous (SC) injection under the skin one time each week. You may not give Nplate® injections to yourself.
Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Tell your healthcare provider about any bruising or bleeding that occurs while you are receiving Nplate®.
If you miss a scheduled dose of Nplate®, call your healthcare provider to arrange for your next dose as soon as possible.






Getting to your right dose1

The initial recommended dose for Nplate® is based on your actual body weight.
Your doctor will adjust your weekly dose until you reach a platelet count range that reduces the risk of bleeding.
Don't get discouraged if you don’t reach your treatment goal right away. It takes some patients several weeks and may require dose adjustments* until a stable platelet count is reached.
Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Work with your doctor and stay with your treatment plan.

*In clinical trials, the average number of dose changes until patients reached a platelet count high enough to reduce the risk for bleeding was 3. Not all patients were able to reach a platelet count above 50,000 per microliter.1,2

Checking your platelet count regularly1

Your doctor will check your platelet count every week at first.
Your doctor will change your Nplate® dose as needed until you achieve a platelet count high enough to reduce the risk for bleeding for 4 weeks in a row. After that, blood tests will be taken every month.
If you stop taking Nplate®, blood tests are needed for at least 2 weeks after. This is to check if your platelet count drops too low.
Tell your healthcare provider about any bruising or bleeding that occurs while you are receiving Nplate®.
If you miss a scheduled dose of Nplate, call your healthcare provider to arrange for your next dose as soon as possible.

You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate®. You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots, such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes. Your healthcare provider will check your blood platelet counts and change your dose or stop Nplate® if your platelet counts get high.
If you have a chronic liver disease, you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver. This may affect your liver function.

Loss of response: If you do not experience results from Nplate®, your immune system may have created a response that is counteractive to Nplate®. Your healthcare provider will monitor your platelet counts and test your blood regularly to determine if this is an issue.
Blood test monitoring: Your healthcare provider will check your platelet count every week and change your dose of Nplate® as needed. This will continue until your healthcare provider decides that your dose of Nplate® can stay the same. After that, you will need to have blood tests every month. When you stop receiving Nplate®, you will need blood tests for at least 2 weeks to check if your platelet count drops too low.

What are the possible side effects of Nplate®?



                    Nplate® may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about Nplate®?"
                
The most common side effects of Nplate® are:

Headache
Joint pain
Dizziness
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tenderness or weakness
Pain in arms and legs
Abdominal pain
Shoulder pain
Indigestion
Tingling or numbness in hands and feet

People who take Nplate® may have an increased risk of developing new or worsening changes in the bone marrow called “increased reticulin”. These changes may improve if you stop taking Nplate®. Your healthcare provider may need to check your bone marrow for this problem during treatment with Nplate®.
These are not all the possible side effects of Nplate®. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this information, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.


Please see Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for more information about Nplate® on Nplate.com.



Indication
Nplate® is a man-made protein medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove your spleen, have not worked well enough.
Nplate® is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low platelet count caused by any condition other than chronic (lasting a long time) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Nplate® is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding. Nplate® is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50,000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding. Nplate® is not used to make your platelet count normal. It is not known if Nplate® works or if it is safe in people under the age of 18.

Mobile Home Insurance


If you live in a mobile home, you have access to insurance coverage that will protect your property. Mobile home insurance quotes are as accessible as other types of home insurance, making it easy to protect your home and your assets. Even though the coverage is slightly different due to the type of dwelling, mobile home insurance offers many options that allow you to find an affordable solution to your coverage needs. In spite of the fact that mobile homes are much less expensive than traditional homes, they are still valuable assets that must be protected from loss. Finding the right coverage will keep your family financially secure even if disaster strikes and your property is damaged or destroyed.
If you own a mobile home, be aware that there is a specific type of home insurance to protect your valuable asset. Mobile homes are different from ordinary houses because they are built in factories. They are delivered upon purchase and can be uprooted and transferred to a different location later.
Mobile Home Insurance Coverage
Mobile home insurance helps protect your mobile home from many forms of loss. This can apply to a great variety of damages resulting from fire, storms, accidents and more. Just like other types of insurance policies, the fine print dictates how broad the coverage is.
Many mobile home insurance policies also cover adjacent structures which are not necessarily connected to your mobile home. These can include the patio, garden, or garage. However, several policies do not include coverage to the mobile home while it is being transferred from one location to another.
Coverage for Your Personal Assets
Mobile home insurance not only helps to protect your actual dwelling but also your personal property. It protects your personal property from theft and other criminal activities. Personal property coverage is included in a typical policy but the limits and coverage vary widely between different insurance plans so be sure to comparison shop.
Coverage for Yourself and Your Family
Mobile home insurance also protects individuals from a host of personal liabilities. This helps provide protection in case you cause somebody else bodily harm or damage their property. It usually covers guests to your home as well as individuals far from your property. Typically, the personal liability should not be automobile-related to be included in the coverage.
Mobile Home Insurance – More Reasons to Get Them
This comprehensive insurance plan helps cover you from a broad range of risks. It provides coverage for your home, your possessions, and even personal liabilities. Individuals can opt to extend their mobile home insurance plans with add-ons too.
Other popular extensions at additional costs include collision insurance and extended coverage on certain possessions typically not included in the coverage. Collision insurance covers your mobile home when it is being moved to another location.
Choosing the Best Mobile Home Insurance Coverage
When searching for mobile home insurance companies, you’ll find many coverage options at various rates. Created to cover many types of loss, mobile home insurance quotes can be from many providers and cover many types of property. Typically, this type of coverage will compensate you for losses caused by fire, storms, theft, accidents, and other forms of loss. It’s important to understand the policy in order to assess exactly what is covered before you decide on a specific provider. Often, the coverage extends to connecting property like porches, patios, storage sheds, and garages. You may also be able to include coverage for adjacent structures, even if they are not attached to the mobile home. Depending on your structure and your specific needs, you may be able to find coverage that meets your specific needs with ease.
When reviewing mobile home insurance quotes, the policies will also cover personal property contained in the home. Furnishings, appliances, and other personal belongings may also be covered in most policies. You may also be able to add items like collectibles, art work, and jewelry depending on the provider. When you’re making the decision on which insurance quote to choose, it’s important to read the fine print in order to find the right coverage for your home.
Mobile Home Renters Insurance
Like home insurance, mobile home insurance is designed to provide coverage for renters and homeowners. You can search for mobile home renters insurance quotes in order to protect your property as a renter. Searching for quotes online presents you with endless options and customizable features to ensure you find the coverage that is ideal for your situation. USInsuranceOnline.com makes it simple. With access to multiple quotes from the leading providers in your area, it’s easy to select the best policy for your mobile home.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
