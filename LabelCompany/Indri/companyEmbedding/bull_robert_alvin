The logo shows the American Car and Foundry (ACF) surrounded by an Indian teepee, a log cabin and the profiles of a Susquehannock Indian and a pioneer settler. Along with designing the Society's logo, Russel also painted two murals in The First Baptist Church on Front Street in Berwick and designed and copyrighted in 1936 a Romance Map commemorating the Berwick Sesquicentennial (1786-1936). He also did a mural of the Liberty Bell which still hangs in the Hotel Bethlehem, Bethlehem, PA. Russel was the second eldest of nine children born to Harry and Nellie Fahringer on August 4, 1908 in Berwick, PA. The following is Russel Fahringer's obituary published Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2001 in the St. Augustine Record, St. Augustine, Florida:russellRussel Fahringer, a 26 year resident of St. Augustine, 92, a commercial artist and World War II veteran died February 17, 2001, after a life well-lived. He studied as a commercial artist at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art in the 1920s, and he traveled the Midwest throughout the 1930s painting murals and illustrating historical maps. He was a combat engineer in World War II in the European theater where he moved with Allied Forces from North Africa into Italy and into Europe, leading a unit tasked to clear the beaches of obstacles the morning of the D-Day invasion. Russel worked for studios in New York City after the war and studied at the New York Art Students League, painting and illustrating for magazines and galleries. He worked later as the director of an art department for a U.S. Government facility and retired to St. Augustine in 1975, where he was a member of the St. Augustine Art Association for 25 years. He said the measure of a man's life was that he left the world a better place than when he entered it; his life measured up well.
