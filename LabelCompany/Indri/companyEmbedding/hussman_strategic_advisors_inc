This Week: 
Wrecking Ball
                 
           What’s often missed in the “low interest rates justify  higher valuations” argument is that this proposition assumes that future cash  flows and growth rates are held  constant. By responding to low interest rates by elevating P/E multiples, without accounting for depressed long-term nominal economic growth prospects, and to base those P/E multiples on earnings that embed elevated profit margins  (driven by a shortfall between wage growth and productivity that has already begun  to reverse as the unemployment rate pushes 4.4%) is to drive prospective  returns down three times; a mistaken form  of triple-counting that is precisely why  expected 10-12 year market returns are presently so weak. The pendulum of speculation has swung far and has grown increasingly  grotesque in order to reach this point. It will be a wrecking ball when it  returns to earth.

When Market Trends Break, 
Even Borderline Data is Recessionary
When stock market action  deteriorates and broad economic data is weakening even moderately, the risks of  a recession actually jump considerably. The conditional probability of a  recession prior to the market falling below its 12-month moving average was  just 5-10 percent. It has now jumped to between 60 and 75 percent. This is roughly  6 or 7 times the odds that economists are allowing for a recession.

Mutual Fund Brokerage Fees and Trading Costs 
How much do mutual funds pay in commissions and trading costs? This is a question that the mutual fund industry seems reluctant to answer. In an industry already complicated by fees - sales loads, soft dollars, trailing fees, 12b-1 marketing fees - asking mutual funds to prominently disclose trading costs is unpopular among fund companies. We've decided to take the lead anyway. It's the right thing to do.

Broken Links: Fed Policy and the Growing Gap Between Wall Street and Main Street 

John P. Hussman, Ph.D.
      All rights reserved and actively enforced.
Reprint Policy
When the majority of Americans examine the world around  them, they see a stock market at record highs and modest apparent improvement  in the economy, but they also have the sense that something remains terribly  wrong, and they can’t quite put their finger on it. According to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve, 40% of American families report that they are “just  getting by,” and 60% of families do not have sufficient savings to cover even 3  months of expenses. Even Fed Chair Janet Yellen seemed puzzled last week by the  contrast between a gradually improving unemployment rate and persistently  sluggish real wage growth. 
We would suggest that much of this perplexity reflects the  application of incorrect models of the world. 
Before the 15th century, people gazed at the sky,  and believed that other planets would move around the Earth, stop, move  backwards for a bit, and then move forward again. Their model of the world –  that the Earth was the center of the universe – was the source of this  confusion.
Similarly, one of the reasons that the economy seems so  confusing at present is that our policy makers are following  models that have very mixed evidence in reality. Worse, when extraordinary  measures don’t produce the desired results, the response is to double the  effort without carefully asking whether there is a reliable, measurable  cause-and-effect relationship in the first place. When there are broken links  in the chain of cause-and-effect, “A causes B” may be true, and “C causes D”  may be true, but if B doesn’t cause C, then all the A in the world won’t give  you D. 
Let’s review some relationships in the data that are clear,  and some that are not so clear at all. All data in the charts below are from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), and present relationships in post-war U.S. data except as otherwise noted. 
Quantitative easing  and short-term interest rates
First, the following chart shows the relationship since 1929  between the monetary base (per dollar of nominal GDP) and short-term interest  rates. This is our variant of what economists call the “liquidity preference  curve,” and is one of the strongest relationships between economic variables  you’re likely to observe in the real world. After years of quantitative easing,  the monetary base now stands at 24% of GDP. Notice that less than 16% was  already enough to ensure zero interest rates, so the past trillion and a half  dollars of QE have done little but increase the pool of zero-interest assets  that are fodder for yield-seeking speculation. Notice also that unless the Fed  begins to pay interest to banks on their idle reserves, the Fed would have to contract  its balance sheet by about $1 trillion just to raise Treasury bill yields up to a fraction of one percent. So the  primary policy tool of the Fed in the next couple of years will likely be changes  in interest on reserves (IOR). Get used to that acronym. 
[The left scale shows the 3-month Treasury bill yield, in percent. For monetary base/GDP, note that as 0.24 is 24% and so forth, the horizontal axis is presented in decimal form]. 

Interest rates, wealth effects, and economic  growth
Following this very strong economic relationship, let’s  examine a very weak one. It should give pause to those who believe that low  interest rates are naturally associated with stronger economic activity. The  fact is that when productive opportunities to invest are available, strong  economic activity and normal or even elevated interest rates are completely  compatible, and those higher interest rates also raise the bar in a way that  discourages borrowing for unproductive activities. 
When “natural” demand for loans is weak and legitimately productive  opportunities to invest are not available, there is a temptation – clearly enticing  to the Federal Reserve – to attempt to artificially stimulate demand for loans  in hopes of provoking greater economic activity. The problem with repressing  the financial system this way is that it lowers not only the bar on loan cost, but  also the bar on loan quality. This is  essentially what produced the global financial crisis. Artificially depressed  interest rates punish savers and cause them to seek yield by channeling funds  to more and more speculative areas of the economy, while encouraging already  indebted borrowers to take on more debt so long as the debt can be serviced for now. 
The chart below should suffice as a reminder that interest  rates and economic growth are both determined by a complex interplay of supply  and demand, and that low short-term interest rates in themselves have no clear  relationship to subsequent economic growth. The points on the  chart show the 3-month Treasury bill rate on the horizontal axis, with the  growth of real U.S. gross domestic product during the subsequent year on the  vertical axis. The points are connected to trace their movement over time. 

Now, there are certainly statistical tools that can be  brought to bear to “identify” supply and demand, in order to show that lower  interest rates do increase the demand for borrowed funds. It’s just that a policy of suppressing short-term interest rates in the hope of turning the world into  a big, exploitable demand curve (where supply passively accommodates every  policy change) is a fantasy born of partial-equilibrium thinking. It’s the same  line of thinking that leads developing nations to put price controls on bread,  only to discover that bread is cheap and yet nobody gets bread.
The relationship doesn’t improve if we examine it in terms  of real interest rates after  inflation. The same point can be demonstrated with as many variations as one  chooses to examine, but one chart should convey the idea. If anything (and one  can show this better using cross-country data), higher real interest rates are generally accompanied by faster, not  slower, subsequent real economic growth – largely because higher real interest rates reflect robust  demand for loans and a desirable menu of productive investments with high expected  rates of return. The points on the  chart show the 3-month Treasury bill rate, after inflation, on the horizontal  axis, with the growth of real U.S. gross domestic product during the subsequent  year on the vertical axis. The points are connected to trace their movement over time.

The most common problem with the model that people carry  around in their heads – “lower interest rates stimulate economic growth” – is  that it’s a pure demand-side argument and reduces the complexity of long-term  investment decisions to nothing more than the interest rate. For most  companies, the central decision in borrowing to invest is whether the long-term  stream of future output resulting from the investment will be sufficiently  demanded to profitably cover the cost of the investment, including but not  limited to the interest payments.
So what sort of decision does the Fed’s policy of suppressing  interest rates encourage? Only those where the cost of funds is the primary  cost of doing business: financial transactions. A few years ago, housing could  be included as a major beneficiary of Fed-induced speculation not only among  financial institutions but among ordinary investors. But that ship has sailed,  crashed into the glacier, and sunk to the bottom of the deep blue sea. So what  we now have is a financial sector amped up on more than four trillion tablets  of amphetamine, and a real economic sector that remains at year-to-year growth  rates that have historically marked the border between expansion and recession. 
Meanwhile, any historically informed and reasonably educated economist should have recognized that Bernanke's proposed "wealth effect" from stock prices to GDP was a canard from the instant that notion left his lips. Milton Friedman won a Nobel Prize in part by demonstrating that individuals consume off of what they conceive as their "permanent income," not based on fluctuations in volatile securities. Indeed, it's easy to show that a 1% change in the S&P 500 has historically been associated with a transitory change of only 3-5 hundredths of 1% in real GDP, with the bulk of that relationship being in the first few quarters of an expansion, as stocks typically turn up before GDP does. By encouraging speculators to drive stock prices to more than twice their pre-bubble valuation norms (on the measures most strongly correlated with actual subsequent market returns - see Setting the Record Straight), the Fed has managed to provoke a temporary response amounting to a few percent more GDP in this recovery than we might otherwise have enjoyed. But the economic payback may be unpleasant as this extreme market overvaluation unwinds. Further speculation will simply worsen that outcome. 
Now, before the financial crisis, there was a somewhat stronger "wealth effect" between housing values and consumption, but that's because house price appreciation did have a history of being reliably permanent. The housing bubble and crash changed that, and it may be some time until that link is restored. Stock price appreciation, on the other hand, has never had a record of being permanent, despite exciting advances like those that led to the 1929, 1972, 1987, 2000, and 2007 peaks - all which shared the same extreme overvalued, overbought, overbullish syndrome as we've observed, without consequence (yet), in the present advance. 
Put simply, the idea that suppressed short term interest rates are reliably "stimulative," and the concept of a material "wealth effect" from stock prices to the real economy are both among the broken links between things the Federal Reserve can affect (short-term interest rates, yield-seeking speculation) and those it wishes to affect (employment, GDP). Pushing harder on the accelerator pedal has simply caused a speculative bubble across nearly every class of risky assets, pulled consumption forward from the future, encouraged massive issuance of low-grade debt, and  continues to starve the elderly, the disabled, and others who rely on interest income of any source of safe return. 
The real Phillips Curve  and the phony one
Next in the parade of overly simplified relationships is one  that might be pulled directly from any randomly-selected thought bubble floating  out of a window at the Federal Reserve: the Phillips Curve.
What’s interesting about the Phillips Curve is that when  A.W. Phillips wrote his original Economica paper in 1958 - The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of  Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957 – he was  looking at two things: one being wage inflation, and the other being wage inflation in a century of data where the  United Kingdom was on the gold standard and general prices were quite stable. So what Phillips actually found, and what can be  replicated in data across the globe, is a relationship between unemployment and real wage inflation. It’s actually a  very straightforward scarcity relationship: when labor is scarce (unemployment is low), its price tends to rise  relative to the price of other goods in the economy. The reverse is true when  labor is plentiful. Here’s what that relationship looks like in data since the  mid-1970’s (using average hourly compensation divided by the GDP deflator).  It’s not a tight curve, but it essentially reflects what Phillips observed. 

Over time, what the economics profession has done is to drop  the words “real wage” and state the Phillips curve as a relationship between  unemployment and general price  inflation. A whole range of variations capture numerous equally bad assertions,  ranging from the notion that one can obtain more jobs by “allowing” more  inflation, to the idea that inflation risk need not be considered unless the  rate of unemployment is “too low.” The chart below presents what’s probably the  most popular variant – the idea that low unemployment triggers subsequent  inflation, but you can demonstrate all of the other bad variants to yourself  with an Excel spreadsheet over lunch, in the time it takes for the Fed to create  another hundred million dollars of monetary amphetamine. Not quite a “curve,”  is it?

Probably the strongest feature of the foregoing chart is the  tendency for inflation to move higher and lower in trends that have very little  to do with unemployment, and for unemployment to move up and down in trends  that have very little to do with inflation. Not to ruin a good theory with the  facts, the failure of this misguided Phillips Curve formulation to describe the  real world has resulted in a wide variety of ways to “augment” it using  expectations, varying “natural” rates of unemployment, and so forth. The idea  seems to be that using the right set of assumptions, we can make sense of the  fact that the planets that circle around the Earth keep stopping and going  backwards. We’re still far from the point that the Fed realizes, as Copernicus  did, that the prevailing dogma is not descriptive of the world. 
The winner-take-all  economy
Several factors contribute to the broad sense that something  in the economy is not right despite exuberant financial markets and a lower  rate of unemployment. In our view, the primary factor is two decades of  Fed-encouraged misallocation of capital to speculative uses, coupled with the  crash of two bubbles (and we suspect a third on the way). This repeated misallocation of investment resources has  contributed to a  thinning of our capital base that would not have occurred otherwise. The Fed has repeatedly followed  a  policy course that sacrifices long-term growth by encouraging speculative malinvestment out of impatience for short-term gain. Sustainable repair will only emerge from undistorted, less immediate, but more efficient capital allocation.
In recent years, the  U.S. has experienced a collapse in labor participation and weak growth in  labor compensation, coupled with an increasingly lopsided distribution of  whatever benefits the recent economic recovery has generated. This is not well-explained by Phillips Curves or simplistic appeals to "insufficient demand," and it is unlikely to be improved by endless monetary “stimulus” (the targets that clearly occupy the  Fed’s thinking). While our economic challenges can be largely traced to more than a decade  of persistent Fed-enabled misallocation of capital, most of the costs of this misallocation have fallen on labor because of  a) shifting  composition of labor demand that has resulted from an increasing share of  international trade with countries with heavy populations of  relatively unskilled labor; and b) economic features that increasingly create a  “winner-take-all” distribution of economic gains.  
One of the key results in international economics is that as  trade opens up between nations, those nations will tend to export goods that  intensely use the factor (skilled labor, unskilled labor, capital) with which  they are relatively well-endowed. In a world where we have opened up trade with  countries that are densely populated with unskilled workers, and where the U.S.  is relatively better endowed with  skilled labor and capital, the result has been something of a hollowing out of  the middle class among households that aren’t themselves endowed with skilled  labor or capital. Essentially, the U.S. obtains the services of low-skilled  labor more cheaply from abroad than domestically. There is no great debate on  this point. 
Meanwhile, transfer payments like welfare and unemployment  compensation allow many households to maintain consumption despite being out of  those jobs, and given the ability of households to take on debt, even if they  are actually living paycheck to paycheck, the produced goods get purchased,  companies make a profit, government runs a deficit, the Fed keeps interest  rates low which allows all the debt to be serviced, and everyone is pleasantly,  if unsustainably, happy. That’s particularly true as long as nobody asks how  the debt will be repaid, which is certainly what Fed policy encourages. 
Now, looking at nations as a whole, academic economists  proudly derive various theorems to prove that both nations actually benefit in  aggregate from international trade. The problem, however, is in the distribution of those gains. This is  particularly true in what might be called “winner-take-all” economies.
Why do professional athletes, movie actors, and even some  23-year-old computer programmers earn so much more than teachers, nurses, and  factory-line workers? The answer is simple. They’ve found a way to spread the  impact of their efforts over a very large number of individuals, while the  teachers, nurses, and factory-line workers can apply their efforts to a dramatically  smaller number of “units,” be they students, patients, or boxes of Corn Flakes.  For massive too-big-to-fail banks, the units are dollars. The downside is that as  certain winners are able to spread their efforts over an enormous number of  people, the required number of  winners declines – ask anyone who has ever tried to become a movie actor or a  pro-basketball player. International trade and internet communications, among  other developments, have significantly increased that tendency toward winner-take-all  outcomes. When that effect is expanded through international trade, the result  is that yes, each country benefits in aggregate, but you also observe a  “hollowing out” of the middle class, particularly for families that don’t have  labor or capital that shares in the distribution. 
The following charts provide some insight into this shift in  the distribution of economic gains. The first shows 5-year growth rates of real  productivity and real wages across history. Think of these figures this way:  productivity is the amount of output that an hour of labor produces, while real  wages are the amount of output that an hour of labor can command. In the  long-run, we know that the best way to produce a rising standard of living is  to increase productivity through innovation and sound allocation of savings and  resources. But notice that in recent years, labor has been getting less of the  benefit. While non-farm productivity has grown at a sluggish 1.3% annual rate  over the past 5 years, real wage growth has been trapped near zero. The  widening gap between productivity growth and real wage growth is part of the  reason Americans feel that there is something wrong. 

It shouldn’t take much thought to recognize that this gap is  one of the reasons for the growing income disparity between ordinary Americans  and those who have benefited from wide corporate profit margins and Fed-induced  speculation. While competition tends to normalize profit margins over time, and  is likely to do so even if some gap persists between productivity and real  wages, corporate profits have benefited from an unusually wide gap in recent  years, as well as low interest rates and poor capture of revenues from existing  corporate tax treatment. (As a side note, stocks are financial instruments with  roughly 50-year duration, not 3, 5, or 10 year duration – if you think these  factors are enough to pay top dollar for current earnings because current profit margins can be  “explained,” you’re kidding yourself). While we don’t believe that the present  gap is likely to be sustained, it’s clear that Americans are right to feel that  something is amiss. In the chart below, the orange line shows annual growth in real productivity in excess of real labor compensation over the preceding 5-year period (left scale), while the blue line shows domestic profits as a percentage of final sales (right scale). Note that profit  margins tend to mirror the excess of real productivity growth over real labor  compensation.

Rainforests and  resilience
How can policy makers help to build the economy from the  middle-out, and slow the both the unproductive diversion and the lopsided  distribution of resources in our economic system? 
First, we should begin by stopping the harm. Quantitative  easing will not help to reverse this process. The dogmatic pursuit of Phillips  Curve effects, attempting to lower unemployment with easy money, has done  little to materially change employment beyond what is likely to have occurred  without such extraordinary intervention, but has contributed to speculative  imbalances and an increasingly uneven income distribution. Indeed, Fed policy  does violence to the economy by helping to narrow it to what complex systems  theorists call a “monoculture.” Nearly every minute of business television is now  dominated by the idea that the Federal Reserve is the only thing that matters.  Meanwhile, by pursuing a policy that distinctly benefits those enterprises  whose primary cost is interest itself, the Fed’s policies have preserved and  enhanced too-big-to-fail banks, financial engineering, and speculative international  capital flows at the expense of local lending, small and medium-size banks and  enterprises, and ultimately, economic diversity. 
In his book, Hidden Order, complex systems theorist John  Holland (who originated the use of genetic algorithms in computing) observed  that despite extremely poor soil in a tropical rain forest, even a single tree  can harbor over 10,000 different species of life because “the forest departs  from the simple version of a food web, in which resources are only passed  upward to the top predator. Instead, cycle after cycle traps the resources so  they are used and reused before they finally make their way to the river  system. Agents that participate in cyclic flows cause the system to retain  resources. The resources so retained can be further exploited – they offer new  niches to be exploited by new kinds of agents. Parts of a complex adaptive  system that exploit these possibilities, particularly parts that further  enhance recycling, will thrive. Parts that fail to do so will lose their  resources to those that do. This is natural selection writ large. It is a  process that leads to increasing diversity through increasing recycling.”  Thriving, resilient economies work the same way. Monocultures are the exact  opposite. 
The economic equivalent of an adaptable system is one that  discourages mammoth institutions, foreign outsourcing, large-scale financial  distortions, and speculative capital flows, and instead creates a policy  environment that helps to allocate scarce savings to productive investment, encourages  small and medium size banks and enterprises, expands the availability of  capital to small businesses, and enables the local “recycling” of capital and  economic activity. This doesn’t have to be centrally planned, nor does it  require trade protections. All it needs is an environment where capital and  resources aren’t badly misdirected based on manipulated interest rates and  policies that encourage speculation. Much of the harm comes from a Federal  Reserve that appears singularly focused on “massive macro” – the epic and  untargeted flooding of the financial system with liquidity to satisfy some  dogmatic experiment focused on economic relationships that can’t even be  clearly established in the data. 
The always observant Charles Hugh Smith puts it this way:  “Diversity and adaptability go together; each is a feature of the other. The  Federal Reserve has created an unstable monoculture of an economy. What should  have triggered a ‘die off’ of one predatory species – the ‘too big to fail’  mortgage/commercial banks and the Wall Street investment banks – was  redistributed to all other participants. In insulating participants from risk,  fact-finding, and volatility, you make price discovery and thus stability  impossible.”
Rather than breeding a resilient economy by allowing the  undistorted allocation of capital, rather than taking any lesson from a global  financial crisis whose growing risks Yellen dismissed with “No,  No, and No,” the Fed has created a food web that channels resources to the  top predators, and ensures that scarce capital is diverted to the use of  financial engineers and speculators. For someone who wants to help the middle  class, the jobless, and ordinary Americans, Janet Yellen – as well meaning as  we honestly believe she is – may inadvertently make matters quite a bit worse  if her benign view of growing financial risk continues. 
Broken links in the  chain of cause and effect
The Federal Reserve’s prevailing view of the world seems to  be that a) QE lowers interest rates, b) lower interest rates stimulate jobs and  economic activity, c) the only risk from QE will be at the point when  unemployment is low enough to trigger inflation, and d) the Fed can safely encourage  years of yield-seeking speculation – of the same sort that produced the worst  economic collapse since the Depression – on the belief that this time is  different. From the foregoing discussion, it should be clear that this chain of  cause and effect is a very mixed bag of fact and fiction. 
To be fair, we do believe that some components of the Fed’s thinking are well-supported by economic  evidence. For example, in her presentation at Jackson Hole, Fed Chair Janet  Yellen observed that real wage inflation remains low, and that this is an  indication of ongoing slack in the labor market that isn’t well-captured by the  rate of unemployment. On this point, we would completely agree. To the extent  that the true Phillips Curve (which  relates unemployment to real wage inflation) describes reality, it’s sensible  to assert that low real wage inflation informs us that the unemployment rate  has not declined to a level that reflects labor market scarcity – though we  should also recognize that real wage growth would already be much higher if there was not such an extreme gap between  real wage growth and productivity growth. 
Where we differ from Chair Yellen is in a variety of  supposed cause-effect relationships that aren’t supported by evidence to any  meaningful extent, and in the neglect of systemic risks that are undeniable if  one has been paying any attention at all to the macroeconomy over the past 15  years. 
Let’s summarize the links in the chain of cause and  effect. First, as demonstrated above, it’s clear that increasing the monetary base relative to nominal  GDP will predictably and reliably lower short-term interest rates. This is true  at least until the point that, as has occurred across history and across  countries, inflation picks up rather uncontrollably – often following a supply  shock coupled with government deficit spending – with very little at all to do  with the prevailing unemployment rate. In any event, nearly a century of data  provides very clear evidence of a tight link between monetary base/nominal GDP  and the level of short-term interest rates.
The next link in the chain is the assumption that suppressed  short-term interest rates are somehow good for economic growth and job creation.  Here, the cause-and-effect link is much weaker. It’s certainly true that  suppressed short-term interest rates result in yield-seeking and the enhanced  availability of loans to low-quality borrowers who offer higher yields than are  available on safe alternatives. But it’s also clear that QE does not do much to  stimulate real investment, where there are numerous costs and risks beyond the  cost of money (and where hundreds of billions of idle dollars are available on  corporate balance sheets even in the absence of further QE). Rather, QE  primarily encourages speculation, leveraged finance, and other forms of financial  “engineering” where interest represents the primary expense. The objective of  these activities is not job creation, but leveraging the “spread” between the  return on one financial asset and the interest that one must pay to acquire it  with borrowed money. 
On Yellen’s inflation views, the argument that general price  inflation will only follow real wage inflation is really an argument that general price inflation will only follow  low unemployment. At best, this view is half right. There’s good evidence that  low unemployment tends to result in higher real wage inflation (the real  Phillips Curve), but it does not follow that real wage inflation is naturally  associated with faster general price inflation. Indeed, because general prices  are the denominator of real wages,  faster general price inflation tends to reduce real wages in the absence of a spiral in all nominal prices where wages take the lead. That’s just arithmetic. Aside from  some short-term cyclical pressures, we’re not terribly concerned about rapid  inflation at present, but we also don’t find much evidence that unemployment,  whether at current levels or lower levels, is the central factor that would  determine inflation anyway. 
The most dangerous assumption of the Fed is that the primary  risk of QE is inflation, and that QE is somehow a benign policy in the absence  of inflation risk. Yes, we would love to see lower unemployment, and agree that  stronger growth in real wages would likely result from that. It’s just that the  transmission mechanism from QE and zero-interest rate speculation to lower  unemployment is either nonexistent or so poorly defined that the policy can  only be considered reckless. The Phillips Curve dogma of the Fed has created  blinders that narrow its view of risk to some abstract “tradeoff” between inflation  and unemployment. Meanwhile, the speculative pitch of the markets is  contributing to a very real risk of steep financial disruptions, not only  because risk-assets are overvalued, but because debt is increasingly being  purchased on the basis of yield rather than the careful evaluation of repayment  prospects. 
So the greatest risk of QE is not the inflation risk  that may or may not emerge, but the financial distortion, overvaluation, and  speculation that is already baked in  the cake and is progressively worsening, in a manner quite similar to the 2000  and 2007 extremes, though less evident because the cyclical elevation of profit  margins makes prices seem tolerable relative to current earnings. As I’ve  frequently noted, based on equity valuation measures that are most reliably correlated with actual  subsequent stock market returns, stocks are now more than double their  pre-bubble historical norms, and presently suggest that the S&P 500 will be  no higher a decade from now than it is today. We expect the current QE bubble  to unwind no more kindly than the prior bubbles in 2000 and 2007. As in those instances, my view remains that speculators who successfully exit this bubble will do so through the eye of a needle, and that the  exit signal most envision will be far noisier and less timely than they imagine. See Ockham's Razor and the  Market Cycle and Yes,  This is An Equity Bubble for additional background on these concerns.
As for the U.S. economy, QE-induced speculation misallocates resources that might otherwise contribute to long-run growth, and while conditions could certainly be worse, the benefits of this economic recovery have been highly uneven. Again, 40% of families report that  they are “just getting by,” with the majority essentially living paycheck to  paycheck without enough savings to cover even a few months of expenses. We  could be, and should be doing better, except that this complex adaptive system of  ours responds to good incentives as well as bad ones, and has been repeatedly  crippled by policies that have produced waves of malinvestment, bubble, and  collapse. The economy is starting to take on features of a winner-take-all  monoculture that encourages and subsidizes too-big-to-fail banks and large-scale  financial speculation at the expense of productive real investment and  small-to-medium size enterprises. These are outcomes that our policy makers at  the Fed have single-handedly chosen for us in the well-meaning belief that the economy is helped by extraordinary financial  distortions. The Federal Reserve is right to wind down quantitative easing, and  would best terminate reinvestment of maturing holdings, ideally beginning in  October or quickly thereafter. The issue is not whether the U.S. economy does or  does not need “life support.” The issue is that QE is not life support in the  first place.

Feature Article: 
When Market Trends Break, Even Borderline Data is Recessionary                
When stock market action  deteriorates and broad economic data is weakening even moderately, the risks of  a recession actually jump considerably. The conditional probability of a  recession prior to the market falling below its 12-month moving average was  just 5-10 percent. It has now jumped to between 60 and 75 percent. This is roughly  6 or 7 times the odds that economists are allowing for a recession.

This Week: 
Wrecking Ball
                 
           What’s often missed in the “low interest rates justify  higher valuations” argument is that this proposition assumes that future cash  flows and growth rates are held  constant. By responding to low interest rates by elevating P/E multiples, without accounting for depressed long-term nominal economic growth prospects, and to base those P/E multiples on earnings that embed elevated profit margins  (driven by a shortfall between wage growth and productivity that has already begun  to reverse as the unemployment rate pushes 4.4%) is to drive prospective  returns down three times; a mistaken form  of triple-counting that is precisely why  expected 10-12 year market returns are presently so weak. The pendulum of speculation has swung far and has grown increasingly  grotesque in order to reach this point. It will be a wrecking ball when it  returns to earth.

When Market Trends Break, 
Even Borderline Data is Recessionary
When stock market action  deteriorates and broad economic data is weakening even moderately, the risks of  a recession actually jump considerably. The conditional probability of a  recession prior to the market falling below its 12-month moving average was  just 5-10 percent. It has now jumped to between 60 and 75 percent. This is roughly  6 or 7 times the odds that economists are allowing for a recession.

Mutual Fund Brokerage Fees and Trading Costs 
How much do mutual funds pay in commissions and trading costs? This is a question that the mutual fund industry seems reluctant to answer. In an industry already complicated by fees - sales loads, soft dollars, trailing fees, 12b-1 marketing fees - asking mutual funds to prominently disclose trading costs is unpopular among fund companies. We've decided to take the lead anyway. It's the right thing to do.
By John P. Hussman, Ph.D.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.
