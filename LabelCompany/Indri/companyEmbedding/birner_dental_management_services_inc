Our Company
Birner Dental Management Services, Inc. is a
publicly traded business services organization (OTCQX Best Market:
BDMS), a dental
franchise that serves a network of dental offices marketed under
the names of PERFECT TEETH™.  Established in 1995, we are the
largest provider of high quality, comprehensive dental care in
Colorado and New Mexico with a growing presence in Arizona. On two
separate occasions we have been included on Fortune Small Business
Magazine's list of America's Top 100 Fastest growing
Small Public Companies.
We recognize that operating a successful dental practice has
become more difficult as the practice environment has become more
complex. Our company is dedicated to the idea of letting dentists be
dentists by removing the business services and allowing
our dentist to focus on patient care.
At PERFECT TEETH™, we are committed to putting patients' needs
first at all times, while providing high-quality dental
services to insured and uninsured patients.

DENVER, May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Birner Dental Management Services, Inc. (OTCQX: BDMS), business services provider of PERFECT TEETH® dental practices, announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, revenue decreased $771,000, or 4.7%, to $15.7 million compared to $16.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The Company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense ("Adjusted EBITDA") decreased $227,000, or 22.7%, to $777,000.  Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased $125,000 to $(225,000) compared to $(100,000) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Loss per share increased to $(0.12) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $(0.05) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.








Despite challenging comparisons of the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to the same quarter in 2016, the Company believes there are meaningful signs of progress.  As previously reported, the Company believes much of the decline in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA has been driven by a decrease in the number of dentists in the network.  The dentist count was 112 at March 31, 2016 and had declined to 98 at December 31, 2016. As a result of management's actions, the Company believes this trend is beginning to reverse as evidenced by the Company's increasing its dentist count to 102 at March 31, 2017.  Furthermore, dentist productivity, as measured by daily revenue per practicing dentist, increased 8.3% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  In addition, patient flow continues to be strong with new patient visits up 8.2% in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 versus the same quarter in 2016.  As dentist count increases, management believes operating results will improve through increased revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.  
During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company had capital expenditures of $156,000 and decreased total bank debt outstanding by approximately $655,000.  The Company was in compliance with its first quarter 2017 bank credit facility covenants, including the EBITDA covenant as a result of $104,000 of expenses related to the strategic assessment that commenced in the second quarter of 2016 and was discontinued in the first quarter of 2017, which the bank permitted the Company to add back to EBITDA.     
The Company also announced that it has reached an agreement in principle, pending receipt of signatures, with a group of shareholders regarding a mutual settlement agreement to end a potential proxy contest related to the Company's upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. Under the terms of the pending settlement agreement, the Company will nominate John M. Climaco and Gregory G. Fulton for election to its board of directors at the 2017 annual meeting, along with incumbent director Brooks G. O'Neil. "The board and management team believe this settlement serves the best interests of the Company, its shareholders and employees," said Fred Birner, the Company's Chairman and CEO. "We welcome these new nominees to our board. We look forward to putting this matter behind us and to getting back to the business of growing the Company and building shareholder value." As part of the pending settlement agreement, the shareholder group has agreed to withdraw its proposals for the annual meeting and to vote in favor of the above slate of director nominees at the 2017 annual meeting. In addition, the shareholder group agrees to a standstill that generally extends until the later of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders and the date neither Mr. Climaco nor Mr. Fulton serves on the board, except that the shareholder group may propose nominees for director for the 2018 annual meeting in accordance with the Company's bylaws. 
Birner Dental Management Services, Inc. acquires, develops, and manages geographically dense dental practice networks in select markets in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company managed 68 dental offices, of which 35 were acquired and 33 were de novo developments. The Company operates its dental offices under the PERFECT TEETH® name. 
The Company previously announced it would conduct a conference call to review results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 on Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. MT. In addition to current operating results, the teleconference may include discussion of management's expectations of future financial and operating results. To participate in this conference call, dial in to 1-888-471-3820 and refer to Confirmation Code 5570786 approximately five minutes prior to the scheduled time. If you are unable to join the conference call on May 11, 2017, the rebroadcast number is 1-888-203-1112 with the pass code of 5570786.  This rebroadcast will be available through May 25, 2017.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain of the matters discussed herein may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is not a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure of performance or liquidity. However, the Company believes that it may be useful to an investor in evaluating the Company's ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA for this purpose.  Investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company's operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss can be made by adding depreciation and amortization expense - offices, depreciation and amortization expense – Corporate, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense, net and income tax benefit to net loss as in the table below.
