Marie A. Chandoha, President And Chief Executive Officer Of Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Aug 25, 2016 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Charles Schwab Investment Management ( CSIM), a leader in both target date funds (TDFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), announced today the launch of Schwab Target Index Funds - a new series of index-based target date mutual funds constructed with low-cost Schwab ETFs™ as underlying investments. The new funds are the lowest-cost target date mutual funds available to employer-sponsored retirement plans, with an across-the-board expense ratio of just eight basis points (0.08%) and no minimum investment requirements regardless of plan size 1. Until now, receiving the most competitive pricing on target date funds could require a $100 million minimum investment or more from retirement plans. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160825005129/en/   Marie A. Chandoha, President and Chief Executive Officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. (Photo: Business Wire)   Outside of retirement plans, Schwab Target Index Funds are also among the lowest-cost target date mutual funds available to individual investors at 13 basis points (0.13%) with only a $100 minimum investment 1.  The new series includes funds with target retirement dates between 2010 and 2060 in five-year increments. A complete list of Schwab target date mutual funds, including the new funds and their ticker symbols, can be found here.  Schwab Target Index Funds are an important addition to Schwab's well-established TDF suite, first launched in 2002, which includes mutual funds and collective trust funds, open architecture construction and active and passive strategies.  "Today marks an important day of democratization for employers, retirement plan participants and self-directed individual investors," said Marie Chandoha, president and chief executive officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management. "With Schwab Target Index Funds, every retirement plan gets the same low price with no investment minimums. That means plan participants no longer have to pay for a more expensive target date fund just because they work at a smaller company. On the retail side, we're proud to offer individual investors a professionally managed retirement solution at an exceptionally low price. As the latest example of Schwab's long history of driving down costs, these new funds are important milestones for our industry, and great news for retirement savers."  Cost Matters  The underlying assets in Schwab Target Index Funds are primarily Schwab's market-cap index ETFs, each of which has the lowest operating expenses in its respective Lipper category 2. It is the result of this construction that allows CSIM to offer the new funds at such low prices.  The impact of keeping expenses down is enormous, especially for products designed to be held over a long period of time. To demonstrate that point, CSIM has released a short motion graphic illustrating how lower fees alone can mean a significant increase in savings at retirement.  Retirement plan participants appear to understand the impact of cost. New data from Schwab finds fees are top of mind when workers choose to invest in their plan's TDFs, second in importance only to the fund's 5-year performance record 3.  "At a time when some asset managers are inundating investors with confusing, complex products, we're experiencing greater demand for our straightforward, transparent products that deliver great value on their own or with professional management built in," said Chandoha. "Schwab ETFs function as key ingredients we draw on to develop affordable managed solutions like Schwab Target Index Funds. We think this is uniquely powerful and relevant against the backdrop of changing client expectations."

Once set on becoming a dancer, Marie Chandoha's initiation into the finance world was an article about mortgage-backed securities sent to her by a friend. "I was fascinated," Chandoha recalls.Her curiosity eventually led to a job as a mortgage-backed securities analyst on the floor at Morgan Stanley. "In no time, I was hooked," she says. "I moved to the asset management side of the business mid-way through my career to be closer to the end client and help investors achieve their financial goals."

Insights from Marie ChandohaPresident and CEO
Women in Financial Services – Power in the Pipeline
May 2017
Here’s something you should know about me – my entry into financial services wasn’t really that deliberate. I feel like I entered the industry somewhat accidentally. There were signs of an interest in finance when I was young. I liked to play monopoly. I loved going to the bank with my mother. I was interested in how money worked. And I was really good at math, and later on thought finance would be a good way to apply those skills in a career. But I also know a lot of women who work in financial services, yet never imagined they would do so when they were young. 
The topic of evolving the complexion of the financial industry is something that I think about regularly. The complexion of the industry continues to be out of kilter with the complexion of the clients we serve, and our nation. White men still represent the majority of those raising their hands to enter the financial services industry. Changing the complexion of our industry begins with building a more diverse pipeline.
Last week I spent time at the University of Akron at a symposium dedicated to building a more diverse pipeline in financial services and shared the following observations about what I believe can make a difference:

First, we need to spread the word. We need to get the word out that this is a great career path for diverse candidates. A recent college graduate in my organization told me she had no idea this career path even existed. She felt she had landed in her job by accident, similar to my experience. We are never going to change the complexion of this industry, or build a pipeline by accident. Those of us in the industry need to reach out more consistently to universities, other partners, and career influencers to get the word out. I have been impressed by organizations like Girls Who Invest (a non-profit Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. sponsors) that spread the word among college women about careers in portfolio management, provide training and help those women enter internships. Internships focused on bringing in more diverse candidates are also a terrific way to spread the word.
Secondly, as we start recruiting, we need to build the confidence of women and other minorities that this career path is within reach. People who experience bias in their lives often feel their confidence erode over time through their daily experiences. Being in this industry for over 30 years, I continue to see a confidence gap between men and women in the workplace, which I believe starts well before they ever enter the workforce. Studies show women tend not to apply for jobs unless they have the majority of the skills listed in the job description, where men will apply for jobs even if they have only a few of the skills required.  
Finally, we need to support our diverse candidates. Sometimes, we attract diverse candidates but they end up dropping out. I think firm culture plays a key role in fostering diversity. Diversity can thrive in respectful and inclusive cultures. I frequently see our diverse candidates asking questions about the culture because they know it makes such a big difference in their ultimate success. Supporting diverse candidates through mentorship can also be effective. For me, I had many advisors along the way who helped me through difficult situations and made a big difference in my career. And I am so grateful for that. 

One thing that I do find exciting is the number of women who have risen up the ranks over the last decade. When I started in this business, there were few female role models in executive positions. And when there were, they didn’t seem to stay in their roles long. Today, in the Bay Area, there are four women CEOs of asset management companies. At Charles Schwab, we have five female executives on our executive leadership team. I can’t tell you how many times a woman has come up to me and said, “Wow, you really give me hope that I can progress in my career.” The fact that women are rising through the ranks as never before serves as an incredible beacon to young women considering their career choices. If you can see it, you can be it. 
Those of us fortunate enough to see beyond its complexion today know what a truly great industry this is. At the end of the day, the industry exists to serve others. Let’s rally together and help young women and minorities find their way within the financial services industry so we can serve the clients of the future in the best way possible.
