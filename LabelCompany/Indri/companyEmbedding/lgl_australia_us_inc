Marine Mammal and Acoustic Research
For more than 45 years, LGL has conducted marine mammal research and monitoring along the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, and Gulf of Mexico coasts of Canada and the U.S.A., as well as numerous projects overseas, including eastern Russia.
LGL and associates literally "wrote the book" on effects of noise on marine mammals. After years of studies of the effects of industrial disturbance on whales and other marine mammals in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, LGL scientists compiled their information with collaborating partners to publish a comprehensive treatise on the subject (Marine Mammals and Noise, 1995, Academic Press).

With roots in precision crystal filters for radar in 1965, MtronPTI designs and manufactures RF & microwave solutions for data timing and radio frequency spectrum control in high reliability and harsh environment applications. Formed in 2004 with the acquisition of Piezo Technology, Inc. by M-tron Industries, Inc., MtronPTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the LGL Group, Inc.

In aerospace and defense markets, MtronPTI’s digitally tuned filters support secure communications in the presence of electromagnetic interference. Low drift, highly accurate oscillators provide reliable frequency lock for ground, vehicle, air and satellite communication as well as electronic countermeasures. Vibration and shock resistant crystal clocks sharpen radar images and help monitor commercial aircraft engine performance.

For Internet communication, MtronPTI very low noise and packet sync clocks help increase bandwidth and prevent data loss in cellular base stations, micro and femto cells and Wi-Fi access points. Millimeter wave filters ensure corporate and telecom point-to-point links stay error free.

On the lab bench or consumer electronics production test floors, MtronPTI ultra low noise frequency reference oscillators insure accurate measurements. When public safety is paramount, MtronPTI wide temperature range/waterproof cavity filters insure reliable radio communication.

Satellite links, phased array radars and anti-IED jammers use MtronPTI RF power amplifiers to boost the signal to the antenna.
