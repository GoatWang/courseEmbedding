The Company
 

Our research on Nitric Oxide first began with the discovery of its unique impact on cardiovascular health. Its immense importance as a biological signaling molecule resulted in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 1998. Realizing that the discovery of Nitric Oxide had immense potential, it didn’t take long for our interest in N-O to become our passion. 
Dr. Nathan Bryan, our Chief Science Officer and co-founder, has committed his life’s work to the field of N-O research. By partnering with leading N-O discovery programs, such as the University of Texas Health Science Center, Dr. Bryan has identified and continues to identify ways to replenish the body’s N-O, and even help the body to promote optimal N-O function.

Ready to bring N-O to the masses, Dr. Bryan co-founded Neogenis Laboratories, now HumanN, in 2009. Consulting with the top N-O scientists, doctors, registered dietitians, and healthcare thought-leaders, there is no other company more committed, or qualified, to bringing the best N-O functional foods and supplements to every human across every phase of life.

Recovery: Tools of the Trade « AshleyHigz

Recovery: Tools of the Trade 


 
This year, I have had a little more time then I used to. While perhaps that has meant an increase in milage by about 5%, what the extra time has really been critical for is to learn to utilize RECOVERY to help me be prepared to workout harder and gain those small improvements. At this stage, the hope is to improve by seconds, percentage points, not leaps and bounds. Thankfully, I have been so lucky to learn about and be supported by a few AMAZING brands that deserve a shout – out here.


Roll Recovery: Made my runners and athletes, these tools are fantastic as a means of self maintenance and massage before and after runs and especially hard efforts. The R3 roller is fabulous for plantar, a problem I struggled with in a major way all last year. In addition, the R8 roller is perfect for getting those muscles that stick (like IT Bands and calves for me!) to loosen up a bit and relax after you put them through a hard effort. Moreover, they are killing it with this classy mat that makes pre and post run stretching and prep a lot more stylish and comfy.
Cheribundi: I love tart cherry juice and have become obsessed with this brand for a few years now. These perfect sized bottles come in three types, regular, recovery, and relax. Personally, I use the recovery post workout to have some quick protein and have the relax at night as it helps me get to bed. It is even replaced my favorite, red wine, at times ! Now that is a high compliment.
Enduropacks: Made my triathletes who understand the rigors of intense training, this product has been a new addition to my line up and made a huge difference in my opinion. I truly feel more recovered than ever. First off, their pack consists of a daily multivitamin in the morning, an electrolyte spray that I can spritz right into my water bottle or even just straight into my mouth to gain some quick electrolytes, and then a recovery patch with amino acids I use after hard workout days. There are also glutamine pills for the evening that just aid in sleep in recovery. There is nothing better that products created by people who have been there and saw the need for something. I highly recommend giving them a shot, especially if you, like me, need a one stop shop for the vitamins and right stuff an athlete’s body needs!
Beet Elite: I started trying Beet Elite powder with a bit of water right before my hardest sessions and have not stopped since. As someone who hates beets, the new runner food to many, this product helps give me the boost and nitric oxide that is so good for runners but in a tastier form that I can enjoy. Mainly, it helps me feel ready to take on those hard, fast, lactic acid inducing sessions without fear!

                               
In addition, USATF has partnered with other companies who have made a big difference in the little things that are really big things. First HelloFresh has helped make healthy good meals affordable for my budget. Eating the right stuff shouldn’t be excusable for any reason. It is also fun to have so many new exciting recipes! Second, getting my very own Normatec has been amazing! Not only is it so fun for my non-runner friends and family to watch it work, but it really helps my legs feel as if I have gotten a message or ice bath after 10-15 minutes in the boots. For me, having an attachment for my hips has also really helped me with hurdle workouts and soreness.
So – THANK YOU guys for helping me be a better athlete and more prepared for the tough races ahead.

We stand on the shoulders of giants
to bring Nitric Oxide to the world.






Science is at the core of our company. And our products. 
 
Building on the 1998 Nobel prize-winning research and Nitric Oxide research studies that have since followed, HumanN’s Dr. Nathan Bryan was recruited by the Nobel Laureate to work in the N-O Discovery Program at the University of Texas. 
It was through this program that Dr. Bryan discovered a safe and natural way to get the body to restore its N-O function. Wanting to bring this technology to the masses, he co-founded Neogenis Laboratories, now HumanN, in 2009.
Dr. Bryan, one of today’s most recognized experts in Nitric Oxide research, is credited with a number of significant discoveries in Nitric Oxide function and metabolism. He has been published extensively in the field and holds nine patents or patents pending related to Nitric Oxide.
As the company expanded its Nitric Oxide reach into sports nutrition, renowned Dr. John Ivy joined the company as
 
Executive Director of Sport & Nutrition Research. Dr. Ivy is considered one of the world’s leading scientists in the areas of sports nutrition and protein synthesis, authoring over 170 scientific papers and several books, including the well-known and respected Nutrient Timing: The Future of Sports Nutrition. Working with notable sports greats, including Michael Phelps during his training for the 2012 Summer Olympics, his contributions to sports nutrition and science are unparalleled. 
Today, Dr. Bryan and Dr. Ivy are joined by HumanN’s Scientific Advisory Board, comprised of an impressive team of scientists across a range of disciplines.

How N-O Works
Why Levels Fall
How to Replenish
N-O Impacts
N-O Verified






Nitric Oxide is essential to all life.

So it’s essential that we all know about it.






What is Nitric Oxide (N-O)?
Nitric Oxide is critical in our bodies. Without it, we can’t live. In fact, the
loss of Nitric Oxide has been linked to cardiovascular health and has been
called the greatest discovery in cardiovascular medicine.












N-O signals our blood vessels to relax, helping to dilate the arteries and increase circulation. It is essential to our very existence. And while it’s abundant in our body’s systems, it’s unstable and depletes, requiring it to be replenished. 


Nitric oxide (N-O) is a gas composed of one atom of nitrogen bonded to one atom of oxygen. It serves as a critical signaling molecule in the cardiovascular and circulatory system. That means it affects absolutely every function in our bodies—it’s at the foundational core because without circulation, none of our body’s other systems can work as intended. 



Dubbed the “miracle molecule,” the discovery of Nitric Oxide, the first gas to be identified as such, won the Nobel Prize in 1998. This discovery is what HumanN is built on. We’re not just providing functional nutrition and supplements. We aspire to bring knowledge and understanding of the importance of N-O to the world.  


 








Nitric Oxide and the body.
 


Our cardiovascular system relies on Nitric Oxide. So, no matter your age or stage of life, N-O is critical to your health. This is especially poignant when you consider that millions of Americans have blood pressure in the higher range of normal. 
This essential molecule signals our blood vessels to relax and expand, creating greater efficiency in the body, greater nutrient delivery, greater oxygenation and so on to every system, organ and tissue in the body. It also supports healthy blood pressure. The point is that N-O is truly linked to everything we do and every breath we take


If we dive even deeper, we’ll see that Nitric Oxide is tied closely to endothelial function. The endothelium is the tissue that forms a single layer of cells lining our blood vessels and heart. 
Growing evidence suggests that promoting optimal endothelial function is associated with increased cardiovascular health. N-O helps keep the endothelium healthy; a healthy endothelium helps produce more N-O. Maintaining the proper functioning of this cycle is important for those who want to achieve their personal best at any age. 

 

 














Although Nitric Oxide research began in the 1970s, continued advancements have led to a fuller understanding of its impact on:




Supporting healthy blood pressure levels


Increasing circulation throughout the body


Promoting cardiovascular and heart health


Aiding normal, healthy circulation and arterial function


Dilating arteries for healthy blood flow











Why N-O levels drop may surprise you.

Age
We already know our bodies change as we age. This is true for Nitric Oxide levels in the body, as well. By the time we reach 40, studies have shown that we only produce about half or less of the Nitric Oxide we did at age 20. And it continues to decline as we age. There’s also a difference when it comes to gender: by 40, men produce about 50% of the N-O they did in their teens and twenties. And women only produce about 35% of what they did in their twenties at age 50. Yet, our ability to produce and generate N-O within the body is a key element of a healthy body. Which means having an effective strategy to maintain optimal levels is critical because it affects how every cell in our body communicates with each other.

 
Diet
A diet rich in green, leafy vegetables is known to be cardio healthy. For decades nutritionists
and scientists thought these effects were from the
antioxidants found in those foods. Now we know that it’s due to the dietary nitrates found in green, leafy vegetables and beets. Nitrates are metabolized into Nitric Oxide in the human body by oral nitrate-reducing bacteria. If we don’t consume enough high nitrate vegetables, then we become N-O deficient and our N-O levels begin to fall.
Additionally, people who use antiseptic mouthwash can destroy all the good bacteria in the mouth that are responsible for reducing dietary nitrate into nitrite and Nitric Oxide.  As a result, even though these individuals may eat sufficient amounts of high nitrate vegetables, they may become N-O deficient because they don’t have the right bacteria necessary for metabolizing dietary nitrate.



Exercise 
Physical exercise is the most potent stimulator of Nitric Oxide production and is considered one of the top strategies for supporting overall cardiovascular health.  However, when we don’t exercise, we lose that important signal that tells our body to make more N-O. As a result, the enzyme that makes N-O in response to exercise becomes dysfunctional. This usually leads to N-O insufficiency. Just as in the aging process, the problem is the inability to utilize L-arginine to make Nitric Oxide. The good news, however, is that once we begin to exercise we may regain the functionality of that enzyme and begin to stimulate more N-O production.









You ask a lot of your body: Replenish N-O every day.
Much like with our overall health, diet and exercise play a large role in stimulating the natural production of N-O. Including more N-O stimulating foods, or foods that are high in dietary nitrates like spinach and beetroot, is a good start. Regular exercise, which also helps to promote N-O production, is a smart addition as well. 
Unfortunately, in today’s world of refined foods these options may not be enough, especially for those over 40. That’s where functional foods, like our SuperBeets, BeetElite and supplements, like our Neo40, come in. Neo40 is a patented Nitric Oxide delivery system that generates authentic N-O gas that helps stimulate the production of N-O from the enzyme in the blood vessels, similar to exercise. Superbeets is a dietary nitrate-based food that provides the body with optimal levels of dietary nitrate and nitrite that can help make up for a diet insufficient in dietary nitrate intake. Finally, BeetElite is our super concentrated pre-workout formula that helps deliver a quick boost in Nitric Oxide production. 
Curious as to whether your current diet contains enough dietary nitrate to support healthy Nitric Oxide levels? Scientists at HumanN developed Nitric Oxide Diagnostics® Indicator Strips, the first non-invasive salivary Nitric Oxide indicator strip to give you insight into your current dietary regimen and whether supplementation is needed.









How N-O Impacts the Body



How N-O impacts heart health.
The discovery of Nitric Oxide’s effect on our cardiovascular systems was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1998. And before that, it was named the Molecule of the Year in 1992 by researchers. N-O has been given high praise with good reason. This miracle molecule is able to carry messages at the cellular level because of its gaseous state and in doing so, relaxes blood vessels in our bodies, promoting arterial dilation and increased blood flow. 
By helping regulate and fine-tune cardiac function, Nitric Oxide isn’t just important, it’s indispensable. It is intrinsically tied to our ability to function as we were intended. 


How N-O impacts circulation.
It makes sense that as Nitric Oxide relaxes the body’s blood vessels and dilates arteries, it would promote increased blood flow throughout our bodies. But how does it do so? The short answer is that Nitric Oxide and our endothelial system have a direct relationship.
More specifically, the inner lining of our blood vessels that come in contact with blood are called endothelium and endothelial cells help produce N-O. That N-O penetrates the muscles in our arteries, not only relaxing them, but also reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. And with that comes improved circulation and all the benefits associated, including the support of a healthy blood pressure, increased energy and more.






How N-O impacts healthy blood pressure levels.
We’ve already covered the N-O and endothelial relationship. If we take it a step further, it’s easy to understand how Nitric Oxide levels are crucial to healthy blood pressure levels. When arteries are dilated and circulation is increased, it can help regulate blood pressure in our bodies. 


How N-O impacts energy.
With Nitric Oxide’s ability to increase circulation and oxygenation of the blood comes the added benefits of improved natural energy and stamina. That’s why so many professional athletes look to Nitric Oxide, whether through dietary nitrates in whole foods or through functional nutrition, like our BeetElite. Because when our blood carries more oxygen to our muscles, our body becomes more efficient, delivering key nutrients and carrying away toxins. And if our body is more efficient and circulation is improved, endurance improves as well. 
However, whether you’re an athlete or not doesn’t matter. Most of us seek more energy and stamina throughout our day, whether we’re exercising or simply staying alert and focused at work. And while that may mean reaching for caffeine or an energy drink, it doesn’t have to. Because increasing your Nitric Oxide levels promotes the energy and stamina you’re looking for. We developed SuperBeets and BeetElite for exactly those reasons.  












Nitric Oxide Verified.
 We verify the Nitric Oxide potential in every HumanN Product.
There are many products on the market that claim to promote Nitric Oxide production in the body. At HumanN, we don’t make claims, we invest in clinical research. We’ve conducted seven clinical trials to date on our actual products, which have been published and peer-reviewed in medical journals. This level of commitment isn’t typical in the world of N-O functional foods and supplements—many only test their ingredients  but not the final product, and most don’t do clinical trials at all. But we think it should be, which is why we’ll continue to research, innovate, test and bring the most effective N-O activators to humans everywhere. In fact, we continually test our products to ensure there is sufficient nitrates in the products to support optimal N-O function.


A leading Nitric Oxide researcher and our Chief Science Officer at HumanN, Dr. Nathan Bryan has conducted ongoing studies on the effects of Nitric Oxide on circulation and heart health. In fact, his research inspired the formulation of our Neo40 supplement, the first and only product shown to produce authentic Nitric Oxide gas in the body.

Numerous clinical trials on our actual product formulations have also been conducted by independent third parties, including leading cardiologists like Dr. Ernst Schwarz from Cedars Sinai and Dr. Mark Houston at Vanderbilt University, something fairly uncommon in the world of functional foods and supplements and certainly uncommon amongst our competitors. 











We are driven to bring Nitric Oxide to the world—to educate, to inspire and to provide the highest quality functional nutrition and supplements possible. Conducting clinical research is a crucial part of that mission and one that we encourage our customers to review.

Dean Gartland March 15, 2017

I will be running my 9th Boston marathon in a row. I would rather get on the plane and forget my racing shoes than to forget my Beetelite.
I simply love what this stuff does for my running performance.

Derek Vandelden February 21, 2017

I’ve been pretty consistant in the gym for the past 15 years and about a year and a half ago I decided to take up running and have been racing in 5k races this past 6 months. I came across Beetelite about two months ago and am very impressed with this product. Lately I have been fighting to take seconds off my times and I recently cut over a minute off one of my 5k trail runs. Definitely feel a noticeable increase in stamina going up the hills. I will be running my second Spartan Race this summer and can’t wait to see the benefits of Beetelite, great product!

Justin Rhea February 21, 2017

Love the product! After a laborious day at work, I still can get top end performance lifting, running, and cycling. One of the things I enjoy most about BeetElite is the ability to fall asleep w/o any post workout jitters. Can’t wait until the snow melts!

Jon Jarosch January 30, 2017

I am a skeptic by nature, so I had to test the results of using Beetelite. I have been using it for over a year now for longer workouts, and I consistently see a 4-5 beat per minute lower heartrate when using Beetelite. Same treadmill, same slope, speed, etc. 
Bottom line – the stuff works and can make a big difference over the duration of a workout or race. Great product.

BeetElite Product Details

Push harder, achieve greater with N-O endurance food.
BeetElite is trusted by over 90 professional and collegiate teams at the top of their game, as well as numerous current and former Olympic athletes and aspiring professionals in the world of obstacle course racing and endurance sports. 
BeetElite, with its concentrated dietary nitrates and nitrites, helps to optimize Nitric Oxide production. If the beet product you’re taking doesn’t contain high levels of nitrates, and other nutrients, it simply can’t provide the same benefits as Beetelite. Let’s face it, none of us want to eat a ton of beets everyday even if you like the taste. That’s where HumanN rises above the rest with our growing and selection standards, scientifically supported formulations based on scientific knowledge and research. 

Our precise growing standard and selection process of non-GMO beets are grown from the highest quality seeds in a nutrient-rich growing environment

Our rigorous growing standards mean that we only harvest beets with the highest concentration of dietary nitrates

BeetElite is formulated to taste great with no artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. It’s also gluten-free and made from non-GMO beets. 

Features
One serving or six whole beets?
One recommended serving of BeetElite supplies the N-O equivalent of six whole beets. No need to fill up on several bottles of beet juice before a competition or a workout. Our concentrated endurance functional food helps the body promote:

Extended exercise endurance 
Improved energy and stamina 
Increased oxygen delivery in the body

Science
Our products have a team of scientists behind them.
Our food scientists and nutritionists work together to not only maximize the N-O activating potential in our products, but also to ensure that the body is taking in nutrients found in our functional foods with optimal efficiency.
That’s why we can deliver the Nitric Oxide effect of six beets in a concentrated functional food. 
Read more about the science of Nitric Oxide and our team.

Our team of scientists spans food science, nutrition, physiology and kinesiology

Our science leadership team includes the world’s leading Nitric Oxide researcher and one of world’s top most recognized sports nutrition researchers

Our functional foods and supplements are backed by 15 years of research at the University of Texas

We’ve conducted seven clinical trials to-date on our products

Taste Profile
The sweet taste may surprise you.
You don’t need to sacrifice taste for performance. BeetElite comes in Original (with natural apple flavoring) and Black Cherry flavors. Both are refreshing and delicious. So, you can get all of the benefits of this endurance functional food, even if you don’t like the taste of beets. 
We stand behind our products.
We want to bring the very best functional foods and supplements to humans everywhere. So if you’re not completely satisfied with any of our products, you can return them to us within 90 days of your order date, no questions asked.



Directions

Easy to take, easy to drink.
Mix one pack or two scoops of BeetElite with four ounces of cold water and take it for a quick boost 30 minutes before your workout. Each box contains 10 packets and each canister contains 20 servings. 



Nutritional Information

BeetElite Black Cherry Canister Ingredients: Non-GMO Beetroot Powder, Non-GMO Beetroot Powder (fermented), Natural Black Cherry Flavor, Malic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbate and Stevia Leaf Extract.

 
BeetElite Original Canister Ingredients: Non-GMO Beetroot Powder, Non-GMO Beetroot Powder (fermented), Natural Apple Flavor, Malic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbate and Stevia Leaf Extract.




Customer Testimonials

I use this when I have extended workouts (over 2 hours) and it works great on pushing me through without energy failure. It helped way more than expected with endurance and overall energy. Prefer it over any other pre-workout product.
– Steven D. from North Carolina

I recently switched to Beetelite from another product. I chose this product due to taste. I am a competitive cyclist and feel that it gives me an edge in endurance.
– Carly T. from Nebraska

I first used Beetelite for the 2015 LA Marathon in March 2015. I drank it twice for training runs about 10 days before the race with no ill effects, and so I used it on race day and found that my running experience was much better (easier breathing, less fatigue, more endurance) than the four other times I’ve run the LA Marathon in previous years. Also, race recovery was much better than in previous years. Now I use Beet Elite for long training runs and find the same results. I am also a speed skater and use the product before a skate session. My performance is greatly enhanced and I feel great.
– Kristen from California

Carrie Valentin January 27, 2017

Bioperine, Black Pepper, is NOT require to absorb curcumin!!  It can assist but is not required.  I cannot take Bioperine, Black Pepper,  because it interferes with psychiatric medications that I take for Bi-Polar.

The Company
 

Our research on Nitric Oxide first began with the discovery of its unique impact on cardiovascular health. Its immense importance as a biological signaling molecule resulted in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 1998. Realizing that the discovery of Nitric Oxide had immense potential, it didn’t take long for our interest in N-O to become our passion. 
Dr. Nathan Bryan, our Chief Science Officer and co-founder, has committed his life’s work to the field of N-O research. By partnering with leading N-O discovery programs, such as the University of Texas Health Science Center, Dr. Bryan has identified and continues to identify ways to replenish the body’s N-O, and even help the body to promote optimal N-O function.

Ready to bring N-O to the masses, Dr. Bryan co-founded Neogenis Laboratories, now HumanN, in 2009. Consulting with the top N-O scientists, doctors, registered dietitians, and healthcare thought-leaders, there is no other company more committed, or qualified, to bringing the best N-O functional foods and supplements to every human across every phase of life.

Recovery: Tools of the Trade 


 
This year, I have had a little more time then I used to. While perhaps that has meant an increase in milage by about 5%, what the extra time has really been critical for is to learn to utilize RECOVERY to help me be prepared to workout harder and gain those small improvements. At this stage, the hope is to improve by seconds, percentage points, not leaps and bounds. Thankfully, I have been so lucky to learn about and be supported by a few AMAZING brands that deserve a shout – out here.


Roll Recovery: Made my runners and athletes, these tools are fantastic as a means of self maintenance and massage before and after runs and especially hard efforts. The R3 roller is fabulous for plantar, a problem I struggled with in a major way all last year. In addition, the R8 roller is perfect for getting those muscles that stick (like IT Bands and calves for me!) to loosen up a bit and relax after you put them through a hard effort. Moreover, they are killing it with this classy mat that makes pre and post run stretching and prep a lot more stylish and comfy.
Cheribundi: I love tart cherry juice and have become obsessed with this brand for a few years now. These perfect sized bottles come in three types, regular, recovery, and relax. Personally, I use the recovery post workout to have some quick protein and have the relax at night as it helps me get to bed. It is even replaced my favorite, red wine, at times ! Now that is a high compliment.
Enduropacks: Made my triathletes who understand the rigors of intense training, this product has been a new addition to my line up and made a huge difference in my opinion. I truly feel more recovered than ever. First off, their pack consists of a daily multivitamin in the morning, an electrolyte spray that I can spritz right into my water bottle or even just straight into my mouth to gain some quick electrolytes, and then a recovery patch with amino acids I use after hard workout days. There are also glutamine pills for the evening that just aid in sleep in recovery. There is nothing better that products created by people who have been there and saw the need for something. I highly recommend giving them a shot, especially if you, like me, need a one stop shop for the vitamins and right stuff an athlete’s body needs!
Beet Elite: I started trying Beet Elite powder with a bit of water right before my hardest sessions and have not stopped since. As someone who hates beets, the new runner food to many, this product helps give me the boost and nitric oxide that is so good for runners but in a tastier form that I can enjoy. Mainly, it helps me feel ready to take on those hard, fast, lactic acid inducing sessions without fear!

                               
In addition, USATF has partnered with other companies who have made a big difference in the little things that are really big things. First HelloFresh has helped make healthy good meals affordable for my budget. Eating the right stuff shouldn’t be excusable for any reason. It is also fun to have so many new exciting recipes! Second, getting my very own Normatec has been amazing! Not only is it so fun for my non-runner friends and family to watch it work, but it really helps my legs feel as if I have gotten a message or ice bath after 10-15 minutes in the boots. For me, having an attachment for my hips has also really helped me with hurdle workouts and soreness.
So – THANK YOU guys for helping me be a better athlete and more prepared for the tough races ahead.

We stand on the shoulders of giants
to bring Nitric Oxide to the world.






Science is at the core of our company. And our products. 
 
Building on the 1998 Nobel prize-winning research and Nitric Oxide research studies that have since followed, HumanN’s Dr. Nathan Bryan was recruited by the Nobel Laureate to work in the N-O Discovery Program at the University of Texas. 
It was through this program that Dr. Bryan discovered a safe and natural way to get the body to restore its N-O function. Wanting to bring this technology to the masses, he co-founded Neogenis Laboratories, now HumanN, in 2009.
Dr. Bryan, one of today’s most recognized experts in Nitric Oxide research, is credited with a number of significant discoveries in Nitric Oxide function and metabolism. He has been published extensively in the field and holds nine patents or patents pending related to Nitric Oxide.
As the company expanded its Nitric Oxide reach into sports nutrition, renowned Dr. John Ivy joined the company as
 
Executive Director of Sport & Nutrition Research. Dr. Ivy is considered one of the world’s leading scientists in the areas of sports nutrition and protein synthesis, authoring over 170 scientific papers and several books, including the well-known and respected Nutrient Timing: The Future of Sports Nutrition. Working with notable sports greats, including Michael Phelps during his training for the 2012 Summer Olympics, his contributions to sports nutrition and science are unparalleled. 
Today, Dr. Bryan and Dr. Ivy are joined by HumanN’s Scientific Advisory Board, comprised of an impressive team of scientists across a range of disciplines.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
