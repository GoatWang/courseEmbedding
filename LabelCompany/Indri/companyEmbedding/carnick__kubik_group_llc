AllianceBernstein LP


                  AllianceBernstein offers a comprehensive range of investment services across regions and along the risk/return spectrum including: (1) style-pure growth equities and value equities (2) style blend equities (3) fixed-income (4) index and structured services (5) alternative investments and (6) customized and packaged multi-asset class products.AllianceBernstein's value equity strategies seek to deliver superior returns through investments in stocks that are priced below their long-term earnings power, as forecasted by the firm's in-house analysts. The firm looks for stocks that are mispriced relative to the company's long-term prospects and seek to capitalize on improvements in the company's stock price as its earnings recover and the market's anxiety fades. They offer global, regional and single-country value investment strategies, in both developed and developing markets. In select areas, AllianceBernstein offers a variety of value services including a more diversified portfolio with more modest risk and reward targets and deep-value services that focus on maximizing premiums with minimal risk constraints.AllianceBernstein's growth investment strategies employ internal bottom-up research to identify companies with powerful competitive advantages, strong business franchises, growing markets and exceptional management teams. The firm looks for companies with stock prices that seemingly understate their potential. They invest in companies they believe are capable of consistently exceeding consensus expectations.AllianceBernstein has the capability of building growth portfolios in virtually any combination of developed or emerging markets. The firm's growth equity investment philosophy is based on style purity. They look for companies that are growing rapidly, and then focus on companies that are well-positioned to surprise the market on the upside.AllianceBernstein's blend investment strategies combine growth and value portfolios on a 50/50 basis and employ a disciplined rebalancing process. The firm combines style-pure services to create active style-blend equity products that offer strong excess return potential from active management, with less expected risk than is typical for active portfolios with comparable return objectives. Portfolios offer greater expected return for risk by combining style-pure portfolios with negatively correlated or very weakly correlated premiums.In addition, AllianceBernstein offers a broad range of fixed-income investment strategies including global, regional, multi-sector and single-sector.The firm's Index funds seek performance that is in line with a standard benchmark. They offer Index and Enhanced funds that are managed across a wide range of indices, covering various styles, market sizes and regions.AllianceBernstein offers single-alpha and multi-alpha alternative investments to provide clients with a wide range of potential investment solutions. The firm's hedge funds are an extension of their core long-only services. Their multi-alpha hedge funds seek an attractive balance of risk and return by combining several long/short strategies and sources of return with different performance patterns in a single portfolio.Though not limited by sector, AllianceBernstein tends to invest in the stocks of mid-cap and large-cap companies in the finance, electronic technology, producer manufacturing, energy minerals and healthcare technology sectors. The firm maintains a medium turnover rate.
