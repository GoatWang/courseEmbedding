Why Don't Diets Work? CBT's Judith Beck Has the Answer


            A Five-Step Process for Mastering Dieting Skills
        

Judith Beck • 9/27/2016
        

Judith Beck - Why is it so hard to stick to a healthy eating plan and a reasonable exercise regimen? From the viewpoint of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the reason isn't hard to find: knowing what to do and knowing how to get yourself to do it are entirely separate skills. When it comes to changing behavior, especially long-term, habitual patterns, getting yourself to do something different, even when you know it's good for you, depends largely on what you tell yourself: that is, on your thinking.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and the Therapeutic Alliance


            Judith Beck Explains Why CBT Isn't as Manualized as You Might Think
        

Judith Beck, Mary Sykes Wylie • 8/25/2016
        

By Mary Sykes Wylie and Judith Beck - Today, cognitive behavioral therapy is among the most widely practiced and promulgated approach in the world. But for all its mantle of scientific rigor and official approval, many therapists find CBT's "lab therapy" hard to love, if not downright dislikable. In the following interview, renowned CBT clinician Judith Beck explains how the method works, and why it's gotten a bum rap.

A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Solution for Losing Weight


            Judith Beck on Why CBT Could Be Your Best Weight Loss Strategy
        

Judith Beck • 8/11/2015
        

            Why is it so difficult to lose weight and keep it off? From the viewpoint of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the reason isn’t hard to find: knowing what to do and knowing how to get yourself to do it are entirely separate skills. When it comes to changing behavior, especially long-term, habitual patterns, getting yourself to do something different, even when you know it’s good for you, depends largely on what you tell yourself: that is, on your thinking. Outlined here is a program I’ve developed for nonpsychiatric (and noneating-disordered) individuals that utilizes the basic principles of CBT to address overeating directly.

The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Approach to Overcoming Depression


            Judith Beck Explains Her Method of Depression Treatment
        

Judith Beck • 1/16/2015
        

            The hallmark of cognitive therapy is understanding clients’ reactions—emotional and behavioral—in terms of how they interpret situations. The repeated themes in people’s thinking and behavior finally make sense once we understand the basic way they view themselves, their world, and other people. But cognitive therapy goes beyond helping people understand their thoughts and behaviors in sessions. People actually get better by making small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. As therapy progresses, homework assignments and relapse prevention become essential parts of the approach.

The Power of Small Changes


            A Step-by-Step Approach to Treating Depression: An Interview with Judith Beck
        

Judith Beck • 11/12/2014
        

            Relapse prevention begins in the first session, when we tell clients that we want to help them become their own therapists.

I Think, Therefore I Eat


            Skills for Successful Dieting

            From the viewpoint of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, the reason that dieters so frequently fail to stick to their healthy eating plans is simple: knowing what to do and knowing how to get yourself to do it are two entirely different skills.

Why Don't Diets Work? CBT's Judith Beck Has the Answer


            A Five-Step Process for Mastering Dieting Skills
        

Judith Beck • 9/27/2016
        

Judith Beck - Why is it so hard to stick to a healthy eating plan and a reasonable exercise regimen? From the viewpoint of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the reason isn't hard to find: knowing what to do and knowing how to get yourself to do it are entirely separate skills. When it comes to changing behavior, especially long-term, habitual patterns, getting yourself to do something different, even when you know it's good for you, depends largely on what you tell yourself: that is, on your thinking.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and the Therapeutic Alliance


            Judith Beck Explains Why CBT Isn't as Manualized as You Might Think
        

Judith Beck, Mary Sykes Wylie • 8/25/2016
        

By Mary Sykes Wylie and Judith Beck - Today, cognitive behavioral therapy is among the most widely practiced and promulgated approach in the world. But for all its mantle of scientific rigor and official approval, many therapists find CBT's "lab therapy" hard to love, if not downright dislikable. In the following interview, renowned CBT clinician Judith Beck explains how the method works, and why it's gotten a bum rap.

A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Solution for Losing Weight


            Judith Beck on Why CBT Could Be Your Best Weight Loss Strategy
        

Judith Beck • 8/11/2015
        

            Why is it so difficult to lose weight and keep it off? From the viewpoint of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the reason isn’t hard to find: knowing what to do and knowing how to get yourself to do it are entirely separate skills. When it comes to changing behavior, especially long-term, habitual patterns, getting yourself to do something different, even when you know it’s good for you, depends largely on what you tell yourself: that is, on your thinking. Outlined here is a program I’ve developed for nonpsychiatric (and noneating-disordered) individuals that utilizes the basic principles of CBT to address overeating directly.

The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Approach to Overcoming Depression


            Judith Beck Explains Her Method of Depression Treatment
        

Judith Beck • 1/16/2015
        

            The hallmark of cognitive therapy is understanding clients’ reactions—emotional and behavioral—in terms of how they interpret situations. The repeated themes in people’s thinking and behavior finally make sense once we understand the basic way they view themselves, their world, and other people. But cognitive therapy goes beyond helping people understand their thoughts and behaviors in sessions. People actually get better by making small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. As therapy progresses, homework assignments and relapse prevention become essential parts of the approach.

Experience
Vivid Seats

Going to watch your favorite team, band, or show can create memories that will last a lifetime… but finding and buying your tickets can be frustrating and costly. That's why we created Vivid Seats - to give you the best seats in the house with the best value in the industry. Go ahead… live large AND spend less.






















All Access Selection
It all starts with finding the tickets, and Vivid Seats has the top relationships in the industry. When it matters most—for the biggest and hottest events—no one can beat Vivid Seats' selection. We work hard to find the best seat choices at the lowest prices. From a front-row 'dream seat' to an affordable 'just get me in' upper balcony, we have choices for whatever fits your needs and your budget.




VIP Service
Ever notice how the service is always better in the VIP areas? Well, that's our approach for all our customers! We have the most responsive sales and customer service center in the industry; we handle any and all of your concerns from start-to-finish; and we never force you to track down the seller if you have a question. We pledge to work vigorously on your behalf so you can focus on getting excited for your event and not worry about your order. Please call us anytime at 844.339.4289!




Backstage Security
Vivid Seats is the safest, most secure site to purchase live event tickets in the industry. Many other ticketing sites pass along your credit card information to whoever is selling the tickets—but not us! We believe your personal information should stay private and secure. We follow best-in-class web security protocols, and back all your purchases with our 100% Buyer Guarantee: you will safely and securely get the authentic tickets you ordered, on-time, and supported by our dedicated and helpful in-house customer service team.




Rockstar Savings
We know the right tickets to your favorite event can be expensive, which is why we keep our prices as low as possible. We invest heavily in technology and automation, all to keep costs down and pass the savings on to you. No other full-service provider offers the affordability that we do, making us the clear value leader in the industry. Buy with us and bring a larger group, save enough to pay for souvenirs, or just sit closer for your dollar. So, stop shopping around—discover Vivid Seats and get the best value in tickets!

About Us
More than tickets, Vivid Seats…




















Vivid Seats was created out of a genuine love for attending live events…
We all feel the anticipation right after the lights go down. We remember the sounds of the orchestra pit tuning their instruments to deliver enchanting musical scores and standing ovations. We remember the blazing guitar solos, the last second scores, the come-from-behind wins, and the cheers of the fans. It's no accident we're named Vivid Seats…"vivid" comes from the Latin word "vivere" which means "to live"…and going to live events gives you the chance to live the music, live the culture, and live the glory that all generate the vivid memories and unique stories that will last a lifetime! 
Our Purpose
We know that the live event experience starts long before you step into the venue. From the moment you learn about the event, you start figuring out if you can go, who you want to go with, and where you want to sit. Those decisions are all part of what can make the experience great… or, on the other hand, a frustrating hassle. With this in mind, we created Vivid Seats to reinvent the ticket purchasing experience. We have the best tools in the industry for you to learn, shop, share, plan, and organize your live event experience. We continually invest in our site's functionality and information so that you can go from start-to-finish faster and easier than on any other ticket website. And we've worked hard to be the leader in providing value, uniquely combining discount prices with premium service. Simply put, we want you to be able to go to as many live events as possible, and we want to provide the best experience in the industry!
Our Guarantee
We also know that buying tickets requires trust—nobody wants to get ripped off and no one wants to worry about their tickets. That's why we designed our site to be the safest, most secure way to buy tickets online. We never pass along your personal information to the seller, and we back all orders with our 100% Buyer Guarantee. While many of our competitors let just about anyone sell a ticket without sticking around to help, our service covers the rigorous screening process we apply to all the sellers on our website and supports our dedicated, in-house customer service team. We are there to protect and help you all along the way. We invest in the process and infrastructure so that you can purchase tickets worry-free. 
 Our Commitment
We are committed to earning your satisfaction with every order. We have the most responsive customer service team in the industry with decades of professional experience satisfying our thousands of loyal customers and corporate clients. We are here to help you from start to finish…any time…all the time. Getting the right seats at the right price in a fast-moving market requires skilled, efficient, professional coordination. Our full service staff is there to do just that—fully dedicated to giving you the best ticket buying experience in the industry!
As the gateway to your spectacular and memorable live event experiences, we want you to look forward to your upcoming concert, show, or game with confidence, peace of mind, and genuine happiness and excitement, every step of the way. Vivid Seats is your ticket to live events!
Jerry and Eric, Founders
