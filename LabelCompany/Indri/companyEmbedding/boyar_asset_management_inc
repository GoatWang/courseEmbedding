Welcome


Mark Boyar began publishing independent equity research on intrinsically undervalued companies in 1975, which led to the establishment of Boyar Asset Management, a Registered Investment Advisor, in 1983. True to Mark’s vision, Boyar Asset Management focuses on investing in the equity securities of intrinsically undervalued companies.
We define intrinsic value as the amount that would be paid to stockholders if a business were liquidated or sold.
Boyar Asset Management evaluates a corporation in the same manner as a mergers and acquisition specialist would. Our analysis of financial statements is driven by economic reality, not generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
We believe that if we purchase assets at significant discounts to their intrinsic or private market value, over a reasonable period of time the stock market will either reflect the true higher value of those assets or our clients may profit when the assets are acquired by a third party.

Mark Boyar



Mark Boyar
President of Boyar Asset Management
P. 212.995.8300
F. 212.995.5636
Mark A. Boyar, President of Boyar Asset Management, Inc. a Registered Investment Adviser has worked as a securities analyst since 1968. He began actively managing money in 1975 and formed Boyar Asset Management in 1983. In October 1987 a group headed by Mark A. Boyar acquired control of American Corporate Ltd., a closed end fund listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange, which was trading at a deep discount to its net asset value. Five years later he liquidated the fund at a premium to net asset value. In May 1998, Mr. Boyar launched his first mutual fund, The Boyar Value Fund (BOYAX). In addition, Mr. Boyar has published a monthly research report since 1975 entitled Asset Analysis Focus (AAF). This publication (which is currently published by Boyar’s Intrinsic Value Research LLC.) identifies and evaluates companies Mr. Boyar feels are intrinsically undervalued.
As a successful money manager and the publisher of AAF, Mr. Boyar is interviewed and quoted regularly in such publications as Barron’s, Business Week, Financial World, Forbes, Money Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The International Herald Tribune, and The New York Times. He has also appeared numerous times on the CNBC television network, and was a guest on Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser.
Mr. Boyar speaks frequently on the valuation of corporate assets as well as on stock selection. He has spoken at the Cleveland and Milwaukee Societies of Security Analysts, the Chase Exchange, the SIRE Club, the Ceil Walzer Memorial Lecture Series at The New School for Social Research, The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, Inc., Annual Investment Conference, and The New York Bankers Association among others. He also taught a course on mergers and acquisitions at The New School for Social Research.
Before coming to Wall Street, Mr. Boyar was employed on the audit staff of Price-Waterhouse. He earned a B.S. degree from C.W. Post College of Long Island University in June 1968, and attended Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts. Since 1970, he has been a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Federation of Financial Analysts.
Mark Boyar is a Trustee of Long Island University, was formerly Chairman of its Investment Committee and currently sits on that Committee, which has sole responsibility for selecting investment advisors that manage the University’s Endowment.
