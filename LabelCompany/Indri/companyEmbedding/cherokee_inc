History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1973, James Argyropoulos, the son of a Greek immigrant, launched custom-made footwear designs and began to sell them from his Venice Beach, California home. Soon it was stocked by department stores, including Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
In the early 1980s, the brand expanded to selling women's and children's apparel. During this time, it became available worldwide.
In the 1990s, Cherokee established a partnership with Target.[2]
Filing for bankruptcy protection[edit]
It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in both 1993 and 1994, but continued to trade.
Expansion[edit]
In 1997, it acquired Sideout.
From 2002, Cherokee was sold at Tesco in the United Kingdom until 2015, when Argos took over the rights to sell the brand.[3] However, following the 2016 acquisition of Argos by the UK retailer Sainsbury's, the Cherokee brand was quietly dropped and replaced by Sainsbury's own Tu brand of clothing in 2017.
In December 2002, the company further expanded by acquiring the Carole Little, Saint Tropez, All That Jazz and Chorus Line brands and trademarks.
From 2011 to 2015 Cherokee was sold at Target Canada stores and now acquired by Sears Canada. Prior to Target, the label was sold by Zellers in Canada since 1998.
In January 2014, Cherokee acquired the worldwide Tony Hawk and Hawk signature apparel brands. In May 2015, Cherokee acquired casual lifestyle brand Everyday California.
On September 10, 2015, Cherokee announced[4] Target would cease carrying the brand when its license expires on January 31, 2017.
In October 2015, Cherokee acquired Flip Flop Shops, a leading franchise retail chain dedicated to offering the hottest brands and latest styles of flip flops, casual footwear and accessories. In November 2016, Cherokee acquired the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands.

Cherokee's stock plunges toward 20-year low after surprise loss, credit facility discussions
Shares of Cherokee Inc.  plummeted 25% toward a 20-year low in premarket trade Friday, after the marketing and fashion brands company reported a surprise fiscal first-quarter loss. Separately, the company said it had failed to comply with certain covenants in the Cerberus credit facility, but Cerberus agreed to not exercise its rights or remedies under the facilities agreements through July 7. Cherokee said it was in "advanced discussions" with Cerberus to amend the facility, but if an amendment agreement can't be reached, Cerberus will have the right to accelerate the debt. The company, which brands include Tony Hawk, Hi-Tec and Sideout, reported late Thursday a net loss of $3.3 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.6 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss per share was 7 cents, missing the FactSet consensus for a per-share profit of 13 cents. Total revenue rose to $11.1 million from $10.7 million, while royalty revenue fell to $6.8 million from $10.7 million. The stock has tumbled 26% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.6%.

Cherokee's stock plunges toward 20-year low after surprise loss, credit facility discussions
Shares of Cherokee Inc.  plummeted 25% toward a 20-year low in premarket trade Friday, after the marketing and fashion brands company reported a surprise fiscal first-quarter loss. Separately, the company said it had failed to comply with certain covenants in the Cerberus credit facility, but Cerberus agreed to not exercise its rights or remedies under the facilities agreements through July 7. Cherokee said it was in "advanced discussions" with Cerberus to amend the facility, but if an amendment agreement can't be reached, Cerberus will have the right to accelerate the debt. The company, which brands include Tony Hawk, Hi-Tec and Sideout, reported late Thursday a net loss of $3.3 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.6 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss per share was 7 cents, missing the FactSet consensus for a per-share profit of 13 cents. Total revenue rose to $11.1 million from $10.7 million, while royalty revenue fell to $6.8 million from $10.7 million. The stock has tumbled 26% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.6%.

Cherokee Wood Products

Doing Business the Green WayIn the fast changing global economy environmental concerns are at the forefront and at Cherokee we value our role as stewards of our environment and its resources. We believe that “green” business is good business and our policies and actions reflect that.

California Air Resource Board
In 2009 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) enacted new air quality regulations for formaldehyde emissions in composite decorative panels, including particle board, medium density fiberboard (MDF), and hardwood plywood. All of Cherokee’s inbound shipments of these products meet or exceed these new regulations and our future purchases will meet these changing standards as they require lower emission levels in the future.

Certified FSC Chain of CustodyAdditionally, Cherokee is also “Chain of Custody” certified by the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC) to purchase and distribute forest products that carry the FSC® stamp of approval. These products allow our customers to gain LEED credits for their projects through the U.S Green Building Council. We stock a number of these certified items for prompt shipment and other products can be purchased on a special order basis and shipped in a reasonable amount of time. For more information on FSC certified products and the LEED program please contact us or ask your Cherokee Sales Representative. More FSC® product info. is also available at www.fsc.org. Our licence number is FSC-C010564. You can learn more about gaining LEED credits for your project at www.usgbc.org.

Keep your child happy and secure with health and safety suppliesBabies are delicate, vulnerable little people who need constant assistance from the grownups in their lives. Luckily, keeping your little bundle of joy healthy, happy and safe has never been easier. Walmart carries a range of healthcare, monitoring and security products that give parents peace of mind and make the task of keeping an eye on your little one simple and effective. With options ranging from personal care products such as lotions to emergency medical supplies such as thermometers and a range of different tech tools for monitoring, our Every Day Low Prices make it possible for you to stock up on the supplies you need to make your life with baby peaceful and smooth.Health and safety essentialsIf you're a new parent, you may be a little overwhelmed by the range of options in the Walmart Baby Health and Safety department. Don't worry; we're here to help. By breaking the department as a whole up into smaller product-focused sections, you can make it easier to find exactly what you need and identify the products that work best for your budget and lifestyle.Baby grooming and healthcareBabies have delicate skin and sensitive eyes, and they require gentler personal care products than kids and adults use. From baby shampoo that's gentle on the eyes to specially formulated lotions that keep your baby's skin from getting too dry, this product category helps you cover all your personal-care bases to keep your baby clean, soft and dry. This is also the section where you'll find healthcare essentials. Just as babies need specially formulated soaps and lotions, they also require special dosages of medications. Don't give your baby adult formulations of over-the-counter medications like Tylenol. Stick with baby formulas and follow recommended dosages on the bottles for everything from gas-relieving medications to pain and fever relief. This section also has specially designed tools like thermometers and nasal aspirators to help you keep track of your baby's illness and relieve issues like nasal congestion. Babies can't blow their own noses, so nasal aspirators are an important tool to keep on hand just in case your little one gets a stuffy nose. Other grooming- and health-related supplies designed specially for babies, like first aid kits, teething toys, bumpers for sharp corners and bath thermometers, are available in this section.Baby gates and babyproofingNewborn infants aren't too difficult to keep track of they aren't going to move without your help. But with each passing week, babies get more crafty about moving around on their own and finding new ways to cause mischief without even realizing it. You can keep your baby safe and save the contents of your cabinets from getting an infant-spurred reorganization with the equipment in our Baby Gates and Babyproofing sections. If you have pets or older children, baby gates can be helpful right from day one of bringing your baby home from the hospital. These simple gates let you set up temporary barriers in your home to block off space and make hazards like staircases inaccessible to little ones. You can pen your baby into an area larger than a playpen or crib to allow some freedom while also placing limits on access. Similarly, babyproofing supplies let you prevent access to rooms, windows, cabinets and other potential hazards. Shopping for your babyproofing supplies before you bring your little one home can make it easier to get this protective gear in place when you actually need it. You can prevent your baby from fiddling with electrical outlets, toilet seat lids and other household fixtures with the supplies in this section.Baby MonitorsBaby monitors are a high-tech way of making sure your baby stays comfortable and quiet at night or during naptime in the middle of the day. Our Baby Monitors section includes all the latest technology, giving you the ability to hear and see your baby. With so many trusted brands on offer, you can pick and choose from the available options to find the most reliable, highest-quality baby monitor money can buy. While you can still find the classic two-way radio baby monitor style that provides audio feedback from your baby's room, you can also invest in a webcam-style baby monitor to allow family members and other loved ones to peek into your baby's nursery from across the globe. This can also allow parents at work to check in on the baby and give nervous new moms and dads the ability to leave their infant with a babysitter and still stay plugged in to what's going on at home. Visual baby monitors can even be useful while you're inside the house; in addition to hearing whether your baby is fussing, you'll be able to see whether there are any potential hazards in the crib or determine whether your baby is asleep or peacefully awake by just glancing at your monitor.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384875, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

A shopping list is definitely a must, as it can help you keep track of the baby supplies you've already purchased and the stuff you still need. From big purchases like nursery furniture and bottle-feeding equipment to smaller items like diapers and burp cloths, you can find everything you need for your new baby at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart. Here are some essentials to stock up on. Nursery furniture and bedding Crib and mattress: You might opt to purchase a crib right away, or you might want to use a bassinet to bring your newborn closer to your bed instead. No matter what you choose, look for a comfortable sleeping solution for your little one   sleep is extremely important at this stage. Convertible cribs are an economical solution because you can easily convert them into toddler beds and use them for a couple of years after your little one starts growing up. Bedding:  Opt for a waterproof crib mattress pad whenever possible to make your job easier with cleaning. Your baby will need a several fitted crib sheets and some soft blankets. In the first months, babies don't actually need any pillows, but having several sheet sets on hand makes it easier to keep things fresh and limit how often you have to do laundry. High chair and changing unit: A freestanding high chair or a portable one that attaches to a regular chair is ideal for the time when your baby becomes ready for solid food. A changing unit can also make your life so much easier by providing lots of handy storage while looking great in the nursery. Safety gear for baby-proofing As soon as your baby starts crawling and rolling, you need to guard them from numerous household dangers by childproofing your home. Children are curious about the world around them but aren't aware of things that might pose safety hazards, so it's up to you to make sure there aren't any around the house. Some of the essential pieces of safety equipment that you can use to protect your baby from common hazards include safety gates for the top and bottom of the stairs, outlet covers for all the exposed outlets in the house, toilet seat locks, and cupboard and drawer latches.  Baby monitors These handy gadgets come with a transmitter and one or more receivers to allow you to keep an eye on your baby without having to be in the same room with them. You can opt for a model with or without video capabilities. It's always a good idea to purchase a baby monitor with a sound-activated light on the receiver unit so you don't miss your little one crying when you're vacuuming or cooking. Our selection of digital audio or video monitors has something suitable for every house and budget. Baby soothers and toys  Your baby will enjoy soothing and entertainment from the first weeks of life through several years. At Walmart, we have a large selection of baby toys and entertainment items that'll help your little one interact with their environment. Pacifiers: Pacifiers are baby essentials that are designed to both comfort and entertain your little one. Even though not all babies like pacifiers, they're a handy item to have on you when leaving the house. Toys: Babies don't need a lot of toys, but they often become attached to a few favorites. Our selection of soft toys, musical toys and rattles means that you can easily find something for your little one to love that's also engaging. Bouncy seats:  Bouncy seats are highly entertaining for babies because they bounce up and down when your child moves or kicks. They're a safe place to put the baby down for soothing, too, because most babies love the motion. Bathing essentials for babies  Bath time is an important part of the day for babies, so it's a good idea to have the essentials for this area even before you bring your little one home. Opt for a baby tub that's sturdy and well-made. Also, look for baby towels that are soft and large enough to wrap up your baby. Look for no-tears formulas when it comes to soap and shampoo to protect your child's eyes during the bath. Wash cloths are another essential that you may find useful to keep the baby from sliding around in the tub when you place them in.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384887, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-      Finding you the best deals on: Cherokee Inc                     Auto parts Automotive Parts | Bizrate                                          Suggestions        shop by categories            Appliances Automotive Babies & Kids Books & Magazines Clothing & Accessories  Computers & Software DVDs & Videos Digital Cameras Electronics Furniture  Gifts, Flowers & Food Health & Beauty Home & Garden Jewelry & Watches Laptop Computers  Music Musical Instruments Office Supplies Pet Supplies Sports Equipment  Toys & Games Video Games Women's Shoes  see all categories           Related Searches: less  Related Searches: auto parts gauges, dee zee auto parts more    Related Searches:             Home     › Automotive ›       Automotive Parts          ›     auto parts        You're in Automotive Parts   See Matches in:   Automotive Tires   Motorcycle Parts   Automotive Accessories   Bicycle  Parts & Accessories     Narrow Search Results     Price Range      $   to  $     Update>>          By Type Of Product  Air Intakes  Brakes  Engine  Exhaust  Exterior Accessories  Forced Induction  Interior Accessories  Suspension & Handling   more...
