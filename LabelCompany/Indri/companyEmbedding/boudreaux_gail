Energy Saving Tip

Set your hot water heater to no higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit. This isn't just energy smart—it's also safer, since it reduces the likelihood of accidental burns.











Look Up. Look Out. Stay Safe.

Be very aware of overhead power lines coming into your home. Always keep yourself, your ladders and tools at least 10 feet away.
