Cambrex Corporation is a life sciences company that provides products and services for small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
Cambrex has cGMP manufacturing facilities in the US (Charles City, IA), Europe (Karlskoga, Sweden, Milan, Italy and Hyderabad, India, and R&D centers in Tallinn, Estonia, Wiesbaden, Germany). The headquarters are located in East Rutherford, NJ.
In 2007, Cambrex divested their biologics business to Lonza to focus on small molecule APIs.
History[edit]
Cambrex was founded in 1981, when the CasChem group acquired the castor oil and derivatives product lines from NL Industries. In 1987, CasChem was renamed Cambrex Corporation and became listed on NASDAQ. Cambrex entered the pharmaceutical market in 1994 with the acquisition of Nobel Pharma Chemistry business, now known as Cambrex Karlskoga AB and Cambrex Profarmaco.
Through multiple acquisitions during the late 1990s, the firm entered the bioscience and the chiral enzymatic catalyst markets. In 1998, Cambrex was listed on the NYSE. The firm acquired two contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, in 2001, to bulk manufacture biologics and pharmaceutical ingredients from clinical to commercial scales. In 2007, the firm decided to focus on its core competencies and sold the biologics business to Lonza Group. In 2008, Prosyntest (now Cambrex Tallinn) was acquired, and Steve Klosk was appointed CEO, while remaining President. To broaden their biocatalysis platform, Cambrex acquired IEP, now known as Cambrex IEP. In 2014, they acquired Zenara Pharma to enhance its drug product formulation capabilities, including Nicotine Replacement Therapy products.Cambrex Corporation has agreed to acquire Pharma Core Inc, a private company specializing in developing, manufacturing and scaling up small molecule APIs for clinical phase projects, for approx $25 million [1]

Cambrex Corp. has announced the completion of a $50 million expansion of its facilities in Charles City.


SUBMITTED




















































CHARLES CITY — Cambrex Corp. has announced the completion of a $50 million state-of-the-art production and warehousing expansion at its cGMP Charles City site.The investment in capacity and capabilities was made in reflection of strong market demand for small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and high utilization of Cambrex’s existing large scale assets, according to a press release from the company.“There is high demand for U.S.-based suppliers with large scale cGMP contract manufacturing capacity and world class quality systems,” said Steve Klosk, CEO of Cambrex.
“We have invested over $125 million at the Charles City site since we acquired it in 1991,” he said, “and believe that this expansion, combined with a very talented and experienced team, provides an ongoing foundation for our customers’ small molecule product manufacturing needs while supporting our goal of bringing our customers’ products to market quickly.”The new 7,500-square-foot multipurpose manufacturing facility will initially add a total of 70 cubic meters of reactors along with agitated filter dryers to provide a flexible, multi-purpose configuration. The facility complements the three existing large scale manufacturing facilities at the Charles City site.
The 36,000-square-foot cGMP warehouse provides general storage for 2,720 pallets and segregated refrigerated storage for 360 pallet spaces with monitored temperature and humidity controls. The facility employs a barcode system for automated bin location and has a dedicated sampling room with appropriate extraction and handling for flammable materials.
Additionally, a further 7,500-square-foot manufacturing shell has been constructed which will be fitted out to customer specifications.Cambrex’s Charles City facility sits on a 45-acre site and manufactures a wide range of APIs and pharmaceutical intermediates, including highly potent molecules and controlled substances.The facility is one of a limited number authorized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to import narcotic raw materials at commercial scale.For more information, visit www.cambrex.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
