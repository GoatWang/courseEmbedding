Blackstone Alternative Alpha Funds Announce Estimated Year-End 
      Distribution of $30.00 to $55.00 per Share






October 29, 2015 12:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blackstone (NYSE:BX) today announced that the Blackstone Alternative 
      Alpha Fund and the Blackstone Alternative Alpha Fund II (each a “Fund”, 
      and collectively, the “Funds”) they expect to pay a year-end 
      distribution to their shareholders of record on or about December 30, 
      2015. The Funds estimate that the distribution will be in the range of 
      $30.00 to $55.00 per share.
    

      Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund ($1,191.06 as of September 30, 2015), the estimated amount 
      represents a distribution in the range of approximately 2.5% to 4.6% of 
      the value of each share of that Fund.
    

      Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund II, Advisor Class II Shares ($994.79 as of September 30, 2015), the 
      estimated amount represents a distribution in the range of approximately 
      3.0% to 5.5% of the value of each share of that Fund.
    

      Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund II, Advisor Class III Shares ($1,107.07 as of September 30, 2015), 
      the estimated amount represents a distribution in the range of 
      approximately 2.7% to 5.0% of the value of each share of that Fund.
    

      Note that the estimated distribution amount is being provided for 
      informational purposes only; the estimated distribution amount is subject 
      to change and should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Actual 
      distribution amounts are subject to approval by the Funds’ Board of 
      Trustees and will be posted on the Funds’ website (www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds) 
      in December 2015 after the ex-dividend date.
    

      When a Fund makes a distribution, there will be a corresponding decrease 
      in the net asset value of the Fund. However, investors will receive 
      either a cash payment or additional shares of the Fund corresponding to 
      the amount of the distribution depending on an investor’s dividend 
      reinvestment election. All taxable investors of record as of December 
      31, 2015 will have to include the distribution in 2015 taxable income.

      assumptions; actual distribution amounts will be announced after the 
      record date and may vary substantially from the above estimate. 
      Variations between the estimated and actual distribution amounts may 
      arise as a result of portfolio, market, and shareholder activity or tax 
      adjustments. Moreover, since the Funds make investments in underlying 
      domestic and foreign hedge funds, the actual distribution will be based 
      in part on tax information provided by underlying hedge funds, which is 
      not available at this time.

      investment adviser of the Funds, provide tax, accounting or legal

Blackstone Alternative Alpha Funds Announce Estimated Year-End 
      Distribution of $17.00 to $44.00 per Share






























NEW YORK, Oct 28, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Each of Blackstone Alternative Alpha Fund and Blackstone Alternative 
      Alpha Fund II (each a “Fund”, and collectively, the “Funds”) announced 
      today that it expects to pay a year-end distribution to its shareholders 
      of record as of December 29, 2016, or such date as may be determined by 
      the Board of Trustees. The Funds estimate that the distribution will be 
      in the range of $17.00 to $44.00 per share.


                                        








Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund ($1,138.32 as of September 30, 2016), the estimated amount 
      represents a distribution in the range of approximately 1.5% to 3.9% of 
      the value of each share of that Fund.


                                        








Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund II, Advisor Class II Shares ($966.85 as of September 30, 2016), the 
      estimated amount represents a distribution in the range of approximately 
      1.8% to 4.6% of the value of each share of that Fund.


                                        








Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund II, Advisor Class III Shares ($1,080.34 as of September 30, 2016), 
      the estimated amount represents a distribution in the range of 
      approximately 1.6% to 4.1% of the value of each share of that Fund.


                                        








Note that the estimated distribution amount is being provided for 
      informational purposes only; the estimated distribution amount is         subject 
      to change
 and should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Actual 
      distribution amounts are subject to approval by the Funds’ Board of 
      Trustees and will be posted on the Funds’ website (        www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds
) 
      in December 2016 after the ex-dividend date.


                                        








When a Fund makes a distribution, there will be a corresponding decrease 
      in the net asset value of the Fund. However, investors will receive 
      either a cash payment or additional shares of the Fund corresponding to 
      the amount of the distribution depending on an investor’s dividend 
      reinvestment election. All taxable investors of record as of December 
      30, 2016 will have to include the distribution in 2016 taxable income.


                                        








Important Information

                                        








The information contained herein is based on a number of broad 
      assumptions; actual distribution amounts will be announced after the 
      record date and may vary substantially from the above estimate. 
      Variations between the estimated and actual distribution amounts may 
      arise as a result of portfolio, market, and shareholder activity or tax 
      adjustments. Moreover, since the Funds make investments in underlying 
      domestic and foreign hedge funds, the actual distribution will be based 
      in part on tax information provided by underlying hedge funds, which is 
      not available at this time.


                                        








Neither the Funds nor Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P., the 
      investment adviser of the Funds, provide tax, accounting or legal 
      advice. Any tax statements contained herein are not intended or written 
      to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding U.S., 
      federal, state or local tax penalties. Investors should consult their 
      advisor as to any tax, accounting or legal statements made herein. 
      Specific questions regarding an investor’s personal income tax situation 
      should be referred to a tax advisor.


                                        








About Blackstone Alternative Alpha Funds

                                        








Each of the Funds is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment 
      company that is managed by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P., 
      a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P.

. Each Fund’s 
      investment objective is to seek to earn long-term risk-adjusted returns 
      that are attractive as compared to those of traditional public equity 
      and fixed income markets. The Funds pursue their investment objective by 
      investing, indirectly through a master fund, in domestic and foreign 
      hedge funds that employ primarily equity-based investment strategies. 
      There can be no assurance that either Fund will achieve its investment 
      objective. Additional information is available at         www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds
.


                                        


This press release is not an offer to sell the Funds’ securities and 
      is not soliciting an offer to buy the Funds’ securities in any state 
      where the offer or sale is not permitted.        

All investors should 
      consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the 
      Funds before investing.        

The prospectus contains this and other 
      information about the Funds.        

You can obtain a prospectus from 
      your financial professional or from the Funds’ website (        


).        

All investors are urged to carefully read the prospectus in its 
      entirety before investing.        



Performance data quoted above represents past performance and is 
      no guarantee of future results. Investment results will fluctuate so 
      that an investor’s shares, if repurchased in a tender offer, may be 
      worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be 
      higher or lower than performance data quoted. Performance does not 
      include a deduction of the maximum sales charge (up to 3.00%), which 
      would lower the performance shown. Information about the Funds, 
      including current month-end performance, is available at         


.        









An investment in either Fund is an appropriate investment only for those 
      investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a 
      liquid investment. The Fund’s investment program includes investments in 
      hedge funds that may utilize such investment techniques as short sales, 
      substantial leverage, securities lending, investments in non-marketable 
      securities, use of derivatives and highly concentrated portfolios, among 
      others, which could under certain circumstances magnify the impact of 
      any negative market or investment developments. Investments in hedge 
      funds (directly or indirectly through the Funds) are generally subject 
      to less regulation and higher fees than mutual funds, which may offset 
      profits, if any. These fees may include management, distribution, 
      service, and early redemption fees, among others. Please refer to the 
      Funds’ prospectus for additional information on the risks, charges and 
      expenses associated with the Funds.
