Shares of DRD Now Oversold






DRDGold Stock Getting Very Oversold

















DRD Stock Crowded With Sellers
In trading on Tuesday, shares of DRDGold Ltd entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $4.92 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

Sep 27, 2016 12:25 PM EDT













DRD's Strong Dividend History Helps Get It To The Top 5
DRDGold Ltd has been named as a Top 5 dividend paying metals and mining stock, according to Dividend Channel, which published its weekly ''DividendRank'' report. The report noted that among metals and mining companies, DRD shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics.

Sep 26, 2016 7:22 AM EDT













DRDGold is Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. DRDGold Ltd presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

DRD Ex-Dividend Reminder - 11/12/14
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 11/12/14, DRDGold Ltd will trade ex-dividend, for its annual dividend of $0.0182, payable on 11/28/14. As a percentage of DRD's recent stock price of $2.50, this dividend works out to approximately 0.73%, so look for shares of DRDGold Ltd to trade 0.73% lower — all else being equal — when DRD shares open for trading on 11/12/14.

Nov 10, 2014 11:13 AM EST













First Week of DRD February 2015 Options Trading
Investors in DRDGold Ltd saw new options become available this week, for the February 2015 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 151 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Group structure
The company has a simple, efficient structure. All operations are consolidated into one operating entity, Ergo Mining Proprietary Limited (Ergo). Ergo is wholly owned by Ergo Mining Operations Proprietary Limited (EMO). Following the roll-up of the stake of our broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) partners in EMO into DRDGOLD, EMO is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of DRDGOLD. The roll-up involved the substitution by our BBBEE partners, Khumo Gold SPV Proprietary Limited (Khumo) and the DRDSA Empowerment Trust (the Trust) for a direct holding in DRDGOLD. The agreement provided Khumo with an 8.1% interest and the Trust with a 2.4% interest in DRDGOLD. Continue reading...

          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
