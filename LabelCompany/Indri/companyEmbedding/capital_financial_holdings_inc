Client agrees to be bound by all communications (and the consequences thereof) placed on, executed through or facilitated by the Sites that are accompanied by a valid User ID and a valid Access Code assigned to Client or an Authorized Person. Upon becoming aware of, or if Client suspects, a technical failure or any improper access to or use of the Sites or Access Codes by any Authorized Person or other person, Client shall promptly notify Bank of America of such occurrence, and shall, as promptly as practicable, to the extent any improper access or use is by an Authorized Person, take immediate actions to terminate such Authorized Person's access to and use of the Sites. Bank of America reserves the right to limit or terminate Client's or any Authorized Person's access to and use of the Sites immediately and without notice.
NO OFFERS
Unless specifically identified as an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy, under no circumstances should any information on the Sites be used as or considered to be an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy the securities or any other instruments of Bank of America or any other issuer. Offers can only be made where lawful under applicable law. Any information, services, or securities offered via the Sites are intended to be available only to residents of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom. The viewing or distribution of the Sites may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. Persons using the Sites are required to inform themselves about and observe any legal restrictions on the use of the Sites and any restrictions set forth in the Sites. The Sites do not constitute an offer of, or a solicitation to purchase any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation would be unlawful. If you wish to obtain further details about any information contained through the Sites, there are several areas on the Sites that will provide you with contact information.
DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST
Affiliates of Bank of America may make a market or deal as principal in the securities mentioned in these Sites or in options based thereon. In addition, Bank of America or its Affiliates, their shareholders, directors, officers and/or employees, may from time to time have long or short positions in such securities or in options, futures or other derivative instruments based thereon. One or more directors, officers and/or employees of Bank of America or its Affiliates may be a director of the issuer of the securities mentioned at these Sites.

ACCOUNT INFORMATION
Certain information from Client's account(s) at Bank of America or its Affiliates is accessible on the Sites and can be downloaded by Client ("Account Information"). While Bank of America and its Affiliates believe that this Account Information will be accurate at the time of access and/or downloading by Client, this information may have certain technical flaws, typographical errors or other inaccuracies. Additionally, the Account Information is subject to immediate change resulting from market conditions, price fluctuations and other related factors. Bank of America and its Affiliates expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or use of such Account Information upon its being downloaded by Client and will not be liable for any difficulty, damage or inaccessibility of such information due to hardware or software incompatibility.
PRICING AND MARKET INFORMATION
Actual prices can be obtained only on a real-time, expressly agreed-upon basis. Any indicative valuations on the Sites are provided for information only. They are not an offer to enter into, transfer and assign or terminate any transaction, or a commitment by Bank of America or its Affiliates to make such an offer. An indicative valuation may differ substantially from an actual value. Such estimates do not necessarily reflect Bank of America's or its Affiliates' internal bookkeeping or theoretical model-based valuations. Certain factors, which may not have been assessed for purposes of these valuations, including, for example, notional amounts, credit spreads, underlying volatility, costs of carry or use of capital and profit, may substantially affect a stated valuation. Indicative valuations may vary significantly from indicative valuations available from other sources. While Bank of America and its Affiliates have obtained the information on which these evaluations are based from sources they believe are reliable, Bank of America and its Affiliates make no representations or warranties with respect to any indicative valuations. Prior to the execution of a Transaction based upon the Content of these Sites, Client is advised to consult with its broker or other financial representative to verify pricing information.
HYPOTHETICAL OR PAST PERFORMANCE
Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are designed with the benefit of hindsight. Past performance is not indicative of future results; no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
MATERIAL IN ITS ENTIRETY
All materials at these Sites are meant to be reviewed in their entirety, including any footnotes, legal disclaimers, restrictions or disclosures, or any copyright or proprietary notices. Any disclaimers, restrictions, disclosure or hedge clauses apply to any partial document or material in the same manner as they do to the whole, and will be deemed incorporated in the portion of any material or document that you consult or download.
LINKED SITES
Certain hyperlinks on the Sites may link websites maintained by the Affiliates, which are not to be considered a part of the Sites.

From the President















Our core business, the
financial services industry, has been, along with the rest of the business
community, an engrossed audience in the unusual and unpredictable political
atmosphere which began with the Presidential Campaign and continued through the
new days and months of a new President. 
The effect of a new administration is still unknown for our business
although the stock market and business community has shown strength and
resilience so far this year.  Similarly,
our Company has gone through an unusual and unpredictable period of change in
recent months.


As outlined in the
following financial highlights and in our financial reports, the Company
incurred a loss for the 2016 year end. Obviously this is a major concern to be
addressed.  As a fact of business life,
our Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to
potentially significant litigation risks. Issuers of several alternative
products sold by Capital Financial Services, Inc. in the 2007 to 2009 date
range (while the Company’s broker dealer operation was under a former
management group) had financial difficulties and went into receiverships or
otherwise failed. As a result of the failure of those alternative products, the
Company has been subject to arduous, expensive and time consuming legal and/or
arbitration proceedings stemming from that regrettable period for years. On
December 21, 2016, the Company made a settlement payment in the amount of
$200,000 and in December 31, 2016, without admission of liability, the Company
recorded a $63,000 liability, both on matters arising from the 2007-2009 era. In
September of 2016, the Company settled all claims between the Company and its former
liability insurer in exchange for payment by the Company of $82,500, again a
matter relating back to the 2007-2009 era.  The expense of settlements alone for matters
relating back to 2007-2009 cost the Company $355,000 in 2016 and that number
does not include the outside legal fees of defending these suits.  Without these legal settlements and the legal
fees that accompanied them, the Company would have been profitable in 2016.  My goal has been to rid the Company of this
burdensome and incapacitating litigation. The good news is that I believe that during the year ended
December 31, 2016 the last of these ominous matters were settled or resolved
and happily none of our current management team was involved in the decisions
that initiated these problems.  Because
we are in a litigious society and a financial service business, legal liability
will continue, but hopefully at more manageable costs.  In the coming year we will look for innovative
ways to grow, control costs and gain revenues.
 


New Department of Labor
rules currently scheduled to be implemented in stages between June 9 of this
year and January of 2018 will create new requirements and procedures for our
business.  The uncertainty of the pending
regulatory requirements has definitely created anxiety in the financial
services industry and financial services professionals.  A few of our financial service
representatives have chosen to retire rather than learn new rules and
procedures.  We will continue to move
forward with the rest of the industry as required.


In the last quarter of
2016 we purchased an office building about two miles from our current rented
offices. Remodel and upgrades have been in process on the new office facility
since the beginning of 2017.  The new facility
is much more modern and technology friendly than our current facility and
allows room for us to expand both people wise and technologically when
opportunities present themselves. 
Progress on the remodel and preparation of our new Company headquarters
has gone well so far with only limited setbacks and issues with the project. Although
the new building is larger than our current needs, we are considering options
including renting a portion, creating an office condominium and selling a
portion and/or potentially growing into the space over time.  We are anticipating moving into our new facility
in June of 2017 in time for our annual meeting in July.   If you have the opportunity to attend the
annual meeting you are welcome to a tour of the facility as our shareholder
meeting will be held at the new office facility.


Our goal for 2017 is to grow,
generate revenues and profits for our Company and you its shareholders and
build a strong and sustainable dividend stream for the future. 


We are excited to move
forward with new offices, fresh management, renewed energy and optimism.


Best Wishes,







Gordon Dihle


Chief Executive Officer

About Us
Why Choose Capital Financial?
We live and work in a rapidly changing global marketplace. With the amount of technology and the myriad of financial products and services available, investors are seeking personalized attention and expertise. Since 1980, Capital Financial has provided individual and corporate clients with quality investments and professional guidance to assist them in meeting their financial objectives. These services are available through a network of individual registered representatives and investment advisors, some of whom conduct business at financial institutions.
Accomplishing Your Goal…Is Our Goal.
Capital Financial’s representatives have the knowledge and expertise to assist clients in meeting their objectives whether it is growth, income, tax savings or estate conservation.

How Can Capital Financial Guide You?
Capital Financial prides itself in being client focused and service oriented. We believe in building relationships for the long-term. Successful investing and financial planning does not begin or end with purchasing an investment. Depending on each client’s needs, an investment representative can:

Assist you in determining your financial goals.
Review your current savings and investment programs.
Analyze your present tax situation.
Provide you with thorough, thoughtful investment planning.
Provide you with guidance in the selection of quality investments.
Implement your investment decisions.
Assist you in estate planning.
Periodically review your financial goals and investments.

Such disasters might include, but are not limited to fire, tornado, flood, earthquake or chemical spill. The Company’s policy is to respond to disasters by safeguarding employees’ lives and Company property, making a financial and operational assessment, quickly recovering and resuming operations, protecting all of the Company’s books and records, and allowing customers to transact business. The Company has made provisions and has established procedures to ensure the continuance of business within a predetermined “reasonable” period of time.

Client acknowledges and agrees that Client and/or its Authorized Persons may access the Sites through the World Wide Web or other Internet service which is not necessarily secure, and Bank of America does not warrant that such system is secure. Client agrees to be bound by all communications (and the consequences thereof) placed on, executed through or facilitated by the Sites that are accompanied by a valid User ID and a valid Access Code assigned to Client or an Authorized Person. Upon becoming aware of, or if Client suspects, a technical failure or any improper access to or use of the Sites or Access Codes by any Authorized Person or other person, Client shall promptly notify Bank of America of such occurrence, and shall, as promptly as practicable, to the extent any improper access or use is by an Authorized Person, take immediate actions to terminate such Authorized Person's access to and use of the Sites. Bank of America reserves the right to limit or terminate Client's or any Authorized Person's access to and use of the Sites immediately and without notice.
NO OFFERS
Unless specifically identified as an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy, under no circumstances should any information on the Sites be used as or considered to be an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy the securities or any other instruments of Bank of America or any other issuer. Offers can only be made where lawful under applicable law. Any information, services, or securities offered via the Sites are intended to be available only to residents of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom. The viewing or distribution of the Sites may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. Persons using the Sites are required to inform themselves about and observe any legal restrictions on the use of the Sites and any restrictions set forth in the Sites. The Sites do not constitute an offer of, or a solicitation to purchase any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation would be unlawful. If you wish to obtain further details about any information contained through the Sites, there are several areas on the Sites that will provide you with contact information.
DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST
Affiliates of Bank of America may make a market or deal as principal in the securities mentioned in these Sites or in options based thereon. In addition, Bank of America or its Affiliates, their shareholders, directors, officers and/or employees, may from time to time have long or short positions in such securities or in options, futures or other derivative instruments based thereon. One or more directors, officers and/or employees of Bank of America or its Affiliates may be a director of the issuer of the securities mentioned at these Sites.

ACCOUNT INFORMATION
Certain information from Client's account(s) at Bank of America or its Affiliates is accessible on the Sites and can be downloaded by Client ("Account Information").

Bank of America and its Affiliates expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or use of such Account Information upon its being downloaded by Client and will not be liable for any difficulty, damage or inaccessibility of such information due to hardware or software incompatibility.
PRICING AND MARKET INFORMATION
Actual prices can be obtained only on a real-time, expressly agreed-upon basis. Any indicative valuations on the Sites are provided for information only. They are not an offer to enter into, transfer and assign or terminate any transaction, or a commitment by Bank of America or its Affiliates to make such an offer. An indicative valuation may differ substantially from an actual value. Such estimates do not necessarily reflect Bank of America's or its Affiliates' internal bookkeeping or theoretical model-based valuations. Certain factors, which may not have been assessed for purposes of these valuations, including, for example, notional amounts, credit spreads, underlying volatility, costs of carry or use of capital and profit, may substantially affect a stated valuation. Indicative valuations may vary significantly from indicative valuations available from other sources. While Bank of America and its Affiliates have obtained the information on which these evaluations are based from sources they believe are reliable, Bank of America and its Affiliates make no representations or warranties with respect to any indicative valuations. Prior to the execution of a Transaction based upon the Content of these Sites, Client is advised to consult with its broker or other financial representative to verify pricing information.
HYPOTHETICAL OR PAST PERFORMANCE
Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are designed with the benefit of hindsight. Past performance is not indicative of future results; no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
MATERIAL IN ITS ENTIRETY
All materials at these Sites are meant to be reviewed in their entirety, including any footnotes, legal disclaimers, restrictions or disclosures, or any copyright or proprietary notices. Any disclaimers, restrictions, disclosure or hedge clauses apply to any partial document or material in the same manner as they do to the whole, and will be deemed incorporated in the portion of any material or document that you consult or download.
LINKED SITES
Certain hyperlinks on the Sites may link websites maintained by the Affiliates, which are not to be considered a part of the Sites. Certain other links on the Sites to non-affiliated third-party sites may contain information over which we have no control. We take no responsibility for the content, accuracy, content, completeness, timeliness, current value or any aspect of the information on these sites and disclaim any liability to Client for it or for any consequence of your decision to use the links provided or your use of such information.
