We specifically plan to service asset managers, insurance companies, state funds and corporations with a broad base of fixed income products. These products will include cash corporate bonds, credit default swaps, repurchase agreements, structured product and private placements, as well as interest rate products involving Treasuries, Agencies, TIPS and derivatives."
