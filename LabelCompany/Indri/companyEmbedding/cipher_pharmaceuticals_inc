It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

	The following is a discussion and analysis of the operating
	results and financial position of Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Cipher” or “the Company")
	for the period ended March 31, 2016. This document should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed interim consolidated

	.


	 


	The discussion and analysis within this MD&A are as of May
	4, 2016.


	 


	Caution Regarding Forward-Looking
	Statements



	 




	This document includes forward-looking statements within
	the meaning of certain securities laws, including the “safe harbour” provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario) and
	other provincial securities law in Canada and U.S. securities laws. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements
	with respect to our objectives, goals and strategies to achieve those objectives and goals, as well as statements with respect
	to our beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions. The words “may”, “will”,
	“could”, “should”, “would”, “suspect”, “outlook”, “believe”,
	“plan”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “forecast”,
	“objective”, “hope” and “continue” (or the negative thereof), and words and expressions of
	similar import, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.




	 




	By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve
	inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which give rise to the possibility that predictions, forecasts, projections
	and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved. Certain material factors or assumptions are applied in making forward-looking
	statements and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. We caution readers not
	to place undue reliance on these statements as a number of important factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause
	our actual results to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions
	expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to enter into in-licensing,
	development, manufacturing and marketing and distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical companies and keep such agreements
	in effect; our dependency on a limited number of products; integration difficulties and other risks if we acquire or in-license
	technologies or product candidates; reliance on third parties for the marketing of certain products; the product approval process
	is highly unpredictable; the timing of completion of clinical trials; reliance on third parties to manufacture our products; we
	may be subject to product liability claims; unexpected product safety or efficacy concerns may arise; we generate license revenue
	from a limited number of distribution and supply agreements; the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive; requirements for
	additional capital to fund future operations; dependence on key managerial personnel and external collaborators; no assurance that
	we will receive regulatory approvals in the U.S., Canada or any other jurisdictions; certain of our products are subject to regulation
	as controlled substances; limitations on reimbursement in the healthcare industry; limited reimbursement for products by government
	authorities and third-party payor policies; various laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse; reliance on the success of
	strategic investments and partnerships; the publication of negative results of clinical trials; unpredictable development goals
	and projected time frames; rising insurance costs; ability to enforce covenants not to compete; risks associated with the industry
	in which it operates; we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions; we may
	be unable to identify, acquire or integrate acquisition targets successfully; operations in the U.S.; inability to meet covenants
	under our credit facilities; compliance with privacy and security regulation; our policies regarding returns, allowances and chargebacks
	may reduce revenues; certain regulations could restrict our activities; additional regulatory burden and controls over financial
	reporting; reliance on third parties to perform certain services; general commercial litigation, class actions, other litigation
	claims and regulatory actions; being a foreign private issuer may limit the information available to U.S. shareholders; we may
	lose our foreign private issuer status which could result in significant additional costs; the potential violation of intellectual
	property rights of third parties; our efforts to obtain, protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights
	related to our products; changes in U.S., Canadian or foreign patent laws; litigation in the pharmaceutical industry concerning
	the manufacture and supply of novel and generic versions of existing drugs; inability to protect our trademarks from infringement;
	shareholders may be further diluted; volatility of our share price; a significant shareholder; we do not currently intend to pay
	dividends; our operating results may fluctuate significantly; and our debt obligations will have priority over the Common Shares
	in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up.




	 




	We caution that the foregoing list of important factors that
	may affect future results is not exhaustive. When reviewing our forward-looking statements, investors and others should carefully
	consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Additional information about factors that may cause

	Change in presentation currency


	 


	Effective April 1, 2015, we changed our presentation currency
	from the Canadian dollar to the United States dollar. We believe that changing our presentation currency to U.S. dollars will result
	in more relevant and reliable information for our financial statement users, and will more accurately reflect the results of our
	operations. For the period ended March 31, 2015 and for all prior periods, we presented our financial statements in Canadian dollars.
	The comparative figures disclosed in our financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2016, and in this Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis, have been retrospectively changed to reflect the change in presentation currency to the U.S. dollar, as
	if the U.S. dollar had been used as the presentation currency for all prior periods. All dollar figures are stated in U.S. dollars
	unless otherwise indicated.


	 


	Overview


	 


	Cipher (NASDAQ:CPHR; TSX:CPH) is a rapidly growing specialty
	pharmaceutical dermatology company, with a robust and diversified portfolio of commercial and late-stage products. Cipher acquires
	first-in-class or best-in-class products and transformative compounds that fulfill high unmet medical needs. Our experienced management
	team has a proven track record of successfully managing the required clinical development and regulatory approval processes and
	marketing products either directly or through partners. Cipher is well-capitalized to drive sustained earnings growth by leveraging
	our proven clinical development capabilities and efficient commercial execution. With seven transactions announced in 2015 and
	significant regulatory progress, we are on pace to achieve our goal of expanding our Canadian dermatology franchise, building a
	U.S. commercial presence and ultimately, becoming the most customer-centric dermatology company in North America.


	 


	Growth Strategy


	 


	With a mandate to leverage Cipher’s existing core capabilities,
	infrastructure and existing product portfolio (led by a novel version of the acne medication isotretinoin, which is marketed as
	Absorica

	®

	in the U.S. and Epuris

	®

	in Canada), in fiscal 2014 the Company implemented a
	three-pronged growth strategy, enabling its transformation from a royalty revenue company into a pure play dermatology company
	and significantly improving its long-term growth opportunities. The three components of the growth strategy are:


	 







	·



	Building a larger dermatology franchise in Canada through a combination of in-licensing and acquisitions (acquisitions would
	be accretive within two years);











	·



	Acquiring and developing potentially transformative technology that can be commercialized efficiently in North America; and









	·



	Establishing a commercial operation in the U.S. through M&A and build a leading dermatology franchise in that country.




	 


	Cipher completed seven transactions in 2015, acquiring 15 dermatology
	products, the majority of which are either commercial or late-stage pre-commercial, significantly expanding its product portfolio.
	These acquisitions support all three components of Cipher’s growth strategy.


	 


	In January 2015, the Company announced the acquisition of seven
	pre-clinical compounds for the treatment of melanoma and other cancers from Melanovus Oncology, Inc. ("Melanovus"), including
	the related intellectual property from The Penn State Research Foundation. Also in January 2015, we announced that Cipher had acquired
	the commercial rights for the novel antibacterial compound Ozenoxacin for the treatment of impetigo. In March 2015, Cipher licensed
	the Canadian distribution rights to CF101, a novel chemical entity being developed by Can-Fite Biopharma (“Can-Fite”)
	for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.


	 


	In Q1 2015, Cipher acquired the worldwide rights to three products
	from Astion Pharma, a Denmark-based specialty pharmaceutical. We believe the three products, namely Dermadexin™, Pruridexin™,
	and ASF-1096, will strengthen Cipher’s dermatology product pipeline and, if approved, would present a sizable market opportunity.


	 


	In May 2015, we acquired the Canadian rights to Vaniqa

	®

	 and
	Actikerall

	®

	 from Almirall S.A, a Spanish pharmaceutical company.  Both products had already been approved
	by Health Canada. Cipher began marketing Vaniqa on the Canadian market in May 2015 and Actikerall was launched in February 2016.


	 


	In April 2015, we delivered on our strategic priority of establishing
	a U.S. commercial sales and marketing capabilities through the acquisition of Innocutis Holdings, LLC (“Innocutis”),
	a privately-held U.S. dermatology company. In addition to acquiring Innocutis’ nine branded dermatology products, led by
	Sitavig, a breakthrough treatment for cold sores launched in the U.S. in Q3 2014 with significant upside sales potential, Cipher
	plans to leverage the U.S. sales platform to launch its other products into the U.S. market. Cipher has developed and is implementing
	an aggressive sales and marketing program to reverse the business decline and to

	Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc.  

	2016 First Quarter Report







	 




	 





	 




	 


	accelerate the growth and maximize the potential sales of Sitavig
	and Nuvail in the U.S. In addition, in January 2016 we launched Bionect Foam in the U.S.


	 


	Looking ahead, we plan to continue on this growth trajectory
	as we focus on investing in the short-term to maximise the potential of our existing products, while at the same time, identifying
	opportunities to acquire additional late stage dermatology products to further strengthen our existing product portfolio. We will
	also continue to leverage our regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Canada to pursue licensing agreements in other markets, where
	economically viable.


	 


	Acquisition of Innocutis and Debt Facility


	 



	On April 13,
	2015, Cipher announced its U.S. commercial entry through the acquisition of Innocutis. Consideration for the acquisition was $45.5
	million. The agreement includes additional Innocutis management incentive payments of up to $3.0 million in cash over a three-year
	period based on the achievement of certain financial performance targets. The first component of the incentive program, related
	to achievement of an EBITDA target in 2015, was not achieved and as a result the maximum that could be paid out in the future is
	$2.0 million.


	No amounts have been accrued as at March 31, 2016.



	 


	In conjunction with the Innocutis acquisition, Cipher closed
	on a private offering of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the "Notes"), provided
	by investment funds managed by Athyrium Capital Management (together, "Athyrium"). The Company received an initial drawdown
	of $40 million, which was used to fund the majority of the purchase price for Innocutis. The remaining balance of the Notes will
	be made available to finance future acquisitions and is available to Cipher up until June 30, 2016. The Notes bear interest at
	a fixed rate of 10.25% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each quarter, and will mature in five years,
	unless earlier repurchased. The Notes are interest-only and are secured by assets of the Company, subject to certain exceptions.
	The Notes have certain restrictive covenants, including quarterly consolidated net revenue, minimum cash balance and consolidated
	leverage ratio. The parties entered into an amendment resulting in a reduction in the consolidated net revenue covenant for Q1
	2016 and accordingly, as at March 31, 2016 the Company is in compliance with all covenants.


	 


	In connection with the offering, Cipher issued Athyrium 600,000
	common share purchase warrants. The warrants are exercisable at $9.22 (equal to the five-day volume-weighted average price on the
	Toronto Stock Exchange prior to closing, converted to US dollars) and expire seven years following issuance.


	 


	Commercial Products Update


	 


	Absorica

	®

	/ Epuris

	®

	(CIP-ISOTRETINOIN)


	 


	CIP-ISOTRETINOIN is an innovative formulation of the active
	ingredient isotretinoin, which is used in the treatment of severe acne. CIP-ISOTRETINOIN, which is based on the same oral Lidose

	®

	drug delivery system used with Lipofen, has been in-licensed from Galephar Pharmaceutical Research Inc. (“Galephar”).
	The Company's marketing rights to this product include the Americas and a majority of the Pacific Rim. CIP-ISOTRETINOIN provides
	more consistent absorption under fed and fasted conditions, as compared to existing isotretinoin products. Due to its high lipophilicity,
	oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. CIP-ISOTRETINOIN is bioequivalent to Accutane

	®

	 (isotretinoin)
	capsules when both drugs are taken with a high-fat meal. However, when both drugs are taken under fasted conditions, CIP-ISOTRETINOIN
	provides 83% greater absorption than Accutane (isotretinoin) capsules. 


	 


	The product was launched by Cipher’s U.S. distribution
	partner Ranbaxy Laboratories Inc. (“Ranbaxy”) a Sun Pharma Company, in Q4 2012 under the trade name Absorica. The product
	has performed well since launch, achieving 18.1% market share by December 2015, based on total isotretinoin prescriptions (source:
	IMS).


	 


	According to IMS, the U.S. isotretinoin market was over US$680
	million in 2015, an increase of 8.1% over the prior year, with prescriptions growing by 8.6% on a year-over-year basis. Total isotretinoin
	prescriptions for Q1 2016 were 13.6% higher than the same period last year. Absorica prescriptions grew by 5.4% in Q1 2016 compared
	to Q1 2015 (source: IMS).


	 


	Absorica is currently protected by five issued patents which
	are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products List (Orange Book) which expire in September 2021. Cipher was issued
	a product patent (Patent Number 7,435,427) from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2008 with a second patent (Patent Number
	8,367,102) issued in 2013. A third patent (Patent Number 8,952,064) was issued in February 2015 and the fourth and fifth patents
	(Patent Numbers 9,078,925 and 9,089,534) were issued in July 2015. The five patents are formulation-related patents describing
	the product ingredients. There is one additional new Absorica patent application pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.


	 


	In October 2015, the Company, along with Ranbaxy and Galephar,
	entered into a Settlement Agreement with Actavis Laboratories F1, Inc., Andrx Corp., Actavis, Inc. and Actavis Pharma, Inc. ("Actavis")
	that dismissed the patent litigation suit.  As part of the


	 







	 Management’s Discussion &
	Analysis     |

	Settlement Agreement, Cipher, Ranbaxy and Galephar entered into
	a non-exclusive license agreement with Actavis under which Actavis may begin selling its generic version of Absorica

	®

	in the U.S. on December 27, 2020 (approximately nine months prior to the expiration of the patents in September 2021) or earlier
	under certain circumstances.


	 


	CIP-ISOTRETINOIN was also approved by Health Canada in Q4 2012
	under the trade name Epuris and Cipher launched the product in Canada in June 2013 with its own sales force. According to IMS,
	the Canadian market for isotretinoin in 2015 was CDN$17.5 million, an increase of 6.5% over 2014. Isotretinoin prescriptions in
	Canada for Q1 2016 increased by 5% compared to Q1 2015.


	 


	Epuris market share continues to grow in 2016 achieving a prescription
	market share of 20% in Q1 2016 (source: IMS) compared with 16.8% in Q1 2015. Epuris prescriptions grew by 23% in Q1 2016 over Q1
	2015 and over 42% in Canadian dollar terms.


	 


	Core Dermatology Products


	 


	SITAVIG

	®



	 


	Sitavig, which was launched in July 2014, is a unique, timed-release,
	mucoadhesive buccal tablet containing 50 mg of acyclovir indicated for the treatment of herpes labialis (cold sores). Administration
	of a single Sitavig tablet enables the active ingredient to penetrate the surrounding tissues in significantly higher concentrations
	than is possible through systemic delivery. Sitavig is the only treatment for herpes labialis that is proven to increase the time
	between oral herpes outbreaks and decrease the number of oral herpes outbreaks.


	 


	While the prescription herpes labialis market is largely genericized,
	it is a sizable market opportunity for Cipher. If converted to branded Sitavig dollars, the available market opportunity is $5.9
	billion.


	 


	Cipher is pursuing several strategies to capitalize on this
	market opportunity and increase market penetration of Sitavig. Sitavig currently has a 30% share of the topical branded anti-viral
	therapies prescribed by dermatologists.  Currently, 48% of the Sitavig TRxs come from Dermatology. Cipher is implementing
	an aggressive sales and marketing approach to enhance the Dermatology position. Historically, Cipher has only marketed to dermatologists,
	however, there is also a large non-dermatology component to the herpes labialis market. Cipher plans to broaden the potential of
	the product by expanding promotional efforts into other specialities and primary care, as well as using marketing, non-personal
	promotion and actively seeking partnerships to grow the non-dermatology market for Sitavig.  Total Sitavig prescriptions grew
	30% in Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 and net sales grew 66%.


	 


	NUVAIL

	®



	 


	Nuvail is a polymer solution (poly-ureaurethane) indicated for
	managing the signs and symptoms of nail dystrophy. The product is applied once-daily and dries with a clear matte finish.


	 


	The prescription nail dystrophy market is relatively small in
	the U.S. with $4.3 million in 2015 sales. Nuvail launched in June 2012 and in Q1 2016 maintains a 66% share of the nail dystrophy
	market. Nuvail net revenue was up over 39% in Q1 2016 over Q1 2015 and up 10% vs Q4 2015, despite the fact that prescriptions decreased
	by 4% in the same period, reflecting the continued impact of two new topical onychomycosis (“OM”) treatments which
	were launched in late 2014. OM and nail dystrophy are common comorbidities. It appears that the new OM treatments are competing
	with products indicated for nail dystrophy by only addressing the issue of fungus and not nail dystrophy. Cipher will focus on
	nail dystrophy which is often a pre-cursor to fungus infections. Nail dystrophy is seen in mycotic, psoriatic, and brittle
	nails.  It is estimated that 20% of adults in the U.S. have Brittle Nail Syndrome. 


	 


	BIONECT

	®



	 


	Bionect is a topical hyaluronic acid (“HA”) indicated
	for the treatment of signs and symptoms of skin irritation. The topical hyaluronic market was approximately $2.8 million in 2015.
	Total prescriptions decreased by 25% in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015. Bionect maintained 97% topical HA market share in Q1 2016.
	Prescriptions declined by 6% in Q1 2016 versus Q4 2015. To enhance the brand positioning, a new formulation of the product, Bionect
	Foam, was launched in January 2016.


	 


	Beteflam

	TM

	Patch


	 


	In 2012, Cipher obtained exclusive license and distribution
	rights in Canada to market the Beteflam Patch (previously named the Betesil Patch), a novel, patent-protected, self-adhesive medicated
	plaster for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as plaque psoriasis, from Institut Biochemique SA (“IBSA”).
	Based on feedback from Canadian dermatologists, the Beteflam Patch is expected to provide distinct advantages over existing treatment
	options, particularly for patients who suffer from plaque psoriasis in hard to treat areas such as knees and elbows. The efficacy
	and safety of the product has been established in two successful

	European Phase III trials and one successful Phase IV trial
	conducted by IBSA and it is currently marketed in several European countries. Beteflam was approved by Health Canada in December
	2015 and launched in Canada in April 2016.


	 


	Actikerall

	TM




	 



	Actikerall™ (0.5% fluorouracil and 10% salicylic acid)
	is indicated for the topical treatment of slightly palpable and/or moderately thick hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (Grade I/II)
	of the face, forehead, and balding scalp in immunocompetent adult patients. Actinic keratosis, also known as solar keratosis, is
	a skin condition caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Cipher acquired Actikerall™ from Almirall S.A. in May 2015
	and was launched in the Canadian market in February 2016.


	 


	VANIQA

	TM



	 


	VANIQA is a prescription cream clinically proven to reduce the
	growth of unwanted facial hair in women. VANIQA cream is an enzyme inhibitor and works by blocking an enzyme necessary for hair
	to grow. The product was approved by Health Canada in May 2001. Cipher acquired Actikerall™ from Almirall S.A. in May 2015
	and launched in the Canadian market in June 2015.


	 


	Other Royalty Products


	 


	Lipofen

	®

	(CIP-FENOFIBRATE)


	 


	Lipofen is a novel formulation of the active ingredient fenofibrate,
	which is used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, a cholesterol disorder. Hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by high levels
	of low-density lipoprotein (“LDL”) cholesterol and/or triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood). Fenofibrate
	is known to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and increase high-density lipoproteins (“HDL”), known as "good
	cholesterol''. Fibrates have proven to be superior in lowering triglycerides and raising HDL levels. Lipofen was the first product
	from the Company’s pipeline to receive FDA approval. Cipher’s U.S. marketing and distribution partner for Lipofen is
	Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. (“Kowa”).


	 


	According to IMS, the hyperlipidemia market in the U.S. exceeded
	$12.6 billion in 2015 and is made up of three primary groups of drugs: statins, fibrates and the prescription DHA/EPA (omega 3)
	market. The market for existing fenofibrate formulations in the U.S. was $1.0 billion during 2015, down from $1.2 billion in the
	previous year.


	 


	Lipofen was launched in the U.S. market in late 2007 and prescriptions
	have grown as Kowa increased coverage of the primary care physicians in its targeted regions and expanded its sales force. In Q2
	2014, Cipher and Kowa agreed to pre-emptively launch an authorized generic version of Lipofen in advance of the expiration of the
	product patent in January 2015. Prescriptions for Lipofen and the authorized generic were down 8% in Q1 2016 versus Q4 2015 reflecting
	reduced commercial effort by Kowa, however, the product continues to be a steady source of cash flow for Cipher.


	 


	ConZip

	®

	/ Durela

	®

	(CIP-TRAMADOL ER)


	 


	CIP-TRAMADOL ER is a novel, biphasic, extended-release formulation
	of the active ingredient tramadol, which is used for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain. CIP-TRAMADOL ER uses
	oral controlled-release beads, a drug delivery technology licensed from Galephar. The novel formulation delivers rapid absorption,
	similar absorption under different dietary conditions, and 24-hour coverage, supporting ease-of-use for physicians and a high level
	of compliance among chronic pain sufferers.


	 


	The product received FDA approval in 2010. In Q2 2011, Cipher
	entered into a distribution and supply agreement with Vertical Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Vertical”), a U.S.-based specialty
	pharmaceutical company and the product was launched in the U.S. in September 2011 by under the trade name ConZip. According to
	IMS, the U.S. market in 2015 for extended release formulations of tramadol exceeded US$60 million which represents 1.7% of the
	total tramadol immediate-release and extended-release prescription market. An authorized generic version of the product was launched
	by Cipher in the U.S. market in July 2015 through Vertical. Combined prescriptions for ConZip and the authorized generic were up
	35% in Q1 2016 vs Q1 2015.


	 


	Cipher received Health Canada approval for CIP-TRAMADOL ER in
	2011 and completed a Canadian distribution and supply agreement with Medical Futures Inc. (“Medical Futures”). The
	product was launched in Canada in March 2012 under the trade name Durela. In June 2015, Medical Futures was acquired by Tribute
	Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (“Tribute”) which has increased their commercial effort on Durela and during the same month
	POZEN Inc. announced the acquisition of Tribute, which is now complete. Effective February 5, 2016, the new combined company is
	now named Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. According to IMS, the Canadian market for extended-release tramadol was approximately CDN$27
	million in 2015, which was unchanged from 2014. Patents that expire in 2022 have been issued both in the U.S. and Canada for the
	product. Durela net sales were up 24% in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015.

	Pre-Commercial Products


	 


	Ozenoxacin


	 


	In Q1 2015, Cipher in-licensed the Canadian rights to Ozenoxacin,
	a topical treatment for adult and paediatric patients with impetigo, from Ferrer International SA (“Ferrer”), a privately-held
	Spanish pharmaceutical company. During Q3 2015, Ferrer successfully completed the second Phase III clinical trial for Ozenoxacin.
	Cipher anticipates a regulatory submission to Health Canada by June 2016, with a launch in 2017, if approved. Cipher is not responsible
	for any future development costs, should any be required.


	 


	Dermadexin™, Pruridexin™
	and ASF-1096


	 


	In Q1 2015, Cipher further strengthened its product pipeline
	by acquiring the worldwide rights to three products from Astion Pharma ("Astion"), a Denmark-based specialty pharmaceutical
	company. The three products are focused on inflammatory dermatological diseases: Dermadexin™, Pruridexin™, and ASF-1096.
	Dermadexin and Pruridexin target common, chronic conditions that are insufficiently addressed today. In Q3 2015, Cipher received
	an Acceptance Review Notification for its 510(k) submissions for both Dermadexin™ and Pruridexin™ to the FDA. 
	Cipher is responding to the FDAs request for more information and clarification. Pruridexin™ and Dermadexin™ were both
	submitted for review by Health Canada during Q3 2015. Subsequent to quarter end, Cipher received Health Canada approvals
	for SD Cream and AD Cream (also known as Dermadexin and Pruridexin). Both products were approved in Canada by the Natural
	and Non-Prescription Health Products Directorate. In addition European approval of Helioclin® Pruritus SD Cream (also
	known as Pruridexin) was received. Cipher has an orphan drug indication in the EU for ASF-1096, a product candidate that has promise
	as a treatment for a highly disfiguring rare disease, discoid lupus erythematosus, with no current cure. Cipher will pursue an
	efficient drug development program to support the approval of ASF-1096 in the North American and European markets.




	 


	CF101


	 


	In Q1 2015, Cipher in-licensed the Canadian distribution rights
	to CF101, a novel chemical entity being developed by Can-Fite for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.
	CF101 recently completed a Phase II/III double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which was designed to test the efficacy of CF101
	in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Top-line results from the trial were published by Can-Fite at the end of
	March 2015. Interim results from this Phase II/III trial and final results from the prior Phase II trial in psoriasis were both
	positive showing that CF101 effectively improved disease symptoms. In addition, at the end of 2013, Can-Fite completed a Phase
	IIb study for CF101 for active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), and has now completed the study design for a Phase III
	program. Can-Fite plans to start enrolling patients into the Phase III RA program in the first half of 2016 and start the psoriasis
	Phase III program in the second half of 2016. The timeline to regulatory submissions to Health Canada will be determined by the
	successful completion of these registration clinical trial programs. Cipher is not responsible for any of these development costs.


	 


	Nanolipolee-007


	 


	In December 2014, Cipher acquired the assets of Melanovus, a
	Pennsylvania-based life sciences company. The assets include seven pre-clinical compounds for the treatment of melanoma and other
	cancers, with world-wide rights. The lead product candidate, Nanolipolee-007, is a liposomal formulation of a plant-derived compound
	that is a first-in-class cholesterol-transport inhibitor which has demonstrated anti-proliferative activity against certain melanoma
	cell lines (including B-RAF resistant strains) in-vitro as well as in early in-vivo studies.  Cipher will pursue pre-clinical
	studies leading to Investigational New Drug status with the FDA, Health Canada and other health authorities.  The plan for
	the development of the remaining six topical and oral skin cancer compounds in the portfolio has not yet been established.


	 


	Out-Licensing Activities


	 


	Cipher continues to pursue marketing partners for CIP-ISOTRETINOIN
	in other territories, including Latin America. In 2014, Cipher entered into a distribution and supply agreement with Laboratorios
	Andrómaco S.A. ("Andrómaco") under which Cipher granted Andrómaco the exclusive right to market,
	sell and distribute Cipher's isotretinoin capsules in Chile. With over 70 years of experience, Andrómaco is a leader in
	the production and marketing of pharmaceutical products in Chile and certain other Latin American countries. The registration
	process is completed for 10 mg and 30 mg strengths and once regulatory approval for all strengths (10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg) is granted,
	it is expected that Cipher's product will be marketed, in the second half of 2016, under the brand name Lisacne-CIP, replacing
	Andrómaco's current isotretinoin product, Lisacne. Andrómaco is majority owned by Grünenthal GmbH, Germany.
	Under the terms of the agreement, Cipher achieved a modest regulatory milestone payment in Q3

	2015 and is eligible for commercial milestone payments. Cipher
	will also supply finished product to Andrómaco and product manufacturing will be fulfilled by Cipher's partner, Galephar.


	 


	In 2014, Cipher entered into a definitive distribution and supply
	agreement with Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (“Ranbaxy India”), a Sun Pharma Company, under which Cipher has granted
	them the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Cipher’s isotretinoin capsules in Brazil. Ranbaxy India plans
	to promote the product through a brand dermatology division in Brazil. Cipher’s isotretinoin formulation is expected to be
	the flagship product in Ranbaxy India’s dermatology franchise in Brazil, once it achieves regulatory approval. Brazil is
	the largest isotretinoin market in Latin America, with annual sales exceeding $50 million, and the market has been growing steadily.
	Under the terms of the agreement, Cipher has received an up-front payment and is eligible for additional pre-commercial milestone
	payments. Cipher will supply the finished product and product manufacturing will be done by Cipher's partner, Galephar. Ranbaxy
	India will be responsible for all regulatory-related activities associated with gaining and maintaining regulatory approval of
	the product in Brazil.

	Total revenue in Q1 2016 was $9.1 million compared to $7.4 million
	in Q1 2015, an increase of 23%. The increase in product revenue was primarily a result of the acquisition of Innocutis in Q2 2015.
	Product revenue from U.S. operations was $2.2 million in Q1 2016. Product revenue from Canadian products was $0.9 million compared
	to $0.7 million in Q1 2015. In local currency, the year-over-year growth in revenues was 60%. Licensing revenue was 12% lower in
	Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015.



	 




	Licensing Revenue



	 


	Revenue for Absorica was $4.6 million in Q1 2016 compared to
	$5.1 million in Q1 2015. Delays in finished goods product shipments impacted performance during the quarter, but are expected to
	be timing issues only as product shipments are expected to increase in Q2 2016. Market share was estimated at 18% in March 2016
	(Sources: Symphony, IMS, management estimates), compared to 19% in Q1 2015.


	 


	Revenue for Lipofen was $0.9 million in Q1 2016 compared to
	$1.2 million in Q1 2015. The product continues to perform adequately, despite the fact our partner, Kowa, has decreased their commercial
	efforts.


	 


	Revenue from the Company’s extended-release tramadol product
	(ConZip in the U.S. and Durela in Canada) was $0.5 million in Q1 2016, compared to $0.4 million in Q1 2015. Cipher’s partner,
	Vertical, launched an authorized generic version of the product in mid-2015.



	 




	Product Revenue



	 


	Product revenue growth in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015 was primarily
	driven by the products acquired with the acquisition of Innocutis, which was $2.2 million for the quarter. The increase was driven
	by Sitavig ($0.9 million), Nuvail ($0.7 million), Bionect ($0.4 million) and Inova ($0.1 million). Sitavig total prescriptions
	were up 35% in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015.


	 


	Canadian product revenue performance was driven by Epuris, with
	net sales of $0.8 million. Vaniqa (launched in May 2015) and Actikerall (launched in February 2016) made up the balance. In local
	currency, Canadian product revenue in Q1 2016 increased by 60% compared to Q1 2015.

	Selling and marketing expense in Q1 2016 was $3.8 million, compared to $0.5 million in Q1 2015.
	The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Innocutis in April 2015. The reported expenses in Q1 2015 only included
	the Canadian sales force and related marketing activities.  The U.S. based sales and marketing expenses are mainly focused
	on driving the growth of Sitavig, Nuvail and Bionect through an internal sales force and enhanced marketing efforts.

	The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of
	the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the Innocutis acquisition, which totalled $1.3 million in Q1 2016.


	 


	Intangible assets have a finite life and are amortized using
	the straight-line method over their estimated period of useful life. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events
	or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.

	Finance costs include interest on senior secured notes net of
	the gain from the change in the fair value of warrants and interest expense earned on surplus cash balances. The prior period figures
	only include interest income as the debt under the senior secured notes of $40 million was drawn down in conjunction with the Innocutis
	acquisition in Q2 2015. The interest rate on the debt is 10.25%. Finance costs in Q1 2016 is comprised of interest on senior secured
	notes of $1.3 million, loss from the change in the fair value of the warrants in the amount of $0.1 million due to an increase
	in stock price during the quarter, net of interest income.

	EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. The term EBITDA (earnings
	before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not
	be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Cipher defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense/income,
	income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash share-based compensation, changes
	in fair value of derivative financial instruments and foreign exchange gains and losses from the translation of Canadian cash balances.


	 


	The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA as a key metric in assessing
	business performance and considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance and cash flow, providing
	useful information to investors.


	 


	The following is a summary of how EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
	are calculated (in thousands of U.S. dollars):

	The gain from translation of Canadian cash balances does not
	have a comparative amount because the functional currency of the Canadian entity at March 31, 2015 was Canadian dollars.


	 


	Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $(0.3) million, a decrease of
	$4.3 million compared to Q1 2015. The reduction in Adjusted EBITDA for the period primarily reflects the operating losses incurred
	in the Company’s U.S. operations.


	 


	Income Taxes


	 


	Income tax expense is recognized based
	on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These rates are then
	adjusted to effective tax rates based on management's estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the
	full year in each jurisdiction taking into account taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction and available utilization of deferred
	tax assets. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the asset can be recovered. The income tax
	expense relates to a drawdown of the deferred tax asset of the Canadian operations. The income tax expense relates to a drawdown
	of the deferred tax assets related to the Canadian operations.

	Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average
	number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated taking into account dilutive instruments
	that are outstanding. For the three month period ended March 31, 2016, the computation of diluted loss per share is equal to the
	basic loss per share due to the anti-dilutive effect of the stock options and RSUs.


	 


	Net loss in Q1 2016 was ($2.7) million, or ($0.10) per basic
	share, compared to net income of $2.5 million, or $0.10 per basic share, in Q1 2015.


	 


	The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period
	ended March 31, 2016 was 26,086,669 (2015 - 25,838,270). The dilutive weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period
	ended March 31, 2016 was 26,339,974 (2015 - 26,594,956).

	Liquidity and Capital Resources


	 


	As at March 31, 2016, the Company has cash and cash equivalents
	of $28.8 million, compared to $27.2 million as at December 31, 2015. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016 the Company generated
	net cash from operating activities of $1.4 million.


	 


	The balance of accounts receivable was $15.6 million at March
	31, 2016, compared to $16.3 million as at December 31, 2015.


	 


	The balance of accounts payable and accrued liabilities was
	$13.7 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $13.4 million as at December 31, 2015. The balance of provisions was $5.5 million at
	March 31, 2016 compared to $4.4 million as at December 31, 2015. The changes in both of these balances reflects normal fluctuations
	in business operations and changes in certain programs and pricing for the period.


	 


	Deferred revenue primarily relates to amounts received in advance
	of recognition as revenue. The balance of $0.7 million at March 31, 2016 relates primarily to the up-front licensing payments and
	pre-commercialization milestone payments received by Cipher under the CIP-ISOTRETINOIN distribution and supply agreement, net of
	revenue recognized to date. The deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2015 was $0.8 million and the decrease relates to revenue
	recognized during the period.


	 


	Future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors,
	including expenditures on R&D for product candidates, costs associated with maintaining regulatory approvals, the timing of
	payments received or made under licensing or other collaborative agreements, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting,
	maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, defending against patent infringement
	claims, the acquisition of licenses for new products or technologies, the status of competitive products and the success of the
	Company in developing and maintaining markets for its products.


	 


	As at March 31, 2016, there are no finance lease contractual
	obligations. The only significant operating lease contractual obligations are related to the Company’s office locations.
	The lease for the Company’s Canadian premises expires at the end of December 2018. The lease for the Company’s U.S.
	premises expires in January 2023.

	Share Capital


	 


	The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of preference
	shares, issuable in series, and an unlimited number of voting common shares. At March 31, 2016, the Company had 26,161,662 common
	shares issued and outstanding. Subsequent to quarter-end, 6,069 common shares were issued under the employee and director share
	purchase plan, bringing the total number of common shares issued and outstanding to 26,167,731 as of the date of this MD&A.


	 


	A total of 503,457 stock options were granted during Q1 2016
	with exercise prices of $4.93, $4.65 and CDN$6.79.


	 


	Share-based compensation expense in Q1 2016 was $0.8 million,
	compared to $0.4 million in Q1 2015. The Company’s long term incentive programs were extended to the new employees who joined
	following the Innocutis acquisition in Q2 2015.


	 


	Galephar Pharmaceutical Research Inc.


	 


	In 2002, the Company entered into a Master Licensing and Clinical
	Supply Agreement ("the Agreement") with Galephar, a Puerto Rico based pharmaceutical research and manufacturing company.
	Under the Agreement, the Company acquired the rights to package, test, obtain regulatory approvals and market CIP-FENOFIBRATE,
	CIP-ISOTRETINOIN and CIP-TRAMADOL ER ("the CIP Products") in various territories. In accordance with the Agreement, the
	Company retains 50% of all revenue from licensing and distribution arrangements with respect to the CIP Products, with the other
	50% due to Galephar. Where the Company has opted to market and sell a CIP Product directly in a territory, the Company pays a royalty
	to Galephar. Galephar retains the right to manufacture and supply the CIP Products. With respect to licensing and distribution
	arrangements, the Company manages the product supply arrangements with their respective marketing partners and Galephar; product
	is shipped directly from Galephar to the respective marketing partners. Where the Company has opted to market and sell the CIP
	Product directly, the Company purchases the finished goods from Galephar directly.


	 


	Financial Instruments


	 


	At March 31, 2016, financial instruments consisted of cash and
	cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, other long term liability, senior secured notes
	and a derivative financial instrument. The derivative financial instrument is measured at fair value with any changes recognized
	through the statement of earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long-term liability are measured
	at amortized cost and their fair values approximate carrying values.


	 


	The senior secured notes are measured at amortized cost. At
	March 31, 2016, the fair value of the senior secured notes approximates their face value of $40.0 million. The fair value is based
	on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate.


	 


	The Company's financial instruments are exposed to certain financial
	risks, including currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.


	 


	Risk Factors


	 


	Reference is made to the description of risk factors with respect
	to the Company and its business in the Company’s most recently filed Annual Information Form filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com
	and in the corresponding Form 40-F, and to related information in other filings with Canadian and U.S. securities regulatory authorities.


	 


	Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	 


	There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting during the most recent interim period ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	Effective April 13, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding
	members’ interests of Innocutis. The results of Innocutis' operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements
	since the date of acquisition. However, the Company has not had sufficient time to appropriately assess the internal controls used
	by Innocutis and integrate them with those of the Company. As a result, the Innocutis operations have been excluded in the Company’s
	assessment of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is in the process
	of integrating the Innocutis operations and


	 







	 Management’s Discussion &
	Analysis     |
	 

	13






	 






	 





	 




	 


	will be expanding its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
	financial reporting compliance programs to include Innocutis.


	 


	As of the end of the period covered by this MD&A and the
	accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements, the Company’s management evaluated the design of its disclosure
	controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation and subject to the scope exclusion
	described above, the Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and
	internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of condensed interim consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS
	as at March 31, 2016.

	BASIS OF PREPARATION





	These condensed interim consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International
	Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"), applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34,

	Interim Financial Reporting

	. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
	the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as
	issued by the IASB. The Board of Directors approved these condensed interim consolidated financial statements on May 4, 2016.


	 



	Change in presentation currency



	Effective April 2015, Cipher changed its presentation
	currency from Canadian dollars to United States dollars. The change in presentation currency was made to better reflect the Company's
	business activities and to improve investor's ability to compare the Company's financial results with other publicly traded businesses
	in the industry. In making the change to a US dollar presentation currency, the Company followed the guidance in IAS 21:

	The
	Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates

	(IAS 21) and applied the change retrospectively as if the new presentation currency
	had always been the Company's presentation currency. In accordance with IAS 21, the financial statements for all the periods presented
	have been translated to the US dollar presentation currency. For comparative balances, assets and liabilities have been translated
	into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date, or at the exchange rate prevailing at
	the date of the transactions. Exchange rate differences arising on translation are taken to accumulated other comprehensive income.
	The Company has presented the effects of the change in the presentation currency below.

	Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted



	IFRS 15,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	:
	This standard replaces International Accounting Standards ("IAS") 11

	Construction


	Contracts,

	IAS 18,

	Revenue

	and IFRIC 13,

	Customer Loyalty Programmes

	. This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities
	to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The latest date of mandatory implementation of IFRS 15 is January
	1, 2018. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact on the consolidated financial statements.



	 



	IFRS 9,

	Financial Instruments:

	The final version
	of IFRS 9,

	Financial Instruments

	, was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and will replace IAS 39,

	Financial Instruments:
	Recognition and Measurement

	. IFRS 9 introduces a model for classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected
	loss’ impairment model and a substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting. The new single, principle based approach
	for determining the classification of financial assets is driven by cash flow characteristics and the business model in which an
	asset is held. The new model also results in a single impairment model being applied to all financial instruments, which will require
	more timely recognition of expected credit losses. It also includes changes in respect of own credit risk in measuring liabilities
	elected to be measured at fair value, so that gains caused by the deterioration of an entity’s own credit risk on such liabilities
	are no longer recognized in profit or loss. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
	however is available for early adoption. In addition, the own credit changes can be early applied in isolation without otherwise
	changing the accounting for financial instruments. The Company is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9 and has not yet determined
	when it will adopt the new standard.



	 



	IFRS 16,

	Leases

	: On January 13, 2016, the
	IASB published a new standard, IFRS 16,

	Leases

	. The new standard will eliminate the distinction between operating and finance
	leases and will bring most leases on the balance sheet for lessees. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	on or after January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact on the consolidated financial statements.

	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SENIOR SECURED NOTES





	Under certain agreements, the Company has the right
	to set-off financial assets with financial liabilities with respect to advances, rebates and licensing payments. At March 31, 2016,
	the Company had gross financial assets of $3 and gross financial liabilities of $6,476 related to Galephar. The net amount of $6,473
	owing to Galephar has been recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March 31, 2016 (gross financial assets of $78
	and gross financial liabilities of $6,310 for a net amount of $6,232 owing at December 31, 2015).


	 


	In connection with the acquisition of Innocutis Holdings,
	LLC ("Innocutis"), the Company closed a private offering of $100,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
	Notes due in 2020 ("Notes"). The Company received an initial draw down of $40,000, which was used to fund the majority
	of the purchase price for Innocutis. The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 10.25% per annum payable quarterly and will mature
	in five years, unless repurchased earlier. The Notes are secured by all present and future assets of the Company and have certain
	restrictive covenants, including quarterly consolidated net revenue, minimum cash balance and consolidated leverage ratio. The
	parties entered into an amendment resulting in a reduction in the consolidated net revenue covenant for Q1 2016 and accordingly,
	at March 31, 2016 is in compliance with all covenants.


	 


	In connection with the offering, the Company issued
	600,000 common share purchase warrants to the lender with an option for a cashless exercise in which the settlement price caused
	the conversion ratio to be variable. Accordingly, the warrants are classified as a financial liability. Gains and losses on re-measurement
	are presented separately in the statements of earnings and comprehensive income. The exercise price of the warrants is $9.22 (equal
	to the five day volume-weighted average price on the Toronto Stock Exchange prior to closing, converted to US dollars) and expire
	seven years from the date of issuance. A pricing model with observable market-based inputs was used to estimate the fair value
	of the warrants issued. The estimated fair value of the warrants at April 13, 2015, December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 were $4,132,
	$1,758 and $1,840, respectively.


	 


	The variables used to compute the fair value as at
	April 13, 2015 and March 31, 2016 are as follows:

	Total debt issuance costs associated with the Notes
	of $2,119 have been netted against the Notes on the consolidated balance sheets. Additional costs of $1,810 which relate to the
	undrawn portion of the Notes have been included in prepaid expenses and other assets.


	 



	Fair value of financial instruments


	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is quoted bid or ask prices in
	an active market. Quoted prices are not always available for over-the-counter transactions, as well as transactions in inactive
	or illiquid markets. In these instances, pricing models, normally with observable market based inputs, are used to estimate fair
	value. Financial instruments traded in a less active market have been valued using indicative market prices, present value or other
	valuation techniques. Where financial instruments trade in inactive markets or when using models where observable parameters do
	not exist, greater management judgement is required for valuation purposes. In addition, the calculation of estimated fair value
	is based on market conditions at a specific point in time and therefore may not be reflective of future fair values.


	 


	At March 31, 2016, the Company’s financial
	instruments consisted of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, other long term
	liability, the Notes and derivative financial instrument. The derivative financial instrument is measured at fair value with any
	changes recognized through the statements of earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) and is classified as Level 2 (as defined
	under IFRS). Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long term liability
	are measured at amortized cost and their fair values approximate carrying values.


	 


	The Notes are measured at amortized cost. At March
	31, 2016, the fair value of the Notes approximates its face value of $40,000. The fair values are based on cash flows discounted
	using a rate based on the borrowing rate.

	LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH GALEPHAR





	In 2002, the Company entered into a Master Licensing
	and Clinical Supply Agreement ("the Agreement") with Galephar, a Puerto Rico based pharmaceutical research and manufacturing
	company. Under the Agreement, the Company acquired the rights to package, test, obtain regulatory approvals and market CIP-FENOFIBRATE,
	CIP-ISOTRETINOIN and CIP-TRAMADOL ER ("the CIP Products") in various countries. In accordance with the Agreement, the
	Company retains 50% of all revenue from licensing and distribution arrangements entered into with respect to the CIP Products,
	with the other 50% due to Galephar. Where the Company has opted to market and sell a CIP Product directly in a territory, the Company
	pays a royalty to Galephar. Galephar retains the right to manufacture and supply the CIP Products. With respect to licensing and
	distribution arrangements, the Company manages the product supply arrangements with their respective marketing partners and Galephar;
	product is shipped directly from Galephar to the respective marketing partners. Where the Company has opted to market and sell
	the CIP Product directly, the Company purchases the finished goods from Galephar directly.


	 


	With respect to CIP-ISOTRETINOIN, the Company has
	entered into licensing and distribution arrangements for the U.S. and Brazil, while opting to market and sell the product directly
	in Canada. The Company also has in place various licensing and distribution arrangements with respect to CIP-FENOFIBRATE and CIP-TRAMADOL
	ER in Canada, the U.S. and Central and South America.

	Provisions relate to estimates made for returns,

	transactions, namely product sales, the payments made for the underlying transactions are made directly to the claimants concerned
	and not to the original customer. Actual costs for these charges and estimates are recorded when incurred. The recorded provisions
	are for the uninvoiced portion of these costs and estimates. The provision for product returns relates to potential returns due
	to expiration or other return rights under the terms of distribution and supply agreements with customers. The adequacy of the
	provisions are evaluated based on product sales activity, pricing and estimates of expiring products in the distribution chain.

	Share purchase plan



	The Company has an Employee and Director Share Purchase
	Plan ("ESPP") to allow employees and directors to share in the growth of the Company through share ownership. Through
	the ESPP, employees and directors may contribute amounts to purchase shares of the Company at a 15% discount from the prevailing
	trading price. Plan members must hold their shares for a period of at least six months before they can be sold. The shares issued
	under the ESPP are new shares issued from treasury and the maximum number of shares that can be issued under the ESPP is one million.
	During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, 38,212 shares were issued under the ESPP (3,330 in Q1 2015). Included in share-based compensation
	expense is $25 ($6 in Q1 2015), which is the discount on the shares issued during the period. As at March 31, 2016, 578,900 common
	shares reserved for ESPP purchases remain available under the plan.

	INCOME TAXES





	Management uses estimates when determining current
	and deferred income taxes. These estimates are used to determine the recoverability of tax loss carry forward amounts, research
	and development expenditures and investment tax credits. Significant judgment is required regarding future probability of the Company
	to be able to realize deferred taxes. Changes in market conditions, changes in tax legislation, patent challenges and other factors,
	including the approval or launch of generic versions of any of the Company’s products, could adversely affect the ongoing
	value of deferred taxes. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reassessed at each reporting period and reduced to
	the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to utilize all or part of the deferred
	income tax assets. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting period and are recognized to the extent
	that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.


	 


	Income tax expense is recognized based on the best
	estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.


	 


	Income tax expense as reported differs from the amount
	that would be computed by applying the combined Canadian federal and provincial statutory income tax rates to income before income
	taxes. The reasons for the differences are as follows:

	EARNINGS PER SHARE





	Earnings per share is calculated using the weighted
	average number of shares outstanding. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2016
	was 26,086,669 (for the three months ended March 31, 2015 - 25,838,270).


	 


	Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the
	weighted average number of shares outstanding taking into consideration the weighted average impact of dilutive securities. For
	the three month period ended March 31, 2016, the computation of diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share due
	to the anti-dilutive effect of the stock options and RSUs. The dilutive weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three
	months ended March 31, 2016 was 26,339,974 (for the three months ended March 31, 2015 - 26,594,956).


	 







	12




	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES





	Directors and officers are indemnified by the Company
	for various items including, but not limited to, costs to settle lawsuits or actions due to their association with the Company,
	subject to certain restrictions. The Company has purchased directors and officers liability insurance to mitigate the cost of any
	potential future lawsuits or actions. The term of the indemnification covers the period during which the indemnified party served
	as a director or officer of the Company.


	 


	In the normal course of business, the Company has
	entered into agreements that include indemnities in favour of third parties, such as purchase and sale agreements, confidentiality
	agreements, engagement letters with advisors and consultants, leasing contracts, license agreements, information technology agreements
	and various product, service, data hosting and network access agreements. These indemnification arrangements may require the applicable
	entity to compensate counterparties for losses incurred by the counterparties as a result of breaches in representations, covenants
	and warranties provided by the Company or as a result of litigation or other third party claims or statutory sanctions that may
	be suffered by the counterparties as a consequence of the relevant transaction. In some instances, the terms of these indemnities
	are not explicitly defined.


	 


	In the normal course of business, the Company may
	be the subject of litigation or other potential claims. While management assesses the merits of each lawsuit and defends itself
	accordingly, the Company may be required to incur significant expenses or devote significant resources to defending itself against
	litigation. At March 31, 2016 no amounts were accrued (December 31, 2015 - nil).

	SEGMENTED INFORMATION

	industry segment, being specialty pharmaceuticals. The Company is managed geographically in Canada and the United States commencing
	in Q2 2015 with the acquisition of Innocutis. Before the acquisition of Innocutis the Company only had one segment and accordingly

	by the interim filings.




	 






	3.




	Fair presentation:


	Based on my knowledge, having exercised reasonable diligence,
	the interim financial statements together with the other financial information included in the interim filings fairly present in

	periods presented in the interim filings.




	 






	4.




	Responsibility:


	The issuer’s other certifying officer and I are responsible
	for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (DC&P) and internal control over financial reporting (ICFR),

	,

	6.

Cipher Pharmaceuticals (DND.TO) Acquires Three Products From Astion Pharma 











Tweet








2/26/2015 6:56:22 AM


 Strengthens dermatology product pipeline with rights to three products  MISSISSAUGA, ON, Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:CPHR; TSX:CPH) ("Cipher" or "the Company") today announced it has strengthened its product pipeline by acquiring  the worldwide rights to three products from Astion Pharma ("Astion"), a Denmark-based specialty pharmaceutical company. The three products are focused on inflammatory dermatological diseases: Dermadexin, Pruridexin, and ASF-1096. Dermadexin is a patent-protected topical barrier-repair cream containing the pharmacologically active ingredient P3GCM. The product was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2014 as a Class III medical device for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin disorder affecting the scalp, face, and torso. Dermadexin SD Cream has been tested in two placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (436 patients) where it displayed a marked and statistically significant effect on the symptoms of facial seborrhoeic dermatitis with a fast onset of action and an increasing effect over time. Pruridexin is a patent-protected topical cream for the treatment of chronic pruritis (itching), which is a significant unmet need. Pruridexin was submitted to the European Medicines Agency in 2014 as a Class III medical device and is under active review with a response expected in the first half of 2015. Pruridexin Cream has been tested in two placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (352 patients) and displayed a marked and statistically significant effect on the pruritus with a fast onset of action and an increasing effect over time. ASF-1096 is a product candidate in phase II that is being investigated as a treatment for discoid lupus erythematosus, a severe, chronic, inflammatory and disfiguring skin disease that affects about 3 out of 10,000 in the general population. ASF-1096 has been awarded orphan drug status in the EU. "This transaction strengthens our dermatology product pipeline and gives us two late-stage assets in Dermadexin and Pruridexin that target common, chronic conditions that are insufficiently addressed today," said Shawn O'Brien, President & Chief Executive Officer of Cipher. "We believe there is a sizable market opportunity for these products and aim to submit both for U.S. regulatory approval in the first half of 2015, followed by Canadian regulatory approval. We will also pursue an orphan drug indication in the U.S. for ASF-1096, a product candidate that has promise as a treatment for a highly disfiguring rare disease with no current cure."Mr. O'Brien added: "One of our strategic priorities is to establish U.S. commercial infrastructure focused on dermatology. If approved, we expect to commercialize these products on our own in the U.S. and Canada." The transaction includes an upfront payment to Astion of CDN$6.0 million, which was funded using Cipher's current cash resources. A subsequent CDN$2.5 million milestone will be paid upon regulatory approval and commercialization of Dermadexin or Pruridexin in the U.S, which is where Cipher will focus its commercialization efforts. The agreement includes approximately CDN$31.5 million in additional payments contingent upon clinical milestones, regulatory approvals, commercialization and sales milestones in the both the U.S. and other regions. Over time, Cipher expects to out-license the products to partners in certain other regions. About Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc.Cipher Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPHR; TSX:CPH) is a growing specialty pharmaceutical company focused on dermatology.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

Finding lifesaving medicines is a life's work – the work of 140,000 researchers who never say never. As well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
DO NOT GO GENTLE
Today's breakthroughs are becoming tomorrow's medicines.

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.
