Armored AutoGroup Inc., headquartered in Danbury, Conn., is primarily comprised of the Armor All® and STP® brands. The current Armor All product line of protectants, wipes, tire and wheel care products, glass cleaners, leather care products and washes is designed to clean, shine and protect interior and exterior automobile surfaces. The STP product line of oil and fuel additives, functional fluids and automotive appearance products has a broad customer base ranging from professional racers to car enthusiasts and “Do-it-Yourselfers”.
In March 2014, Armored AutoGroup Parent, Inc. (“Armored AutoGroup”) purchased IDQ Acquisition Corp (“IDQ”), the leading manufacturer of do-it-yourself air conditioner recharge products. IDQ products include air conditioning recharge and retrofit kits, premium refrigerant blends, specialty chemicals, straight refrigerants and a wide range of complementary do-it-yourself and professional-use items. IDQ products are branded under labels including A/C PRO®, Arctic Freeze®, Sub Zero® and Super Seal Stop Leak® and are sold through approximately 25,000 retail stores.


Our company has a diversified geographic footprint with direct operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and the U.K. and distributor relationships in approximately 50 countries.
On July 26, 2012, the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-4 was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and on August 23, 2012 the Company completed the related exchange of all its outstanding Senior Notes, having an aggregate principal amount of $275,000,000.

			Staying ahead of the game and driving a successful migration with SAP		

Read Full Story &raquo


 


About the Project
Armored AutoGroup (AAG) considered a number of options. The company ultimately selected itelligence as its implemementation partner since it was a one-stop-shop and included a best practice template that allowed for rapid implementation. itelligence worked with AAG to migrate its financials to SAP and began running that part of their business in SAP. After the financials group rapidly experienced numerous benefits and, knowing that itelligence could provide the necessary SAP elements to support a quick transition from the parent company to the desired self-standing operation, AAG promptly decided to migrate other business functions. In November 2011, the company embarked on the ultimate system go-live.
itelligence helped AAG implement the SAP financial and supply chain modules including EDI, Business Intelligence (BW/BOBJ) and Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO). After a successful implementation, AAG began enhancing and optimization their business processes and SAP landscape by rolling out additional ECC functionality, including extending their use of BW/BOBJ.
In 2012, AAG and itelligence’s AMS organization began the process of framing a long-term strategic partnership focused on AAG’s long-term SAP Run Strategy. During that time, AAG and itelligence agreed to a “stepped down” methodology to gradually reduce the number of “run” hours AAG used each month.
This transformation was executed over two years. Through the trusted partnership, itelligence was able to efficiently and effectively guide AAG through the entire process.
