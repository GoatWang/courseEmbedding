John Goddard






Credits / Citations
 
b. Dartmouth, MA, January 20, 1723/24.
d. Newport, RI, July 16, 1785.
 
Best known cabinetmaker of that name.  After birth, parents move to Newport.  Most likely learns craft from Job Townsend, Sr.  Married Job’s daughter Hannah in 1746. 
 
Recognized as the leading cabinetmaker in Newport by the 1760s - his customers include Moses Brown of Providence and Gov. Stephen Hopkins. 
 
Identified with development of "block front" design.  Claimed to be the  most distinctively American product in woodwork, especially when the block was surmounted by the shell.    Much debate concerning design credit.  It has been suggested Job, Sr. was the innovator and Goddard was the perfector of this design. 
 
Records of his work were lost during the Revolution as the British probably ruined his business.  His sons and grandson participate in the furniture business. 
 
Job Townsend (1699 or 1700-1765) is the famous first cabinetmaker of that name.   His brother Christopher (1701-1773/1787?) is often referred to as the "shipjoiner."  Both were established in the furniture trade by the 1730’s. 
 
John Townsend (1732-1809), the son of Christopher, in time becomes the most important and best known of the Townsend clan, he is claimed to be one of America’s greatest furniture makers. 
 
The Point Section of Newport is sometimes referred to as the "furniture maker’s center."  Furniture makers had homes and shops along the cove, where finished product would be loaded onto ships for export.  The cove has since been filled in. 
 
John Goddard and son Thomas’s (1765-1858) home and shop was once located on the present day site of Sanford Covell Villa Marina, northwest corner of Washington and Willow Streets.  In late 1860’s, original house moved to where it stands at #81 Second Street.  Thomas Goddard’s shop was moved to Smith Court (demolished before 1970 to make way for America’s Cup Avenue). 
 
Thomas Goddard’s other house stands at northwest corner of Church and School Streets, across from the Masonic Temple.  Grandson John Goddard (1789-1843), had a shop and warehouse at the northeast corner of Bridge and Second Streets. 
 
Townsend family owned the entire block within the streets of Bridge, Elm, Second and Third.  There are several buildings standing today that are associated with the family, e.g. 
 #14 Third Street - Thomas 
 #53 Bridge Street - Thomas 
 #70 Bridge Street - John 
 #74 and 76 Bridge Street - Christopher 
 #19 Second Street - John 
 #51 Second Street - Solomon 
 The home of Job and Job Jr., once stood on northwest corner of Third and Bridge Streets.  Once known as #59 Bridge, house existed until the 1950’s.  Newport Restoration Foundation House moved to this property. 
 
Considered as a group, "Goddard-Townsend" dominated the Newport business.  They worked closely together, there was intermarriage.  Besides furniture making, these two Quaker families were carpenters, house builders, and shipjoiners (not uncommon in this era).  Over a dozen family members participated in the business. 
 
After 1750, Newport’s furniture craftsmen produced quality, design and originality.  Due to the wealth of local citizens, and Newport as a center of arts, the business flourished.  The export sites included Charleston, SC, and the West Indies. 
 
As one of the outstanding groups of American furniture makers during the 18th and 19th centuries, Goddard’s and Townsend’s works are considered masterpieces - valuable and prestigious.
