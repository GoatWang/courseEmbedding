I  WAS the fourth of five children, raised in San Jose, Calif., with a stay-at-home mother and a father who was an operations manager for Lockheed’s missile systems division. My dad earned his master’s degree while working full time when we were little. He was my first role model when it came to working hard.I studied communications at Santa Clara University. To earn cash, I worked as a waitress in the evenings. Some of my customers worked at a nearby communications company, 8x8 Inc., that manufactured and sold video phones. Those customers liked me enough to offer me an internship. Then, when I graduated in 1997, I landed a full-time job in its marketing department.Two years later, I went to work at Infogear Technology, in Redwood City, south of San Francisco. Cisco Systems acquired the company in 1999, and I worked there for six months — long enough to know that I didn’t like working for a big company.

My friend Jim Clark, who had founded Netscape, suggested that I apply at his new online photo sharing company, Shutterfly. I joined the marketing team in 2000. I loved it. I had amazing mentors and earned great experience. Continue reading the main story

Around that time, I met my husband, Dominick, who is an avid rock climber like me. We married in June 2004 after he completed his doctorate at M.I.T.

That fall, I saw a Craigslist ad for a marketing manager at Backcountry.com. The company was based near — now in — Park City, Utah, a great place for skiing, which both my husband and I love. Jim Holland, an Olympic ski jumper, and John Bresee, a self-proclaimed ski bum, founded the company in 1996. My cover letter was about four lines and wasn’t very good, but they must have liked it. I started in November as the manager of a small online marketing team charged with exploring niche markets and expanding marketing capabilities.I asked my husband, who was working on a start-up venture, to drive me every day down the steep, icy road from our Park City home to the office in Heber City. Winters in Utah are not like winters in California. I finally did get the hang of winter driving, but it took some time.Beyond the weather, the transition to the new job was a big shock. My desk was an old door sitting on crates, and on the first day I had to build my desk chair.My husband and I did lots of climbing, skiing, mountain biking and trail running in the early years. Then, in 2007, we had our first child, a girl. That same year, the company was acquired by Liberty Interactive, a digital commerce business. In 2009, I was named Backcountry.com’s vice president for product management, to continue to develop our Web sites. The next year, I was named chief operating officer to oversee all operations. Last year, I was promoted to chief executive of Backcountry.com.Backcountry continues to grow. Our revenue is now 14 times greater than when I started at the company; we have nine Web sites, including Competitive Cyclist, a recent acquisition; and we employ about 750 people. Last year, I was a mentor with Liberty Interactive’s Women’s e-Commerce Network, which pairs experienced executive women with up-and-comers. I was reinvigorated by my experience advising a young Harvard Business School graduate, Vivian Weng, on her start-up, FashionStake.com (recently acquired by Fab.com). The experience was a refreshing reminder of the importance of innovation.Life is good and business is good. My single complaint is that since our first child was born — we had a second daughter last year — I have been doing far less skiing and climbing than I would like.

We are passionate about the outdoors – whether it be skiing,  cycling, climbing, snowboarding or surfing and we do our best everyday  to pass along that passion by delivering the best customer experience to  our customers.  That often means ge...tting them gear blisteringly fast  and creating solutions when our customers need our help.  Checkout the  customer email we received below — I think our VP of Fulfillment, Jeff  Carter’s, 4 word response to the email was perfect — “It’s what we do”. Nuff said, nice job team. —–Original Message—–Sent: Thursday, August 04, 2011 9:31 AMTo: Customerexperience; CssupervisorsSubject: dogfunk – Dogfunk Hello,I  honestly never do this, but I feel compelled to.  I honestly don’t  think I have given feedback about anything I have ordered online from  any company, so this is a first.  I just want to express my satisfaction  for you guys.  This is by far my favorite website to order all of my  gear from.  I have never had an order ship, literally within an hour, on  the same day that I ordered it.  I have also messed up my  shipping/billing address a couple of times and had to call to get them  fixed.  Not only was my problem solved right away, the employees I  talked to were super nice, helpful, and just generally cool people.   Keep up the good work Dogfunk and I will continue to spread the word. P.S. – You gotta give your employees a raise because the service I have received is unparalleled Thanks 展开Jill Layfield · 2011年4月14日 · LeaderboardWe’ve changed up our Leaderboard. The  big idea when we started our Leaderboard was to create a dynamic  ranking of members who take the time to contribute content to make  Backcountry.com, and the gear information we share better. The problem,  though, was that it wasn’t dynamic at all. The few and the proud reached  the top of the board and staye...d there. Forever. That  means that we didn’t do a very good job of building the system. We also  didn’t do a good job of being transparent, either. Nobody, not even the  Leaderboard champs, knew how many points they had, how many points they  needed to overtake the person in front of them, or who was coming up  from behind. We had to do better. So here’s what we’ve decided to change:We've increased the value of certain contributions. Now instead of 1 point for every action, you’ll earn:-3 points every time you post a video, photo or review;-2 points every time you answer a question;-1 point every time you vote something as helpful, leave a comment or ask a question.Each  point now has a half-life and automatically changes to half-point after  190 days. If you don’t post for a long time, you’ll fall in the  rankings.Point totals will be calculated nightly.You’ll see exactly how many points everyone on the Leaderboard has.In  short, we’re adding a little more game to the game. We know that change  is, well, different, but we really hope that you check it out and keep  contributing. We’re going to do what we can to keep things exciting in  the Community, and that means more changes down the line. If you have  any great ideas, please let our Community Product Manager know -  Clint Gordon-Carroll (cgc@backcountry.com).  In the meantime, we hope that you’ll be advocate  for change if/when your friends ask what’s up. 展开Jill Layfield · 2011年2月24日 · One of our rock star project managers, Michael Burleson, highlighted Quirky.com today praising their crowdsourcing approach to product development and the way they leverage and incentivize their community.

In March 2011 she was named CEO of online retail giant backcountry.com, one of the largest player's in Utah's outdoor industry. Jill joined backcountry.com in 2004 as director of customer marketing, responsible for 3/4 of the company's revenue. In 2009 she advanced to vice president of product management. Jill got her start in the e-commerce industry working with shutterfly.com, Cisco Systems and two tech start-ups.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)

Backcountry.com Promotes Jill Layfield to COO


March 30, 2010

                By Kailee Bradstreet










Formerly the vice president of product management, Jill Layfield has been promoted to chief operating officer for Backcountry.com. In the newly created position, Layfield will be responsible for managing day-to-day operations, according to SportsOneSource.com:
“In a statement to the company on Thursday, Backcountry CEO Jim Holland and President John Bresee explained the move. “Jill started with us when we were still in the garage in Heber. Since then, through her work in marketing and product management, she has gained a thorough understanding of our business. Those who know Jill know her to be uncommonly energetic and upbeat. Her optimism and enthusiasm are contagious.
“She is a confident, focused leader with the ability to turn complex issues into manageable challenges, and to make any lofty goal achievable through step-by-step processes. One of Jill’s greatest strengths is managing people. She is a pleasure to work with because she respects everyone’s intelligence and capabilities and she encourages us all to stretch and reach higher in pursuit of our shared goals.”
Other changes announced included CMO Dustin Robertson adding Corporate Development to his group; CFO Scott Klossner being promoted to CFO/SVP of Supply Chain Operations; and Sam Bruni, formerly director of ODAT division, expanding his responsibilities as the new General Manager of Business Unit Operations.
“We have recognized the need to be a dynamic company with strong leadership,” Holland and Bresee noted. “We are confident that the changes we are announcing today will make Backcountry stronger, better and ready to forge ahead as the best core gear etailer.”

Description



Description Layfield 3 Piece Table and Floor Lamp Set Bay Isle Home
Layfield 3 Piece Table and Floor Lamp Set Bay Isle Home


The established, Layfield 3 Piece Table and Floor Lamp Set Bay Isle Home based upon exec producer Matt Williams’ property in Cal, isn’t meant to evoke any distinct indoor-design type. ”It’s not Architectural Break down,” admits designer brand David Sackeroff. He with his fantastic staff gleaned most of the Taylor bric-a-brac from flea market segments along with the Disney world prop residence - the style they were concentrating on was classy, not adorned. They have thrown in a few yin-yang details to show Jill and Tim’s personalities - product autos, car posters, and Detroit Lions paraphernalia go go-to-brain having a Michigan Opera mug, towel food bags, and fresh plants. But, oddly, nothing at all in the home is produced by Allen’s cherished Sears - even though Device Time set is a entire other tale.

The Best Way To Layfield 3 Piece Table and Floor Lamp Set Bay Isle Home
 Taylor-Produced: The Taylor house from a front side-row standpoint. ”I wouldn’t precisely refer to it as a style - a lot more like a spot to place your ft . up,” affirms designer David Sackeroff. The set’s homeyness extends to this sort of ”ordinary” particulars like a wall surface-installed Dustbuster, emergency amounts taped next to the mobile phone, plus a drawer filled up with mismatched groups of food.

A peek within the family fridge reveals the normal family staples - fat free yogurt, noodles, leftovers in Tupperware, diet regime soft drink-along with an environmental, if uncommon, touch: outdated-created reusable cup containers for milk. (”Pat (Richardson) definitely would like to show trying to recycle,” affirms Gunn.) Cast and team photographs decorate the fridge. What is underneath the magnet clip? Retailer discount coupons, naturally.

Information Layfield 3 Piece Table and Floor Lamp Set Bay Isle Home

Gas Time: A perfect instance of the Jill/Tim psyches at play. Hers: A demonstrate was written about Jill’s desire for a whole new cusine-area table. Richardson and director Andy Cadiff, after looking at a number of snapshots, chosen this old-fashioned pine kitchen table - which, states establish decorator Jeannie Gunn, possessed ”more figure in comparison to the outdated 1.” His: Not far away from Jill’s things are Tim’s model vehicles (a ’58 Chevy, a ’59 Corvette, and 2 ’89 Lamborghinis), as well as several car publications as well as the baseball reserve This Time in Detroit Tiger History.

Layfield 3 Piece Table and Floor Lamp Set Bay Isle Homeoverall

Flame Power: The vehicle poster higher than the fireplace is undoubtedly an antique, along with the images in stock are of Tim and also the Taylor guys, Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), and Symbol (Taran Noah Smith). In the holidays, Gunn decorates the fire place with greeting greeting cards. The true Allen feel here is the especially produced scale model of a red-colored 1956 Lamborghini Ferrari. ”Tim brought in a catalog using a image of this, and that we ordered it,” affirms Gunn of your numbered unique.
