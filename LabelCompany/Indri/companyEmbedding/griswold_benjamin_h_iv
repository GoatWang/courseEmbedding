New voyages often begin in familiar harbors. Just ask Benjamin H. Griswold IV, who retired last month as the senior chairman of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.Mr. Griswold, 64, represents the seventh generation of his family to have worked at the financial institution, known as Alex. Brown & Sons until it merged with Bankers Trust in 1997. Deutsche Bank bought the combined company two years later.Although he has left the company that his great-great-great-great-grandfather, the Irish-born, Baltimore-based shipping magnate Alexander Brown, founded more than 200 years ago, Mr. Griswold has joined a firm it created and spun off.He was recently named chairman of the two main operating units of Brown Advisory, an investment firm based in Baltimore. It was founded by Alex. Brown & Sons in 1993 and acquired five years later by some former Alex. Brown executives -- including Mr. Griswold.

(Even after helping to found Brown Advisory, he remained at Deutsche Bank Securities, leading a team of 20 investment bankers in deals that included Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of Compaq.) Continue reading the main story

Alex. Brown started in shipping in Baltimore, where its clippers docked with goods from Europe. Members of Mr. Griswold's family were senior partners or chairmen dating to 1800.

"The Brown Advisory offices are located by the harbor, where the clipper ships used to be, so just going to work will be very special for me," he said.The two segments he will run are the Brown Investment Advisory and Trust Company and Brown Advisory Securities. They have a total of 130 employees and manage investment assets of $9 billion, he said.Mr. Griswold, a Princeton graduate with an M.B.A. from Harvard, is a director at three companies: Black & Decker, Flowers Foods and the Baltimore Life Insurance Company.Volunteer work also keeps him busy, especially his role as a trustee of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "I love to say about Johns Hopkins: They assume you don't have a job," he said in describing the workload there.Still, he finds time for his family: his wife, Wendy, eight children and three grandchildren. And he is passionate about steeplechase, owning a dozen horses on his Maryland farm, where competitions are held. "I also do some fox hunting," he said.
