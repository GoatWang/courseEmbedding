Common Questions


















COMMON QUESTIONS






Q: Do I need life insurance?
A: Many people need life insurance for different reasons. If someone relies on your physical or financial support and would financially struggle if you passed away, you may need life insurance. Single individuals, couples (both with and without kids), single parents, stay-at-home parents and small business owners are all candidates for life insurance.


Q: What is the difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance?
A: Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time, whereas permanent life insurance provides coverage for your entire life as long as the policy remains in force.


Q: How much coverage do I need?
A: The amount of coverage you need will vary depending on you and your family's personal needs and budget.
