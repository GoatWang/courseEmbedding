Early Life & Education[edit]
Wei Sun Christianson was born on August 21, 1956 to an army officer father and doctor mother as part of the Frontier Generation from China's Cultural Revolution. She grew up in Beijing as the youngest of four daughters.[1] Growing up, her mother would often sew clothes that were "just a bit more stylish than what was generally available", stimulating Christianson's early interests in fashion.[2] Her parents believed strongly in a Western education, going as far as to spend a month's salary buying her a tape recorder so she could play English tapes. She took the Gao Kao in 1978 and was accepted by the prestigious Beijing Language and Culture University, with the intention of learning English and working as a translator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During college, she met visiting Columbia University professor Randle Edwards and was urged to set her goals higher, aiming to become a lawyer as it would be a more respected profession and highly atypical of women at the time. As she wanted to ultimately attend Columbia Law School, Edwards advised that she first attain a degree from a top liberal arts college in the U.S. in order to better her chances of acceptance.
Christianson applied to a dozen liberal arts colleges in the United States and was accepted to all of them.[1] In 1983 she transferred to Amherst College and became its first student from mainland China following China's opening to the Western world in the early 1980s.[3] She graduated cum laude with a B.A. in political science in 1985.
She immediately continued on to Columbia Law School, where she met her future husband Jon Christianson and received her J.D. degree in international law in 1989.[1][4]
Career[edit]
Following Columbia Law School, Wei Christianson worked as an attorney in the New York offices of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.[5]
In 1992, Christianson and her husband moved to Hong Kong for his job. In order to raise a child (as continuing her law profession in Hong Kong would require her to travel), she attained a position as Associate Director in the Corporate Finance Department at the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) drafting the regulatory structure that would enable the first batch of People's Republic of China companies to be listed outside China — a unique job that helped pave the way for her investment banking career.[5] However, Christianson's husband felt that a career as a regulator did not fully meet Christianson's potential, and suggested pursuing a job in finance instead.[6]
Christianson soon joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, where she was an executive director, Beijing chief representative, and a senior team member of Morgan Stanley's Resources, Power and Transportation Group, where she met her mentor John Mack.[7][1] When Mack was ousted from Morgan Stanley in 2002, Christianson followed him to Credit Suisse First Boston, where he held positions as a managing director, chairman, and country manager.[8] After that, Christianson joined Citigroup as a managing director and chairman of China, Citigroup Global Markets (Asia) Ltd., where she was responsible for the securities and investment banking businesses in China.[7] Christianson returned to Morgan Stanley once again, under Mack's request, in 2006 as the Chief Executive Officer for China, and retains her position there to the present day.[2][9] Since her return, Christianson has built out the Morgan team by 300% and played a critical role in many significant deals for the firm, such as the 2007 $5 billion sale of Morgan Stanley's stakes to China's state-owned China Investment Corporation.[9]
As a banker, Wei has masterminded major initial public offerings including Sinopec, China Life, and SMIC, and oversaw the $4.2 billion acquisition of Gas Khazakstan by CNPC, which was the largest cross-border M&A deal ever undertaken in China at that time.[10]
Wei also serves on the Board of the Estée Lauder Companies. She is also still a member of the Advisory Committee of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, as well as a member of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange’s Strategic Planning Committee.[11] Additionally, Christianson serves on the Board of Trustees of Amherst college.[2]
Awards[edit]
Wei was listed in the Fortune magazine “International Power 50” in 2008 to 2013 and the Top 25 Most Powerful Women in Asia-Pacific in 2014 and 2015.[11] She has also been on Fortune’s “China Powerful Women” list.
Wei is one of the Wall Street Journal 50 Women to Watch of 2006, 2007 and 2008. She is one of the Top 25 Nonbank Women in Finance, 2007 and 2008, rated by American Banker and U.S. Banker. She was one of the 12 Financial Times's “Women of 2013” and was also on the Power Women to Watch list in 2010 and 2011.
Wei was named one of the Top 25 Women in Asian Finance by FinanceAsia magazine in 2015.[12]
Wei received several awards recognizing her achievements as a Chinese native. She received the Pinnacle Award as one of the Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business 2009 by Asian American Business Development Center. She also received the Legacy Award in 2008 by Museum of Chinese in America, and the China Women’s Achievement Award in 2008 by Women’s Federation of P.R. China and Sun Media Group.[4]
Wei was awarded the Medal for Excellence by Columbia University School of Law Association. Christianson was also elected to the prestigious board of The Estée Lauder Companies in 2011, on which she currently serves.[13]
Personal life[edit]
Christianson is famously tight-lipped during interviews, often being elusive about or declining to give information.[6]
She is also known to be well-dressed at all times, and has dabbled in design, participating in the 2015 Women Fashion Power exhibit at the Design Museum in London.[14] She gave an interview with the museum detailing her fashion and beauty habits in which she states that she does not have a personal shopper, and does most of her shopping herself spontaneously while travelling around the world for work. She is very interested in skin care and her favorite designers are: Escada for suits, jeans, Chanel for suits, St. John for suits, Dolce Gabana for pants suits, MaxMara for pants suits, Christin Dior, Fendi for cocktail wear. Roberto Cavali for casual wear. She self describes her style as "professional", and believes that fashion should be an extension of the self, not blindly following trends but rather individualistic and making "a strong statement about one's self esteem, confidence, and presence".[2]
Christianson has stated in multiple interviews that her mother was a major influence growing up. She states that her late mother was the one to support her staying in such a male dominated field even when Christianson felt like giving up.[1] Her mother also spurred on her interests in fashion by tailoring her daughters' clothing and "modestly challenging the Chinese system".[2]
She is married to American Jon Christianson, a former partner of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Affiliates. She has stated that she and her husband split equal responsibilities and support each other in their work and in raising their children, compensating at home for each other's busy work hours.[1] She is also the mother of three boys: Erik, Neil and Nicholas, the eldest of whom is also a graduate of Amherst.[4][1] She currently lives with her family in Beijing.[7]

Early Life & Education[edit]
Wei Sun Christianson was born on August 21, 1956 to an army officer father and doctor mother as part of the Frontier Generation from China's Cultural Revolution. She grew up in Beijing as the youngest of four daughters.[1] Growing up, her mother would often sew clothes that were "just a bit more stylish than what was generally available", stimulating Christianson's early interests in fashion.[2] Her parents believed strongly in a Western education, going as far as to spend a month's salary buying her a tape recorder so she could play English tapes. She took the Gao Kao in 1978 and was accepted by the prestigious Beijing Language and Culture University, with the intention of learning English and working as a translator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During college, she met visiting Columbia University professor Randle Edwards and was urged to set her goals higher, aiming to become a lawyer as it would be a more respected profession and highly atypical of women at the time. As she wanted to ultimately attend Columbia Law School, Edwards advised that she first attain a degree from a top liberal arts college in the U.S. in order to better her chances of acceptance.
Christianson applied to a dozen liberal arts colleges in the United States and was accepted to all of them.[1] In 1983 she transferred to Amherst College and became its first student from mainland China following China's opening to the Western world in the early 1980s.[3] She graduated cum laude with a B.A. in political science in 1985.
She immediately continued on to Columbia Law School, where she met her future husband Jon Christianson and received her J.D. degree in international law in 1989.[1][4]
Career[edit]
Following Columbia Law School, Wei Christianson worked as an attorney in the New York offices of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.[5]
In 1992, Christianson and her husband moved to Hong Kong for his job. In order to raise a child (as continuing her law profession in Hong Kong would require her to travel), she attained a position as Associate Director in the Corporate Finance Department at the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) drafting the regulatory structure that would enable the first batch of People's Republic of China companies to be listed outside China — a unique job that helped pave the way for her investment banking career.[5] However, Christianson's husband felt that a career as a regulator did not fully meet Christianson's potential, and suggested pursuing a job in finance instead.[6]
Christianson soon joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, where she was an executive director, Beijing chief representative, and a senior team member of Morgan Stanley's Resources, Power and Transportation Group, where she met her mentor John Mack.[7][1] When Mack was ousted from Morgan Stanley in 2002, Christianson followed him to Credit Suisse First Boston, where he held positions as a managing director, chairman, and country manager.[8] After that, Christianson joined Citigroup as a managing director and chairman of China, Citigroup Global Markets (Asia) Ltd., where she was responsible for the securities and investment banking businesses in China.[7] Christianson returned to Morgan Stanley once again, under Mack's request, in 2006 as the Chief Executive Officer for China, and retains her position there to the present day.[2][9] Since her return, Christianson has built out the Morgan team by 300% and played a critical role in many significant deals for the firm, such as the 2007 $5 billion sale of Morgan Stanley's stakes to China's state-owned China Investment Corporation.[9]
As a banker, Wei has masterminded major initial public offerings including Sinopec, China Life, and SMIC, and oversaw the $4.2 billion acquisition of Gas Khazakstan by CNPC, which was the largest cross-border M&A deal ever undertaken in China at that time.[10]
Wei also serves on the Board of the Estée Lauder Companies. She is also still a member of the Advisory Committee of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, as well as a member of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange’s Strategic Planning Committee.[11] Additionally, Christianson serves on the Board of Trustees of Amherst college.[2]
Awards[edit]
Wei was listed in the Fortune magazine “International Power 50” in 2008 to 2013 and the Top 25 Most Powerful Women in Asia-Pacific in 2014 and 2015.[11] She has also been on Fortune’s “China Powerful Women” list.
Wei is one of the Wall Street Journal 50 Women to Watch of 2006, 2007 and 2008. She is one of the Top 25 Nonbank Women in Finance, 2007 and 2008, rated by American Banker and U.S. Banker. She was one of the 12 Financial Times's “Women of 2013” and was also on the Power Women to Watch list in 2010 and 2011.
Wei was named one of the Top 25 Women in Asian Finance by FinanceAsia magazine in 2015.[12]
Wei received several awards recognizing her achievements as a Chinese native. She received the Pinnacle Award as one of the Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business 2009 by Asian American Business Development Center. She also received the Legacy Award in 2008 by Museum of Chinese in America, and the China Women’s Achievement Award in 2008 by Women’s Federation of P.R. China and Sun Media Group.[4]
Wei was awarded the Medal for Excellence by Columbia University School of Law Association. Christianson was also elected to the prestigious board of The Estée Lauder Companies in 2011, on which she currently serves.[13]
Personal life[edit]
Christianson is famously tight-lipped during interviews, often being elusive about or declining to give information.[6]
She is also known to be well-dressed at all times, and has dabbled in design, participating in the 2015 Women Fashion Power exhibit at the Design Museum in London.[14] She gave an interview with the museum detailing her fashion and beauty habits in which she states that she does not have a personal shopper, and does most of her shopping herself spontaneously while travelling around the world for work. She is very interested in skin care and her favorite designers are: Escada for suits, jeans, Chanel for suits, St. John for suits, Dolce Gabana for pants suits, MaxMara for pants suits, Christin Dior, Fendi for cocktail wear. Roberto Cavali for casual wear. She self describes her style as "professional", and believes that fashion should be an extension of the self, not blindly following trends but rather individualistic and making "a strong statement about one's self esteem, confidence, and presence".[2]
Christianson has stated in multiple interviews that her mother was a major influence growing up. She states that her late mother was the one to support her staying in such a male dominated field even when Christianson felt like giving up.[1] Her mother also spurred on her interests in fashion by tailoring her daughters' clothing and "modestly challenging the Chinese system".[2]
She is married to American Jon Christianson, a former partner of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Affiliates. She has stated that she and her husband split equal responsibilities and support each other in their work and in raising their children, compensating at home for each other's busy work hours.[1] She is also the mother of three boys: Erik, Neil and Nicholas, the eldest of whom is also a graduate of Amherst.[4][1] She currently lives with her family in Beijing.[7]

She is very interested in skin care and her favorite designers are: Escada for suits, jeans, Chanel for suits, St. John for suits, Dolce Gabana for pants suits, MaxMara for pants suits, Christin Dior, Fendi for cocktail wear. Roberto Cavali for casual wear. She self describes her style as "professional", and believes that fashion should be an extension of the self, not blindly following trends but rather individualistic and making "a strong statement about one's self esteem, confidence, and presence".[2]
Christianson has stated in multiple interviews that her mother was a major influence growing up. She states that her late mother was the one to support her staying in such a male dominated field even when Christianson felt like giving up.[1] Her mother also spurred on her interests in fashion by tailoring her daughters' clothing and "modestly challenging the Chinese system".[2]
She is married to American Jon Christianson, a former partner of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Affiliates. She has stated that she and her husband split equal responsibilities and support each other in their work and in raising their children, compensating at home for each other's busy work hours.[1] She is also the mother of three boys: Erik, Neil and Nicholas, the eldest of whom is also a graduate of Amherst.[4][1] She currently lives with her family in Beijing.[7]

Introduction



Wei Sun Christianson is CEO of China and Co-CEO of Asia Pacific for Morgan Stanley and a member of the firm’s Management Committee. Under her leadership, Morgan Stanley has broadened its onshore footprint in China to include domestic securities and bonds underwriting, commercial banking, asset management, trust services and renminbi-denominated private equity investing. She is based in Beijing.

Wei first joined Morgan Stanley in 1998, working in the firm’s Investment Banking Division. She graduated cum laude from Amherst College and earned her J.D. degree from the Columbia University School of Law.




Did you always want a career in finance?



My ambition was to work in a profession that is respected. In China, at that time, it was normal for a woman to work, but women working in a core role in a highly respected profession were rare.

A Columbia law professor who visited my Chinese college once told me that lawyers, accountants and doctors were considered amongst the most respected professionals in the US I had a clear picture that I wanted to be a lawyer. I decided to repeat my last two years of college at a US liberal arts college, Amherst. I got into Columbia and Harvard law schools, but Columbia gave me a full grant. My parents told me to never owe anyone any money, so I went to Columbia.

I later became a lawyer in New York with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. And then, in the early 1990s, I moved to Hong Kong and joined the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the local regulator, where I helped formulate the regulations to prepare for the Hong Kong public listings of the first group of Mainland Chinese companies. I realized then that the equity market in China was likely to emerge at a rapid pace and would be an exciting and dynamic area to work. That’s when I wanted to make the move into finance.




How has your experience outside of the financial services industry affected the way you approach your role at the firm?



Given the complexities and challenges of my Asia and China roles, I couldn’t do my job without that legal and liberal arts education. It taught me to identify and analyze issues, maintain clarity and provide solutions.

My legal training also made me sensitive and vigilant to potential issues that the firm could face. Ensuring we do the right thing and protecting the Morgan Stanley franchise in the region are critical priorities for us.




How does our value of putting clients first impact our China franchise’s growth?



Every investment bank has a presence here in China, but in many ways Morgan Stanley is set apart. We were often called “the first person to eat the crab”(第一个吃螃蟹的人). This expression means that one is really a trendsetter.

We formed China's first foreign investment bank joint venture in 1995 with China Construction Bank. That experience generated tremendous goodwill for us in China as we were teaching them how to build an international company.

We’ve been at the forefront of China’s capital markets since the early 1990s and have a lot to be proud of. Morgan Stanley led the first deal to be marketed outside of China in 1991, even before the stock exchanges existed. In 1992, we completed the first Yankee bond for a Chinese issuer.

A lot of the early state-owned enterprise deals were truly groundbreaking, and we had outsized market share. This included helping our partner, China Construction Bank, become the first bank in China to go public. We were also the first to start private equity investing in China and to focus more generally on private companies. This led to us underwriting many of the most significant China private sector listings.




How would you describe the firm’s culture?



When I considered returning to Morgan Stanley, I asked myself: Is Morgan Stanley me and am I Morgan Stanley? Of course it was not a long debate. The collaborative culture here is very appealing, and, of course, the quality of the team. They could have simply brought me in to run investment banking for China, but the firm is especially good at seeing other possibilities. This further convinced me that this was the place I belonged.

It’s challenging to build a franchise like Morgan Stanley in a new cultural environment. We first had to build the framework—a core team to be the culture carriers for the firm. We have deliberately put people in place who aren’t always Asian or Chinese. The China management team includes quite a few people who have been with the firm a long time, who bring a variety of perspectives. We benefit not only from their skill set and management experience, but also from their knowledge of what Morgan Stanley stands for. They are important role models for younger and newer employees.




What is the most fulfilling aspect about your work?



I love the fact that I can directly impact Chinese companies or American or European clients. There are great potential synergies for so many global companies and fantastic ideas to help them expand their businesses in China. I can immediately see the value my team and I can add.

What’s so exciting is that your work makes a difference beyond yourself. You’re really helping others, and have access to so many brilliant business leaders. They are all inspiring, and yet, we are able to help them fulfill their ambitions in one of the most important and dynamic markets in the world.

Since taking the reins of the firm’s Chinese operations in 2005, Christianson has helped Morgan Stanley do deals worth $293 billion over the past decade. A key player in Alibaba’s $25 billion IPO last year, she is now building the bank’s e-commerce presence in the country. The outspoken women’s rights advocate, a member of the Estée Lauder board, is also an influential voice overseas. And a recent “Women Fashion Power” exhibit at the Design Museum in London showcased one of her outfits—along with those of Diane von Furstenberg and Lady Gaga. —Rupali Arora

CHINA’S SLOWDOWN: The Positive Ripple Effect 
In 2015, China ended a 30-year period of high-speed growth. How is China’s slowing economy impacting global business? Could this new moment of decline signal even greater opportunities? We’ll talk to women leading companies across China about how they are navigating—and capitalizing on— this period of wrenching change. Discussion leaders:
Wei Sun Christianson, Co-CEO, Asia-Pacific, and China CEO, Morgan Stanley
Yilu Zhao, Senior Advisor, Qunar and Co-founder, Zebra Global Capital
Moderator: Nina Easton, Fortune
Peter Dench — Fortune Most Powerful Women


Christianson, one of Asia’s most influential dealmakers, has reaped an IPO windfall for the bank, underwriting 127 Chinese firms’ IPOs since she became CEO in 2005 (including 13 IPOs last year alone). This makes  Morgan Stanley the No. 1 bank in equity offerings in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) so far this year. One highlight in May: the $1.1 billion Hong Kong IPO of BOC Aviation, the largest ever IPO of a leasing company globally.  The U.S. educated lawyer-turned-banker, who started her Morgan Stanley career as a Beijing representative in 1998, has also crushed it in China’s booming M&A market, negotiating 44 deals worth $110 billion in 2015. The member of the bank’s global management committee is also advocating for diversity in the workplace and championing for women’s rights across the globe.

Q&A







How closely do you follow fashion?
Design Museum


I have strong interests in fashion.  My job provides me with unique opportunities to get to know CEOs, business owners and fashion designers globally.  I also have the fortune to be friend a few of them.  I subscribe to a number of fashion magazines to keep myself updated.  As I don’t have much time for it when I am working, so I splurge when I am on the plane travelling or when I am on vacation or holiday.
Wei Sun Christianson


Do you read a fashion magazine on a regular basis?
Design Museum


Kind of.  Please see above.
Wei Sun Christianson


Do you consult fashion blogs?
Design Museum


Rarely.
Wei Sun Christianson


When did you become aware of fashion?
Design Museum


I grew up in China during the Culture Revolution period.  Fashion and stylish clothes were considered bourgeois and non-revolutionary which could land you in big trouble including jail.  My mother who was a Communist Party official, however, didn’t entirely subscribe to this line of thinking.  Although she had to wear military uniform or plain blue or grey jackets, she used to wear high heels with permed stylish hair before Culture Revolution.  She suffered a great deal during culture revolution and one of the major criticism was her life style.  After she became partly paralyzed as the result of mass criticism and torture, my mother picked up sewing partly as an exercise of her hands, partly to sew for us clothes that were just a bit more stylish than what was generally available, but not over done to get us into trouble.  So while from the outside, we may have all been wearing military outfit or drab Mao suits during the Culture Revolution, I always felt a bit more stylish than my classmates.  I think my search for style has its origins in my mother’s strong desire to look at her best and to modestly challenge the Chinese system.
Wei Sun Christianson


How would you describe your relationship with clothes?
Design Museum


Although we should not be defined by the clothes we wear, I believe what we wear is the extension of ourselves.  I select my clothes very carefully so I hold strong sentimental value to my clothes as it often reminds of how I was at certain period of time of my life.
Wei Sun Christianson


When did you develop your own ‘style’ - do you feel that you have one - what is your basic 'look'?
Design Museum


As a dedicated professional woman who was a lawyer, securities regulator, till now a senior banker and senior executive, most of my clothes is the office wear with the professional touch.
Wei Sun Christianson


Do you have a preference for particular shapes, colours, fabrics or textures?
Design Museum


I like quality tailored suits that enhance femininity.   I love variety of colors or textures, but floral prints do not suit me.
Wei Sun Christianson


Who are your favourite designers and why (historical and contemporary)?
Design Museum


Escada for suits, jeans, Chanel for suits, St. John for suits, Dolce Gabana for pants suits, MaxMara for pants suits, Christin Dior, Fendi for cocktail wear.  Roberto Cavali for casual wear. For Chinese traditional outfit, I wear Shanghai Xu tailored qipao and I start to wear a young Chinese designer Xia Zi Chen’s cocktail dress.
Wei Sun Christianson


Do you use a personal shopper?
Design Museum


No.  I like the experience of buying my own clothes.  It is about knowing yourself.  Trying different things is part of the fun.
Wei Sun Christianson


How much do you involve your partner in clothes buying?
Design Museum


He does not care much to shop with me, but he is a great sounding board for helping me choose the right clothes for different occasions.  He is particularly helpful on choosing jewellery - he should be good at it since he has purchased virtually all my jewellery for me.
Wei Sun Christianson


What percentage of your income goes on clothes purchases annually?
Design Museum


I never go on dedicated shopping trips.  I shop when I have time and am in the mood for it. Often during business trips in NYC, Paris, London when I have a few hours free time.  I am not an outrage spender on clothes, but I want to make sure each piece of my clothes suits me and is high quality.
Wei Sun Christianson


How many pairs of shoes or handbags do you have?
Design Museum


That is the secret that I would like to keep to myself.
Wei Sun Christianson


How important is hair and make-up to you?
Design Museum


I believe hair is as important as one’s outfit.  I pay a lot of attention to my hair and get my hair washed mostly at the hair salon, partly because I really value a hair style that I feel fits my personality, but also because my hair salon is a place where I can relax and unwind.  Skin care is something I take seriously and always constantly in search of better products.  As a board member for Estee Lauder Group, I am fortunate to have great access to the best skincare, makeup and hair products.  I love to collect makeup products from various brands (especially the brands under Estee Lauder).  However, I do not wear much make up during a regular business day.  Because I am always on the run, even when I apply on more make up for especial occasions, I tend to do my makeup in the car.  Having a driver in an environment with a lot of traffic jam, is a huge benefit.
Wei Sun Christianson


Do you buy seasonally or when the need or mood dictates?
Design Museum


I only shop when I have time and am in the mood.  So my shopping is entirely unpredictable and spontaneous.
Wei Sun Christianson


Is there a difference between your public and private wardrobe - if so, what are the reasons behind this?
Design Museum


Absolutely. My public wardrobe is about professional style and presentation.  My private wardrobe is less formal and comfort with style.
Wei Sun Christianson


How do you view fashion and clothes in relation to your professional standing?
Design Museum


When I started in the financial services sector at a law firm in New York City, I wore very conservative outfits - dark suits with long skirts.  They had a kind of masculine feel to them.  When I moved to Hong Kong, I started to work at the Securities and Futures Commission.  I noticed that HK professional women tend to wear  more bright-colored business suits.  This inspired me.  During those years, I found I liked color and texture and cut.  I decided that while I was working in a man’s world, I was not going to suppress my femininity in an attempt to blend in.  I was fortunate to have bosses that cared more about performance and substance than conformity. I hope that I can inspire other women in my profession to express their style and individuality through what they chose to wear and how they wear it.
Wei Sun Christianson


To what extent does your professional role inform your fashion choices?
Design Museum


My role as the CEO of the regional business provides me with access to senior government and corporate clients all over the world. Therefore, the good exposure to these caliber of people helps me to refine my style from time to time.
Wei Sun Christianson


Does fashion empower you? What outfit would most empower you and why?
Design Museum


Fashion absolutely empowers me. I believe fashion can be a secret weapon for not just women but also for men.  A right outfit can be a strong statement about one’s self esteem, confidence and presence.  For me, as a senior executive/banker, business suits (whether pants suits or skirt suits) help me to deliver the image and message.
Wei Sun Christianson


What does fashion in the future need to do to help women / to empower them?
Design Museum


I think the key is not necessarily for the fashion industry to design more stylish clothes but to help women to cultivate their own taste/style that is best suited for them.  Often times, I find women chasing for the latest fad without the judgment whether it suits them.  In addition, fashion is about full presentation from head to toe, therefore, women need to be educated about how to match clothes with the right hair style, the makeup and the accessories.
