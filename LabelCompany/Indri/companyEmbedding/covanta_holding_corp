					Full Description



Covanta Holding Corporation, incorporated on April 16, 1992, is a holding company. The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates infrastructure for the conversion of waste to energy, as well as other waste disposal and renewable energy production businesses. The Company operates through North America segment, which consists of waste and energy services operations located primarily in the United States and Canada. Outside of North America, the Company is constructing an energy-from-waste (EfW) facility in Dublin, Ireland. The Company holds interests in an EfW facility in Italy and an infrastructure business in China, which is engaged in EfW operations.The Company processed approximately 20 million tons of solid waste annually. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated and/or had ownership positions in 42 EfW facilities, which are primarily located in North America, and five additional energy generation facilities, including other renewable energy production facilities in North America (wood biomass and hydroelectric). In total, these assets produce approximately 10 million megawatt hours (MWh) of baseload electricity annually. The Company also operated waste management infrastructure, including 17 waste transfer stations, 15 environmental services facilities, four landfills (primarily for ash disposal) and one metals processing facility, as of December 31, 2016.The Company's EfW projects generate revenue from three main sources: fees charged for operating projects or processing waste received; the sale of electricity and/or steam, and the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous metals that are recovered from the waste stream as part of the EfW process. The Company also generates additional revenue from the construction, expansion or upgrade of a facility, when a municipal client owns the facility. Its customers for waste services or facility operations are principally municipal entities, though the Company also markets disposal capacity at certain facilities to commercial customers. Its facilities primarily sell electricity, either to utilities at contracted rates or, in situations where a contract is not in place, at prevailing market rates in regional markets (primarily PJM, New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) and New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) in the Northeastern United States), and in some cases sell steam directly to industrial users.The Company's EfW projects can be divided into three categories, based on the applicable contract structure at a project: Tip Fee projects; Service Fee projects that it owns, and Service Fee projects that it does not own but operate on behalf of a municipal owner. The Company also operates and/or have ownership positions in environmental services businesses, transfer stations and landfills (primarily for ash disposal) that are ancillary and complementary to its EfW projects and generate additional revenue from disposal or service fees.

Interesting CVA Put And Call Options For August 18th













CVA: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 05/31/2017 settlement date, and Covanta Holding Corp is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 16.86 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.01. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

MORRISTOWN, N.J., March 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Covanta Holding Corporation (NYSE:    CVA) (the "Company" or "Covanta"), today announced the pricing of its underwritten registered public offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 (the "Note Offering").  Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on January 1 and July 1, beginning on July 1, 2017; the notes will mature on July 1, 2025.  The notes will be issued at 100% of par value, with a coupon of 5.875%.  The offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on October 24, 2014, subject to certain closing conditions.








The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Note Offering along with cash on hand and/or direct borrowings under Covanta Energy, LLC's revolving credit facility to fund the redemption of all of its 7.25% Senior Notes due 2020 on April 3, 2017 (the "Redemption Date") and to pay transaction fees and expenses and accrued interest. In the period between the closing of the Note Offering and the Redemption Date, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the Note Offering to repay borrowings outstanding under Covanta Energy, LLC's revolving credit facility in an amount up to $152 million and invest the remaining net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing accounts, securities or similar investments. 
J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Agricole CIB, Citizens Capital Markets, Inc. and MUFG acted as joint bookrunning managers in the Note Offering.  A copy of the prospectus supplement and prospectus relating to these securities may be obtained, when available, by contacting J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, New York, 11717, or by calling +1 (866) 803-9204.
This press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy or sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy or sell with respect to any securities. The Note Offering may be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The prospectus is part of a shelf registration statement that has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Note Offering is not being made in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction or is otherwise prohibited. In addition, this press release does not constitute an offer to redeem or a solicitation of an offer to redeem the existing notes.

                Zero Waste & Materials Management Services
            



























Whether you’ve set a goal of zero waste, zero landfill, sustainable materials management (SMM), diversion or achieving a circular economy, the end results are similar; lower environmental impacts from how we manage waste and materials. Covanta can help you attract the most value from your waste resources, benefiting both the environment and your bottom line.
 
With decades of experience in implementing responsible waste reduction strategies, Covanta offers a team of experts who will work with you to identify the best reduce, reuse, recycle, recover options for your production and manufacturing by-products. Our consultants have performed opportunity assessments on many organizations, large and small, in order to improve their environmental footprint, reduce costs, uncover new revenue streams and mitigate risk, all while protecting brand reputations. We collect independent research on an ongoing basis and always make sure our processes are efficient and effective, from both environmental and economic standpoints.
The consulting services we offer include:


Site investigation and remediation services, such as:

Environmental site assessments
UST Tank Removal


Environmental compliance support:

Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans
Facility Response plans (FRP)
Discharge Monitoring reports (DMRs)
Hazardous Waste Management Plans (HWMPs) and other RCRA support
Pollution Prevention (P2) plans


Zero waste to landfill and waste minimization consulting
Current environmental permit reviews
Facility evaluation and annual routine reporting for EPA and state-mandated environmental EPCRA, Right to Know, RCRA, CWA, and CERCLA reporting requirements

Not only can Covanta help organizations with planning and consulting, we also deliver on our recommendations. We operate a diverse fleet of materials processing, wastewater treatment, e-waste recycling, depackaging and energy recovery facilities that can deliver full solutions. With our extensive network of relationships, we can expand our reach to composting, anaerobic digestion, industrial reuse and logistical options to provide a full suite of services.
Once you are up and running, Covanta provides ongoing support. For those who require third party certification of zero landfill or zero-waste-to-landfill, our GreenCircle-certified Zero-Waste-to-Landfill process provides documentation, process proof and internal certifications for receipt and processing of waste materials. We can also help you understand the impacts and benefits of the waste services provided, whether to support your GHG inventory, reach your sustainability goals, meet your supply chain requirements or analyze your full product lifecycle.



Reduce
Covanta knows that helping organizations move up the waste hierarchy will reduce their impact on the environment and move them toward their goal of zero waste. 

We are continually striving to find the optimum resolution to any environmental issue. 
As a high-level, full service business, we take pride in providing turnkey solutions to manage the disposition of any waste stream.
We conduct waste auditing to help our customers identify waste reduction and recycling opportunities across their organization.

Reuse
Our wastewater treatment process is a prime component of our efforts to reuse resources.

We treat industrial and commercial wastewaters using a variety of approaches customized for each wastewater, including pH adjustment, flocculation, filtration, and oil/water separation. The treated water is then sent to municipal treatment plants for final water treatment and reintroduction to the water cycle. 
Acids and caustics are recovered and reused for future treatment of wastewater.
Clean oil products are recovered for off-site reuse or fuel blending.

Recycle
We facilitate recycling of many materials, and our methods are recovering more source materials every year:

Our UnWrapp process converts packaged products into recyclable commodities, water, and energy. 
We recycle 13 million pounds of e-waste annually.

Recover
We own and/or operate over 40 Energy-from-Waste facilities in North America that generate clean and renewable baseload electricity and/or steam from residential, commercial and industrial wastes. These facilities are an excellent complement to your recycling and waste reduction programs as they are far preferable to landfilling those wastes that cannot be practically or economically recycled or source reduced. In addition, most facilities recover both ferrous and non-ferrous metals. We also provide complete secure destruction services, including witnessed destruction, at our energy recovery facilities to help mitigate your downstream risks.
Dispose 
When it comes to non-hazardous waste, everything we receive from our customers is either reused, recycled or processed through our energy recovery systems. 
The on-site services we offer include: 

Sludge removal 
Wet and dry industrial vacuuming
Water blasting
Line jetting
Dewatering
Tank removal and decommissioning for both underground and above-ground storage tanks
Sewer line maintenance and cleaning
Plant cleanouts and closures 

Our dedicated logistics experts will help you find the most cost-effective bulking and transportation options and we offer on-site collection, conveyance and management services. We accept a wide range of containers, including boxes, drums, IBCs, totes, super sacks and pallets, and have a network of wastewater and solid material processing facilities throughout the midwestern and eastern United States. We take a variety of waste types and offer waste management solutions such as shredding, solidification, stabilization and more.
Finally, as a company providing waste & materials management services, we know how important it is to practice what we preach:

We operate several zero-process water discharge plants throughout the United States, reducing the generation of wastewater. 
We collect and recovery mercury, keeping it out the waste stream.
We are expanding our use of carbide lime (a by-product of acetylene manufacturing), ash from our combustion plants and ammonia in our ongoing pollution control processes.
Metals recovery has increased by 40%, stainless steel can now be recovered from ash, and mixed metals are now processed into purer commodity streams.

We are constantly researching and advancing new ideas to help you meet your sustainability goals. With our decades of experience and a consultative approach, we have helped many clients find the best solution for their needs.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
