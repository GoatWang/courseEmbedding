Crestwood-based biotech company Liberate Medical LLC wants to help people breathe a little easier.
And it's doing that by developing two products for people with respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Flare-ups can hit suddenly, and they range from mild to life-threatening — and sometimes they put patients in the hospital with a machine breathing for them.

"Even after they're removed from the ventilator, patients need help breathing for themselves," CEO Angus McLachlan said. Just as astronauts lose muscle mass when they aren't fighting the effects of gravity, "it's the same with ventilation."
Vent free
The first product is a medical device called Vent Free. The idea is to use electrical charges to stimulate the muscles so they contract, preventing muscle loss or restoring muscle strength lost while a patient was on a ventilator.
Liberate has a working prototype and soon will enter two 20-patient clinical trials — the last stage before Liberate submits the technology to the FDA for approval.




One trial, in Holland, will test the effects of using Vent Free to prevent muscle deterioration while patients are on a ventilator. The other trial, in Louisville, will test whether the product can rebuild strength in those muscles after patients have been on a ventilator for a few weeks.
Vent Free would be marketed directly to hospitals. Liberate already has plans to work with one local hospital system, but McLachlan said he could not identify it because of a non-disclosure agreement.
Second breath
The second product, called "Second Breath," is a portable device that tackles another issue: hyperinflation, which occurs when the airway narrows and air becomes trapped in the lungs. That's a problem because air builds up with every breath and the lungs become too full.
Second Breath uses electrical charges to force the abdominal muscles to contract, which would squeeze the lungs and push out air. The device likely would be administered by prescription only, to be worn on the hip during day-to-day activities, McLachlan said.

When we wrote about Liberate a few years ago, the company already was working with the University of Louisville on clinical trials, and leaders were starting to think about manufacturing.
Liberate now is vetting manufacturers and distributors for the device, as required for the FDA approval process. Doing so helps ensure that the design could be easily and cost-effectively produced and distributed, McLachlan said.




 


For both Liberate products, he thinks the profits could be "substantial, but the proof is sort of in the pudding." And, of course, it depends on whether those products receive FDA approval and make it to market — which can be an expensive process.
Going to market
For medical devices, it can take two to three years and as much as $20 million to support development just to reach pre-clinical testing, according to a 2010 paper from California Polytechnic State University, "Mapping the Medical Device Development Process."
Liberate currently receives funding through a mixed bag of private sources, matching grants from the state of Kentucky, the National Science Foundation and other government organizations. McLachlan declined to say how much funding the company has received.
If Liberate's products do make it to market, promotion initially would focus on the U.S. and Europe. "But the technology could be applicable to the rest of the world," McLachlan said, although there are no firm plans to target any other markets yet.
Liberate was founded about three years ago as a spinoff of Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Crestwood-based pharmaceutical company ( which also has some interesting stuff going on). I wrote earlier this week about an app being developed by another Apellis spinoff, Revon Systems Inc.
The company has three employees, including McLachlan, all of whom are engineers. Liberate also uses subcontractors to do some work.
Liberate Medical is a graduate of the XLerate Health business accelerator program and already has racked up prestigious local awards, including being listed among Greater Louisville Inc.'s 'Hot Dozen' of fast-growing companies.

Helping Patients Take Their Next Breath

 


VentFree
A respiratory electrical muscle stimulator that is designed to reduce the number of days a patient spends on mechanical ventilation.




Clinical Background
Over one million patients in the United States (US) are estimated to undergo mechanical ventilation (MV) every year. Approximately half of them have difficulty weaning from MV, and many end up requiring prolonged ventilator support. In the US, the overall health-care cost of these patients in the acute care setting is estimated to be more than $16 billion annually. Furthermore, patients requiring prolonged MV are susceptible to a wide range of clinical complications and excess mortality. The current standard of care to wean patients requiring prolonged MV is to have them undergo daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). These trials are carried out using a variety of strategies intended to progressively reduce the extent of MV support while, concurrently, reconditioning the respiratory muscles weakened during the preceding pre-weaning period of MV. This process can last between days and months. In the most severe of cases, patients may never wean from MV. Unfortunately, there are presently no medical devices or medications that can accelerate the process of weaning from MV and reduce the number of ventilator-dependent patients.
How can VentFree Help?
VentFree is an electrotherapy device that applies stimulation to the abdominal wall muscles in synchrony with mechanical ventilation. It is being designed to reduce the time to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. VentFree is not available for sale in the United States. Check back here in the coming months for more updates on the product.
