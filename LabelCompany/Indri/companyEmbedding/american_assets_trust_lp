CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY










				Environmental Sustainability


				Social Responsibility










		American Assets Trust, Inc. is a dedicated steward of our community and our environment. Together with our community partners, we have developed and incorporated into our business practices innovative programs to promote environmental sustainability and social responsibility.


 

 




		Environmental Sustainability


			Protecting the earth’s natural resources is a top priority for American Assets Trust, Inc. In operating and developing our properties, we use proven conservation methods to reduce carbon emissions, repair environmental damage, and preserve natural resources for this and future generations. We have implemented internal sustainability guidelines developed by experts in the ﬁeld of sustainability.

			In addition to implementing environmentally friendly changes, in conjunction with Pacific Gas & Electric and Silicon Valley Environment Committee, members of our team presented Energy Conservation Programs and Water Conservation Programs, respectively, to other companies in the commercial real estate community and committee members.  Using the knowledge we have gained through the years in operating and developing our properties, we presented adopted systems and processes that are viable for commercial real estate.  We hope that in sharing our knowledge, our neighbors will adopt changes that have an overall positive impact on the environment.

			Below are just some of our specific accomplishments aimed toward sustainability:



					Portfolio Wide



							Portfolio-wide LED retrofitting project at many of our office and retail properties.   The high-efficiency and extended-lifespan LED lights are controlled using smart control systems, including Building Automation System and telematics controls.  The controls automatically adjust the lighting needs according to natural sunrise and sunset schedules instead of manual timers.



							Installation of electric vehicle charging stations at many of our properties with additional units slated to be installed.



							Installation of ultra-water efficient fixtures and appliances.



							Adaptive and environmentally sensitive landscaping, including drought-tolerant plants.



							E-Waste programs, including annual free Earth Day E-Waste drive for tenants and employees.





					First & Main – LEED Platinum Certified, the highest LEED certification rating.






						City Center Bellevue



								LEED Gold-EBOM Certified.



								Implemented a construction waste diversion program.  Construction waste as a result of tenant improvement projects must be recycled or diverted, to the extent possible, away from the landfill.



								Installed rain water collection tank for exterior landscaping.







						Landmark – The 5th building in San Francisco to implement the Waste-to-Energy program.  The Waste-to-Energy program processes dirty HVAC filters by diverting them away from the landfill and transferring them to an off-site combustion chamber facility.  The filters are then burned at high temperatures resulting in a residual product of less than 10% of its original volume.  The heat generated from the combustion chambers heats water in steel tubes that form the walls of the combustion chamber to create steam.  The steam powers the turbine that continuously generates electricity which, in turn, is fed back into the grid.  For every 2,000 lbs. of waste, 520 kWh of electricity is generated, powering homes and businesses in Northern California. 





						Embassy Suites at Waikiki Beach Walk – Variable Frequency Drive Motor HVAC system.





						Lloyd District Portfolio:



								Easy access to multiple public transportation rails.  Including on-site terminals for the Portland Streetcar and the Max Light Rail System with a direct route to Portland International Airport and other destinations throughout Portland.  The Lloyd properties are also situated at the main city access for bicycles commuting from North and East Portland.



								Hassalo on Eighth



										On track for LEED Platinum Certification for Homes and New Development upon completion of the project



										Nation’s largest and first multi-family National Organic Recycling Machine (or NORM) treating 100% of the grey and black water created by each of the three residential buildings, and the Lloyd 700 Office building, amounting to approximately 47,000 gallons of wastewater diverted from the municipal sewer system daily.  NORM doesn't generate any waste of its own: bio-solids are used for fertilizer off-site, and fats, oils and greases are used for fuel off-site as well.  NORM is expected to reduce water usage for the four buildings by 50%, or approximately 7,300,000 gallons, of water per year.



										Eco-Roofs to assist in storm water mitigation.



										Bike Hub with over 1,000 bike stalls, plus lockers and shower facilities.



										Food composting program for residence and office tenants.









						California Portfolio



								Transitioning from traditional irrigation systems to eco-friendly reclaimed irrigation systems to maintain our award winning landscaping while reducing water consumption.  Properties where established municipal lines collect and treat gray water will use the reclaimed water to irrigate our landscaping, resulting in a reduction of our fresh potable water needs.



								Implemented one of the largest and most comprehensive recycling programs in San Diego for our entire Southern California portfolio.  Our Northern California property, Del Monte Center, implemented a comprehensive glass bottles, cans and cardboard boxes recycling program.







						Torrey Reserve Campus:



								Variable Frequency Drives on all Cooling Tower HVAC systems.



								Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program.



								GENEA – HVAC control system with an on-demand use option.   This eliminates the necessity of cooling empty buildings.



								Energy Star Certified.



								Parking canopy and rooftop photovoltaic systems (solar energy) generating up to 500 kWh, reducing the overall electrical consumption needs of the campus.



								Phase III and IV of the development recycled an estimated 75% of the construction waste or approximately 90,000 SF of waste.





				In addition, sustainability is a major focus of our active development project:


			Torrey Point Development: The Torrey Point development, formerly known as Sorrento Pointe, has finally commenced after 17 years of entitlement efforts!    The project is situated in one of San Diego’s premier locations with panoramic views of the Torrey Pines State Park Beach and Reserve and the Pacific Ocean.  With that, our design team incorporated green elements to blend with the surrounding habitat and wetlands, all the while taking advantage of the breathtaking views.   We are committed to obtaining U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the buildings, including the addition of electric vehicle charging stations. 

			We are proud of our accomplishments thus far and will continue our efforts to develop and retrofit sustainable properties.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements   our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness;   defaults on, early terminations of or non-renewal of leases by tenants, including significant tenants;   difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;   difficulties in completing dispositions;   our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations;   our inability to develop or redevelop our properties due to market conditions;   fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs;   risks related to joint venture arrangements;   our failure to obtain necessary outside financing;   on-going litigation;   general economic conditions;   financial market fluctuations;   risks that affect the general retail, office, multifamily and mixed-use environment;   the competitive environment in which we operate;   decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;   conflicts of interests with our officers or directors;   lack or insufficient amounts of insurance;   environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;   other factors affecting the real estate industry generally;   limitations imposed on our business and our ability to satisfy complex rules in order for us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and   changes in governmental regulations or interpretations thereof, such as real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates and taxation of REITs.  While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors,  Table of Contents  new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other factors, see the section entitled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" contained herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Same-store  We have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be important measures because they assist in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance. While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties into same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Our evaluation of significant impact related to development, redevelopment or expansion activity is based on quantitative and qualitative measures including, but not limited to the following: the total budgeted cost of planned construction activity compared to the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and property operating income within the calendar year; percentage of development, redevelopment or expansion square footage to total property square footage; and the ability to maintain historic occupancy and rental rates. In consideration of these measures, we generally remove properties from same-store properties when we see a decline in a property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year as a direct result of ongoing redevelopment, development or expansion activity. Acquired properties are classified into same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion.  Table of Contents  In our determination of same-store and redevelopment same-store properties, Torrey Reserve Campus has been identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant construction activity. Office same-store net operating income increased approximately 5.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Office redevelopment same-store net operating income increased approximately 3.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  Below is a summary of our same-store composition for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Lloyd District Portfolio was transferred into same-store properties due to the completion of development activity at Hassalo on Eighth. Hassalo on Eighth - Retail was included in non-same store properties when compared to the designations for the three months ended March 31, 2016. One development property, Torrey Reserve Land, was removed from development properties when compared to the designations for the three months ended March 31, 2016, due to completion of all Torrey Reserve Campus development during the second quarter of 2016.   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Same-Store 21 20 Non-Same Store 3 3 Total Properties 24 23 Redevelopment Same-Store 22 22 Total Development Properties 4 5  Outlook  We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities.  We continue our development efforts at Torrey Point (previously Sorrento Pointe) with planned construction to increase rentable office space by approximately 88,000 square feet. Construction of the project is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017, with an expected stabilization date in 2018. Projected costs of the development are approximately $56 million, of which approximately $34 million has been incurred to date. We expect the Torrey Point redevelopment to be stabilized in 2018 with an estimated stabilized yield of approximately 7% to 8%, based on initial estimates.  We intend to opportunistically pursue the development of future phases of Lloyd District Portfolio based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk-adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition.  We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent upon our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.  Table of Contents  Leasing  Our same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. We have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants, as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our spaces. While there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years. We believe the locations of our properties and diverse tenant base mitigate the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment. However, any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we signed 15 retail leases for a total of 42,915 square feet of retail space including 33,114 square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), at an average rental rate increase on a cash basis and GAAP basis of 2.2% and 10.2%, respectively. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 10,381 square feet at an average rental rate decrease on a cash and GAAP basis of 7.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 22,733 square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash and GAAP basis of 8.0% and 17.0%, respectively. Tenant improvements and incentives were $34.83 per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly attributed to tenants at South Bay Marketplace.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we signed 16 office leases for a total of 123,929 square feet of office space including 92,029 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase on a cash and GAAP basis of 4.3% and 6.7%, respectively. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 69,802 square feet at an average rental rate increase on a cash and GAAP basis of 9.5% and 10.6%, respectively. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 22,227 square feet at an average rental rate decrease on a cash and GAAP basis of 8.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Tenant improvements and incentives were $36.49 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly attributed to tenants at City Center Bellevue and Torrey Reserve Campus.  The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base-building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.  The leases signed in 2017 generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2018 and beyond. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time.  Through the remainder of 2017, we believe our leasing volume will be in-line with our historical averages and result in overall positive increases in rental income. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels, if at all.  Table of Contents  Capitalized Costs  Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy. The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction.  We capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of $2.5 million and $11.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of $5.3 million and $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities and other property improvements, which are not significant for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, however, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to development activities of $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Table of Contents  The following table sets forth selected data from our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change % Revenues Rental income $ 70,040 $ 67,245 $ 2,795 4 % Other property income 3,752 3,486 266 8 Total property revenues 73,792 70,731 3,061 4 Expenses Rental expenses 19,859 18,453 1,406 8 Real estate taxes 7,536 6,633 903 14 Total property expenses 27,395 25,086 2,309 9 Total property income 46,397 45,645 752 2 General and administrative (5,082 ) (4,549 ) (533 ) 12 Depreciation and amortization (17,986 ) (17,453 ) (533 ) 3 Interest expense (13,331 ) (12,946 ) (385 ) 3 Other income, net 310 24 286 1,192 Net income 10,308 10,721 (413 ) (4 ) Net income attributable to restricted shares (60 ) (43 ) (17 ) 40 Net income attributable to unitholders in the Operating Partnership (2,861 ) (3,027 ) 166 (5 ) Net income attributable to American Assets Trust, Inc. stockholders $ 7,387 $ 7,651 $ (264 ) (3 )%  Revenue Total property revenues. Total property revenue consists of rental revenue and other property income. Total property revenue increased $3.1 million, or 4%, to $73.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $70.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The percentage leased was as follows for each segment as of March 31, 2017 and 2016: Percentage Leased (1) March 31, 2017 2016 Retail 96.9 % 98.6 % Office 89.3 % 91.3 % Multifamily 93.4 % 79.4 % Mixed-Use (2) 94.1 % 97.8 %  (1) The percentage leased includes the square footage under lease, including leases which may not have commenced as of March 31, 2017 or March 31, 2016, as applicable.

American Assets Trust, Inc. Announces Issuance of $100 Million of 3.78% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series F, Due July 19, 2024
BY GlobeNewswire— 4:15 PM ET 07/19/2017


SAN DIEGO, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Assets Trust, Inc. (AAT) (the “Company”) and American Assets Trust, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) announced today the closing of a privately placed debt offering of $100,000,000 of seven-year senior guaranteed notes (the “Series F Notes”) by the Operating Partnership.  The Series F Notes are unsecured, will pay a fixed interest rate of 3.78% and are due on July 19, 2024.
Prior to closing, the Operating Partnership entered into a treasury lock contract to reduce the interest rate variability exposure of the projected interest cash outflows under the then-prospective private placement of the Series F Notes described above.  As a result, net of the settlement of the treasury lock contract, the fixed interest rate in accordance with GAAP for the Series F Notes is approximately 3.85% per annum, through maturity. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of the Series F Notes to repay outstanding amounts on its credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. About American Assets Trust (AAT), Inc.                                                    American Assets Trust, Inc. (AAT) is a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, headquartered in San Diego, California.  The Company has over 50 years of acquiring, improving, developing and managing premier retail, office and residential properties throughout the United States in some of the nation’s most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. The Company's retail portfolio comprises approximately 3.2 million rentable square feet, and its office portfolio comprises approximately 2.7 million square feet.  In addition, the Company owns one mixed-use property (including approximately 97,000 rentable square feet of retail space and a 369-room all-suite hotel) and over 2,112 multifamily units.  In 2011, the Company was formed to succeed to the real estate business of American Assets, Inc., a privately held corporation founded in 1967 and, as such, has significant experience, long-standing relationships and extensive knowledge of its core markets, submarkets and asset classes.  For additional information, please visit www.americanassetstrust.com.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

 WHEREAS, as a condition to engaging in the Formation Transactions, and as an inducement to do so, the parties hereto are entering into this Agreement;

 DEFINED TERMS 

 For purposes of this Agreement the following terms shall apply: 

 Section 1.1 " 50% Termination"  has the meaning set forth in  Section 1.40 . 

 Section 1.2 " Affiliate"  means, with respect to any Person, any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with such Person. For the purposes of this definition, " control"  when used with respect to any Person means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms " controlling"  and " controlled"  have meanings correlative to the foregoing. 

 Section 1.3 " Agreement"  has the meaning set forth in the preamble.  

 Section 1.4 " Approved Liability"  means either: 

 (a) A liability of the Operating Partnership (or of an entity whose separate existence from the Operating Partnership is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes) with respect to which all of the following requirements are satisfied: 

 (i) the liability is secured by real property or other assets (the " Collateral" ) owned directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership (or by an entity whose separate existence from the Operating Partnership is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes); 

 (ii) on the date on which the Operating Partnership designated such liability as a Approved Liability, the fair market value (as reasonably determined in good faith by the Operating Partnership) of the Collateral was at least 140% times the outstanding principal amount (and any accrued and unpaid interest) of the liability and any other Approved Liabilities secured by such Collateral at such time,  provided  that if interest on such liability is not required to be paid at least annually or if the documents evidencing such liability permit the borrower to borrow additional amounts that are secured by the Collateral, the outstanding principal amount of such liability shall include the maximum amount that could be so added to the principal amount of such liability without a default,  provided, however , if notwithstanding the Operating Partnership' s commercially reasonable efforts, it is unable to make available the Guarantee Opportunities required by this Agreement, 130% shall be substituted for 140% as set forth above; 

 (iii) the liability constitutes " qualified nonrecourse financing"  as defined in Section 465(b)(6) of the Code with respect to the Protected Partners; 

 (iv) other than guaranties by the Guaranty Partners, no other person has executed any guaranties with respect to such liability; and

 For purposes of determining whether clause (ii) has been satisfied in situations where one or more potential Approved Liabilities are secured by more than one item of Collateral, the Operating Partnership shall allocate such liabilities among such items of Collateral in proportion to their relative fair market values (as reasonably determined in good faith by the Operating Partnership); 

 (b) A liability of the Operating Partnership that 

 (i) is not secured by any of the assets of the Operating Partnership and is a general, recourse obligation of the Operating Partnership, and 

 (ii) is not provided by a lender that has an interest in the Operating Partnership or is related to the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 465(b)(3)(C) or the Code;  

 2  

 (c) Solely with respect to the Non-Qualified Liability Amount for each Non-Qualified Liability Partner, the applicable Non-Qualified Liabilities; or

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, "we," "us," "our," and "our company" mean American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this document. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements." Overview  Outlook  We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which we believe allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities.  Our new development at Torrey Point (previously Sorrento Pointe) is close in proximity to Torrey Reserve Campus. Groundbreaking on Torrey Point occurred in July 2015 with development plans including two Class A office buildings of approximately 88,000 square feet in the aggregate, with panoramic unobstructed views of the Torrey Pines State Park Beach, Torrey Reserve and the Pacific Ocean. Projected costs of the development at Torrey Point are approximately $56 million, of which approximately $32 million has been incurred to date. We expect to incur the remaining costs for development of Torrey Point in 2017. We expect the Torrey Point development to be stabilized in 2018 with an estimated stabilized cash yield of approximately 7.0% to 8.0%.  We intend to opportunistically pursue other projects in our development pipeline including future phases of Lloyd District Portfolio, Solana Beach - Highway 101, as well as other redevelopments at Solana Beach Corporate Centre and Lomas Santa Fe Plaza. The commencement of these developments is based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of  whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt.  Same-store  We have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance. While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties to same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (1) reaching 90% occupancy or (2) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Acquired properties are classified to same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion.  In our determination of same-store and redevelopment same-store properties, Lloyd District Portfolio and Torrey Reserve Campus have been identified as redevelopment same-store properties due to the significant construction activity noted above. Office same-store net operating income increased approximately 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Office redevelopment same-store net operating income increased approximately 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  Below is a summary of our same-store composition for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2015, Hassalo on Eighth - Retail was included in non-same-store properties and one development property, Torrey Reserve Land, was removed from development properties, due to the completion of all Torrey Reserve Campus development during the second quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one disposed property was removed from same-store and redevelopment same-store properties and Hassalo on Eighth - Multifamily was included in non-same-store properties when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2014.   December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Same-Store 20 20 21 Non-Same Store 4 3 2 Total Properties 24 23 23 Redevelopment Same-Store 22 22 23 Total Development Properties 4 5 5  Revenue Base  Multifamily Leases. Our multifamily portfolio included four apartment properties, as well as an RV resort, with a total of 1,579 units (including 122 RV spaces) available for lease as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, these properties were 90.3% leased. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the multifamily segment contributed 9.9% of our total revenue. Our multifamily leases, other than at our RV Resort, generally have lease terms ranging from 7 to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms. Tenants normally pay a base rental amount, usually quoted in terms of a monthly rate for the respective unit. Spaces at the RV Resort can be rented at a daily, weekly, or monthly rate. The average monthly base rent per leased unit as of December 31, 2016 was $1,713, compared to $1,605 at December 31, 2015.  Our same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. We have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our spaces. While there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years. We believe the locations of our properties and diverse tenant base mitigate the potentially negative impact of a poor economic environment. However, any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we signed 16 retail leases for a total of 31,064 square feet of retail space including 28,604 square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant), an increase of 4.3% on a cash basis and an increase of 17.5% on a straight-line basis. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 3,246 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 3.8% on a cash basis and 12.4% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 25,358 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 4.4% on a cash basis and an increase of 18.9% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $15.94 per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the three months ended December 31, 2016. There were $19.86 per square foot of retail space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the three months ended December 31, 2016.  During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we signed 16 office leases for a total of 125,836 square feet of office space including 103,401 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of 14.9% on a cash basis and an average rental increase of 31.8% on a straight-line basis. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 46,060 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 15.5% on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of 30.7% on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 57,341 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 14.3% on a cash basis and increase of 32.8% on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were $15.21 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the three months ended December 31, 2016. There were $9.03 per square foot of office space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the three months ended December 31, 2016  The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base building costs (i.e., expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.  The leases signed in 2016 generally become effective over the following year, though some may not become effective until 2018. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, we believe that these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential fluctuations we may achieve in rental income over time.  In 2017, we believe our leasing volume will be in-line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels, if at all.  Critical Accounting Policies  We make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. The collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic conditions, tenant bankruptcies, the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants, the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement. While we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense, actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income. With respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables, we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable, past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its contractual lease obligations, and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant. A change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and corresponding bad debt expense and net income.  Additionally, our assessment of our tenants' abilities to meet their contractual lease obligations includes consideration of the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants and the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants.  Due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. Our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. If our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straight-line revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized, the additional straight-line rental income is . . .

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for American Assets Trust (NYSE:AAT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $49.00 (22.22% upside)

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
