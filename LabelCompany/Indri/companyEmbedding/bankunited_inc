BankUnited, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results






Business Wire




Jul 26, 2017 6:45 AM EDT













 




























































  BankUnited, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:BKU) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $66.4 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $56.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $128.7 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $111.6 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Rajinder Singh, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The second quarter was an excellent one for BankUnited, marked by margin expansion along with strong earnings and solid loan and deposit growth."   Performance Highlights    Net interest income increased by $25.3 million to $239.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 from $214.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Interest income increased by $38.4 million, due primarily to increases in the average balances of loans and investment securities outstanding and to a lesser extent an increase in the yield on interest earning assets. Interest expense increased by $13.1 million, driven by increases in average interest bearing liabilities and the cost of those liabilities. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net interest income increased by $49.0 million to $470.2 million from $421.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.   The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 3.76% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 3.75% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and 3.70% for the immediately preceding quarter ended March 31, 2017. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.73% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 3.79% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.   Total interest earning assets increased by $1.1 billion during the second quarter of 2017. Non-covered loans and leases, including equipment under operating lease, grew by $836 million during the quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, total interest earning assets increased by $1.2 billion.   Total deposits increased by $853 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 to $20.8 billion. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, total deposits increased by $1.3 billion.   Book value per common share grew to $24.16 at June 30, 2017, an 8.0% increase from June 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share increased by 8.4% over the same period, to $23.44 at June 30, 2017.     Capital   The Company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory guidelines required to be considered well capitalized. The Company's and BankUnited, N.A.'s regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows:           BankUnited, Inc.       BankUnited, N.A.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
