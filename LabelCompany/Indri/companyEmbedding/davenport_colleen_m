Colleen was smart, thoughtful and very detailed in every project worked on.  Her approach illustrated a great understanding of the realities of business and balancing that with realities of the law.  Her listening, communication and creative approach to problems helped Insignia through a very challenging time in our development.  As a colleague, you could trust her in all aspects of being a great team player, despite the ever-growing list of responsibilities and challenges.  I would highly recommend her as an asset to any organization.See moreSee lessColleen was invaluable to Insignia during a turbulent time of a corporate turnaround. During her time here we were able to dramatically lower our legal costs and efforts, as well as bring diligence and organization to contracts and other legal matters. Colleen was hard-working, motivated and an ardent supporter of the company vision. She also contributed to HR and general business issues. I enjoyed working with her, and truly feel her efforts contributed to the success of the company.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended ColleenGroupse-LEGALGustavus Adolphus College AlumniMitchell Hamline Group:  Women in LawHamline University School of LawACC Mid-America ChapterUSA Esquire JobsThe Lawyer WhispererSee 3 moreACC Minnesota - Minnesota Chapter of the Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC)Corporate CounselINHOUSE LEGAL - General Counsels, CLO's, In House Lawyers, General CounselSee lessView Colleen’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Colleen directlyView Colleen’s Full ProfileNot the Colleen you’re looking for?

Colleen M Willman's Experience
Title: Supportive Service Specialist
               Company: Safer Foundation
Job Details
               * Safer provides employment services geared to making successful job placements. To Safer that means a client remains employed for at least thirty days. After thirty days, a Safer "lifeguard" remains in contact with the client for a year to support the critical transitions to work and other areas of his or her life. To date, Safer has placed over 40, 000 ex-offenders in jobs. * Safer offers several education programs in different locations. The Youth Empowerment Program (YEP) is a peer learning model that is open to 16-21 years olds and is designed to prepare students to continue their education after Safer. The Crossroads Community Correctional Center offers a similar peer learning model for its residents. The PACE Institute provides pretrial detainees and sentenced inmates in Chicago's Cook County Jail with basic education and life skills. * Of the 320 students who participated in the Youth Empowerment Program in the last four years, 81% completed the training. Their academic progress increased 12.52 % from pre to post GED readiness. Of these students, 96 % registered for the GED and 56 students obtained it. * Just under 200 (76%) of the students who completed YEP training were placed either in vocational training or jobs, with 95% achieving at least 30-days retention in their placements. An additional 6% went on to pursue higher education goals. * Safer's three year recidivism rate for the Youth Empowerment Program is 21.4%, which is less than one-half the Illinois juvenile rate of 51 % for the same period.
