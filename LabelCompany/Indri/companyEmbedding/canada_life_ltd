Life insurance
Life insurance can help protect the people who rely on you, and assure them that they will be taken care of if you are no longer there. 












Life insurance can be used to provide financial security and income for those you name as beneficiary, pay any debts and final expenses, or leave a legacy for future generations or charitable organizations that you care about.

In addition to the protection life insurance offers after your death, it can also support a sound financial plan while you’re alive. Permanent life insurance gives you the opportunity to grow cash value within your policy over time, which can help you achieve your financial goals – like supplementing your retirement income or paying for your children’s education. We offer two types of permanent coverage: universal life insurance and participating life insurance.

Term life insurance is well-suited to shorter-term protection needs at a lower initial cost.











Term life insurance
Well-suited to meet high, short-term protection needs for the lowest initial cost.

Learn more










Participating life insurance
Lifelong protection with the potential to build tax-advantaged cash value.

Learn more










Universal life insurance
Flexible, cost-effective lifetime coverage combined with an investment component.

Canada Life Ireland




















A change of name from Canada Life to Irish Life


As you may be aware Great-West Lifeco, the parent company of Canada Life Ireland, recently bought the Irish Life Group. 
We have now combined Canada Life Ireland and Irish Life into one business under the Irish Life brand. This means that Canada Life 
policies will become Irish Life policies from 1 January 2014.
 
What does this mean for you?
The main difference is that instead of Canada Life, our communications will now carry the Irish Life brand. So for example our website 
and any letters we send you will carry the Irish Life name. You can find the information and material that was on the Canada Life 
website on the Irish Life website here.

We want to thank you for being a valued customer of Canada Life and look forward to continuing to serve you as a customer of the new Irish Life.








Canada Life Customers



Canada Life Website
					The Canada Life website is now closed all Canada Life related material and contact details can now be found on the Irish Life website.

Group Pension Scheme Member Access

					Group Pension Scheme Member's can continue to access their information using the Group Pension Member Scheme Access application.
