Memorial Trees by Honoring a Life




    When you choose to have a memorial tree planted for your loved one, you are doing more than simply putting a plant in the ground.
    You are making a long-term commitment to the environment and implanting the memories of your loved one in our planet for countless
    years to come. A memorial tree is a unique tribute which provides global benefits like no other memorial gift could.




        What is a memorial tree?
    



What you receive:

A memorial tree planted in the area of greatest need, according to the planting schedule of the American Forests Organization. 
A memorial card to be sent to your home, or a person of your choosing which demonstrates the gift you have given.
Your name and message listed in this online memorial, and on the honoringalife.org website.



                    In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for 
family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.

SHERMAN OAKS, Calif., Nov. 1, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Sandra E. Bell has joined Prospect Mortgage, LLC ("Prospect" or the "Company") as Chief Financial Officer.  Ms. Bell will oversee all financial activities of the Company.  
(Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090617/LA34214LOGO-b)
"The breadth and depth of Sandra's experience will be a tremendous asset for us as we continue to grow and diversify the Company's operations," said Ron Bergum, Prospect's Chief Executive Officer.  "She is a valuable addition to an already deep and experienced executive management team.  We are building a world-class organization and Sandra's participation further enhances our ability to execute our strategic vision."   
Ms. Bell brings almost 30 years of business experience in the financial services and energy industries, both as a public company Chief Financial Officer and investment banker.  Most recently, Ms. Bell has been providing strategic financial advisory services to senior executives and private equity investors in evaluating M&A opportunities, defining strategic decision frameworks, assessing capital execution strategies and supporting IPO preparation activities, including strategic consulting work performed for Prospect this year.   
Ms. Bell previously served as Chief Financial Officer of PHH Corporation, a publicly traded, multi-divisional financial services company engaged in the private label mortgage services and fleet management businesses.  While at PHH, her responsibilities included treasury, cash management and banking relationships, strategic planning, budgeting and forecasting, investor relations, accounting and public reporting, audit and tax. 
Prior to PHH, Ms. Bell was the Chief Financial Officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati from 2004 through 2006.  Her additional leadership positions include roles as Chief Financial Officer of two publicly registered companies, and more than 21 years on Wall Street financing energy companies, including a 13-year career at Deutsche Bank Securities. 
"We are very pleased and fortunate to add Sandra to our dedicated team," said Bergum. "She brings the expertise necessary to help position the Company for the future." 
Prospect Mortgage is a top ten national home purchase lender offering a full range of quality home loans, including FHA and VA, conventional, jumbo and super jumbo, renovation, and more. It is backed by Sterling Partners, a private equity firm with approximately $5 billion of assets under management and offices in Chicago, Baltimore, and Miami.
