  Repeatable Workflow for Self-Service Data Analytics

 








For many analysts in business groups such as marketing, sales, finance, or customer insight, the process to prep, blend and analyze data is slow and painful. It requires different tools and people to gather, cleanse and join data from different sources, more tools to build and publish analytic models, and even more to get it into the hands of business decision makers.
Alteryx Designer solves this by delivering a repeatable workflow for self-service data analytics that leads to deeper insights in hours, not the weeks typical of traditional approaches! Alteryx Designer empowers data analysts by combining data preparation, data blending, and analytics – predictive, statistical and spatial – using the same intuitive user interface.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Sector Rank assigns a rating to each of the 16 Sectors based on their average Zacks Rank.
A sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The sector with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top sector (1 out of 16), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Sectors. The sector with the worst average Zacks Rank (16 out of 16) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Company SummaryCompany NameAlteryx, Inc.Founded2010Big Data Landscape CategoryAnalytics and VisualizationLocationHQIrvine, CAWebsiteAlteryx, Inc.PeopleCEODean StoeckerEmployees51-200FinancialFunding$18-$19 Million



 Alteryx, Inc.
Founded in 2010, Alteryx, Inc. is a business analytics and visualization company based out of Irvine, CA that creates analytic applications for collecting and combining structured and unstructured data from disparate sources; performing, spatial, predictive, and statistical analytics; and giving users a platform for sharing analytic applications throughout a network.
Alteryx Inc. as it exists today first grew out of an LLC of the same name, Alteryx LLC, which produced the original products in the Alteryx Inc. line. Since then, Alteryx Inc. has expanded the package data and consumer spatial analytics products it inherited and developed them into a more expansive platform to be scaled and applied in a wide variety of industries. Alteryx Inc. continues to focus on statistical analytics, predictive or R-based analytics, and SaaS connectivity, all achieved in the cloud.
The Alteryx platform functions by transmitting customer data into a data engine, which is managed behind the firewall by a data analyst. Using MongoDB and NoQsl, data is migrated to apps held in the cloud, which are in turn accessed by customers, who have the option to integrate outside market information alongside private data.
Since the formation of Alteryx, Inc., the company has expanded into multiple markets such as communications, marketing, retail, data management, finance, healthcare, and hospitality. Alteryx Inc. is privately held and has raised $18 million in funding since its formation, a significant portion of which came as recently as 2013 when the company raised $12 million dollars in venture capital from SAP Ventures and TOBA Capital (a firm formed by Vinny Smith, founder and former CEO of Quest).
Alteryx also partners with Tableau Software to supplement the company’s data analytics engine with a more robust visualization platform than is carried in native Alteryx software.
Alteryx, Inc. was founded by Dean Stoecker, Ned Harding, and Olivia Duane Adams, all of whom remain with the company as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Customer Officer, respectively. Alteryx Inc. keeps its headquarters in Irvine, but also keeps offices in Silicon Valley, CA and Boulder, CO. Alteryx Inc. claims to serve over 300 organizations and 200,000 users.

Whenever Alteryx recognizes a field as a Date, it should default to Date, not Date/Time. I don't think I'm in the minority, but I rarely need to see the date AND the time. 99.9% of all of my date fields do not have a time associate with them; such as: Open Date, Close Date, Remodel Date, Lease Expiration Date, Lease Start Date, Date Record Updated, Relocation Date, etc., etc., etc. So I always get results like 4/1/2013 12:00:00, which makes it difficult to query against without changing to just Date. I would venture to guess that most people don't use the time either, but I may be wrong. So, defaulting to just Date would save a lot of us that extra step for each date column.

Hi All,when we create formulae or filters in Alteryx, it would be great not just tohave the option to include fields (by their names) in the formulae butalso have the option to include specific values from the fields right from a drop-down menu. E.g. if I have a field called ‘Region’ with 5 values like (Africa and Middle East;Europe; etc.), filtering the database for these individual values of ‘Region’would be simpler if I could just select the values themselves from a drop-downlist. I have now the ‘variables’ small tab in the formula configuration window butevery time I have to type the value after selecting ‘Region’== from the variables.This is annoying with long field values - you have to be careful with pronunciation.If a simple right click or a new tab in the configuration window would list me the valuesof the field (e.g. only if a categorical variable - it can list the top 10 most frequent values),it is simpler to write the formula.Thank you,Laszlo

When working with complex modules, it would be great to allow an option to add a tool upstream and automatically rewire to downstreams tools.Simplified example:Text Input flows to (1) Filter and (2) Formulae Tool. If I want to drag and drop a Formulae Icon after the text input to be applied to both paths, I can't. I have to either choose To apply to Path (1) or to Path (2). I know that you can right click, press insert after, and search for the tool, but this is not a time efficient manner.  You can also delete the wiring and rewire yourself, but if you have mutliple downstream tools, this is a pain.

Our Alteryx users query a number of different data sources.  Some of these include external servers outside our control.To avoid any issues regarding locking, we use the Read Uncommitted function as part of the Data Input tool as part of our baseline design, probably 95% of the time or more.It would be very beneficial for our organization if there was a way for us to set this option to be checked by default, so that it was one less thing users needed to remember when configuring a quick data pull.

						I love the new Basic Filter option and it makes writing filters easy/self-expanatory for new users and helps with functions like isnull(). However, I'm almost always writing what are now called 'Custom Filters' and it takes two clicks to do this.From a User Experience perspective it would be great if you could click in the expression box to write the filter rather than having to check the customer filter check box, or start by creating a basic filter and then make it more complex using the custom filter box without having to check the tick box.Following on from this and something that is probably a lot harder to implement - But with the new basic filter, it would be great to have a list of available fields populate the options to filter by - Similar to the option that you get in Calgary. E.g Country == and then the drop down list would contain whatever is available in the data (e.g. Spain, UK, USA, Etc...)

User Story:  As a data analyst, I want to be able to easily edit my data's meta-data, so that down-stream actions can easily consume and export my data.  Currently, you can do a bulk edit of your data's metadata, however, this has to be done using the Multi-Field formula. However, this solution is non-intuitive, and seems to run counter to the solution design of Alteryx, where each and every step is it's own module.  A single module handling bulk and single column/attribute metadata transformations and editing would be (a) much more intuitive and (b) save analysts time of hand editing meta-data.  cheers!

						It would be handy to have an increment function similar to SQL's Identity datatype that allows you to specify a seed and increment value.  It would seem like a really simple tool to add.  Ideally the seed value could come from an incoming connection to give the flexibility of retrieving the seed value from a database.I've found a workaround explained on my blog here, but it would just be handy to have this built in.

It would be really useful to have a Join function that updated an existing file (not a database, but a flat or yxdb file). The rough SAS equivalent are the UPDATE and MODIFY Statementshttp://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/basess/58133/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001329151.htm The goal would be to have a join function that would allow you to update a master dataset's missing variables from a transaction database and, optionally, to overwrite values on the master data set with current ones, without duplicating records, based on a common key. The use case is you have an original file, new information comes in and you want to fill in the data that was originally missing without overwriting the original data (if there is data on the transaction file for that variable). In this case only missing data is changed. Or as a separate use case, you had original data which has now been updated and you do want to overwrite the original data. In this case any variable with new values is updated, and variables without new values is left unchanged. Why this is needed: if you don't have a Oracle type database, it is difficult to do this task inside of Alteryx and information changes over time (customers buy new products, customers update profiles, you have a file that is missing some data, and want to merge with a file that has better data for missing values, but worse data for exisitng values (it is from a different time period (e.g. older)).  In theory you could do this with "IF isnull() Then replace" statements, but you'd have to build them for each variable and have a long data flow to capture the correct updates. Now is is much faster to do it in SAS and import the updated file back into Alteryx.

						A client has requested that we provide the ability to have the two digit year begin a date string.  Currently, we have the following:yyyy-MM-ddyyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ssyyyy*MM*ddyyyyMMddIn addition, they have requested that we have the ability to convert from a date field to another date field.  Currently, we can only convert to/from a string to date and vice versa, but not date to date (which would be helpful in a date format).

In the summary tool, we often use the summary tool to concatenate strings - we love this functionality. However, we would also like to be able to concatenate just the unique values of strings. This could be done if we ran the preceding text field through the unique tool first, and then concatenate. But when we are doing this for multiple text variables and when we need to summarize other types of data at the same time, this becomes a very un-natural combination of joins & macros.  Thanks for considering,Jeremy

It would be a nice time-saver to allow for multiple fields to be selected and / or deselected at the same time in the Transpose tool...the Select tool and Summarize tool already allow for this.Very wide survey files in particular would benefit from this kind of feature.

If progress bar or overall process completion percentage can be displayed somewhere, adds great value for the users running complex processes (with multiple databases/ files as input and complex queries especially spatial queries).

Idea:In forecasting and in commercial/sme risk scoring there is a need for trying vast number of algebraic equations which is a very cumbersome prosess. Let's add symbolic regression as a new competitive capability. Rationale:Summations, ratios, power transforms and all combinations of a like are needed to be tested as new variables for a forecasting or prediction model. Doing this by hand manually is a though and long business... And there is always a possibility for one to skip a valuable combination.  Symbolic regression is a novel techinique for automatically generating algebraic equations with use of genetic programming, In every evolution a variable is selected checked if the equation is discriminatitive of the target variable at hand. In every next step frequently observed variables will be selected more likely.  Benefit for clients:This method produces variables mainly with nonlinear relationships. It is a technique that will help in corporate/commercial/sme risk modelling, such that powerful risk models are generated from a hort list of B/S and P/L based algebraic equations.There is potential use cases in algorithmic trading as well... There are 3 very interesting world problems solved with symbolic regression here.A very relevant thesis by sean Wouter is attached as a pdf document for your reading pleasure... R side of things:I've found Rgp package for genetic programming, here is a link. Competition:I haven't seen something similar in SAS, SPSS but there is this; http://www.nutonian.com/products/eureqa/Also there is Bruce Ratner's page

Idea: Some well known scoring methods use optimal binned variables for added robustness. Let's add this capability to Alteryx. Retionale:Here's a basic link on why to do that; http://documents.software.dell.com/statistics/textbook/optimal-binning Current status in Alterys as I'm aware of:Tile tool or Multi-field Binning tool for completing same task as Tile tool on multiple fields, splits the variables by 5 methods;Equal Records or Intervals or SumsSmart TileUnique Value ManualUnfortunately "equal something" binnings are bad idea, as the values are categorized "blindly" irrespective of the effects on the predictive power of the models.  What to do:What's needed is to bin both numerical and categorical variables optimally such that the Weights of Evidences (WoE) should present a monotone increasing or decreasing pattern. Maybe at most a V or U shaped "convex" structure. Quick win:Without constraining ourselves with monotonicity or convex cases, the easiest practice would be running a C4.5 or CHAID tree algorithm (produces multiple splits rather than binary splits in CART) for a single variable and select the target as the dependent variable and all the resulting nodes will be the bins we are looking for. Doing this for multiple variables at once is the key to the tool to be generated. Clients:This capability is sought by risk management departments building robust, stable Basel compliant models in financial industry, especially by banks.

						I think a great functionality addon would be a tool that could allow one to impute dates.  While the formula tool and multi-row tool can in many cases assist, it is not useful when dealing with batch macros where a date imputation would need to change.

When using ./*.csv for an input (relative path and wildcard), a preview does not show in the Properties area of the input tool.  Can this be added?

						It would be great to just have a little tool like a comment box that could be based on whatever you want... like if you always want to see the max date at a certain point, or the grand total. It would be similar to how you can put formulas in the titles in Tableau like "Current as of <MAX(Date)>" or something like that. The best way (I think) would be to have it like the Annotations, but make it so you can turn it on or off at any stage in the workflow (right now annotations are only show or hide all) and make it dynamic based on results from the workflow up to that point. Right now I'm accomplishing this just by using a summary and browse tool, and then I put the result in the title of the toolbox manually.

History[edit]
SRC LLC, the predecessor to Alteryx, was founded in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding.[3][1] SRC developed the first online data engine for delivering demographic-based mapping and reporting shortly after being founded.[11] In 1998, SRC released Allocate, a data engine incorporating geographically organized U.S. Census data[12] that allows users to manipulate, analyze and map data.[13] Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.[11]
In 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the U.S. Census Bureau that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on CD-ROMs of Census Data sold by the Bureau.[13][14]
In 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.[11]
In 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.[1]
In 2011, Alteryx raised $6 million in venture funding from the Palo Alto investment arm of SAP AG, SAP Ventures.[3] In 2013, Alteryx raised $12 million from SAP Ventures and Toba Capital.[15][16] In 2014, the company raised $60 million in Round B funding[7][8] from Insight Venture Partners, SAP Ventures and Toba Capital, and announced plans for a 30% workforce expansion.[6]
In 2015, Iconiq Capital led a $85 million investment in Alteryx, with Insight Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners also participating. Alteryx announced plans to use the new capital to expand internationally, invest in research and development, and increase its sales and marketing efforts.[17][18]
Alteryx announced in 2015 a new relationship with Microsoft in order to enable faster and easier data analysis through Power BI.[19]
In 2016, Alteryx was ranked #24 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[20]
On March 24, 2017, Alteryx went public launching their IPO at the NYSE.[21]
Products[edit]
Alteryx currently offers three main products: Alteryx Designer, Alteryx Server and Alteryx Connect. Alteryx also hosts a cloud-based website known as the Alteryx Analytics Gallery.[22][23][24]

SRC LLC, the predecessor to Alteryx, was founded in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding.[3][1] SRC developed the first online data engine for delivering demographic-based mapping and reporting shortly after being founded.[11] In 1998, SRC released Allocate, a data engine incorporating geographically organized U.S. Census data[12] that allows users to manipulate, analyze and map data.[13] Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.[11]
In 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the U.S. Census Bureau that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on CD-ROMs of Census Data sold by the Bureau.[13][14]
In 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.[11]
In 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.[1]
In 2011, Alteryx raised $6 million in venture funding from the Palo Alto investment arm of SAP AG, SAP Ventures.[3] In 2013, Alteryx raised $12 million from SAP Ventures and Toba Capital.[15][16] In 2014, the company raised $60 million in Round B funding[7][8] from Insight Venture Partners, SAP Ventures and Toba Capital, and announced plans for a 30% workforce expansion.[6]
In 2015, Iconiq Capital led a $85 million investment in Alteryx, with Insight Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners also participating. Alteryx announced plans to use the new capital to expand internationally, invest in research and development, and increase its sales and marketing efforts.[17][18]
Alteryx announced in 2015 a new relationship with Microsoft in order to enable faster and easier data analysis through Power BI.[19]
In 2016, Alteryx was ranked #24 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[20]
On March 24, 2017, Alteryx went public launching their IPO at the NYSE.[21]
Products[edit]
Alteryx currently offers three main products: Alteryx Designer, Alteryx Server and Alteryx Connect. Alteryx also hosts a cloud-based website known as the Alteryx Analytics Gallery.[22][23][24]
