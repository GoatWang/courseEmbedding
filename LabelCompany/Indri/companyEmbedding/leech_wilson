Tires are rotated to achieve a uniform wear for all tires. Each tire performs different tasks (such as steering in front- versus rear-wheel drive), therefore tires wear at different rates. Tires should be rotated every 7,500 miles to prevent irregular tire wear.Tire RepairWhether you are in the market for tire repair or replacement, our Chevy Certified Service technicians can handle all of your tire needs.

Northern Trust Names Wilson Leech as New CEO for EMEA




Biff Bowman named as head of Americas for Corporate & Institutional 
      Services






November 15, 2010 04:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Northern Trust (Nasdaq: NTRS) announced today that it has appointed Wilson 
      Leech as CEO for its Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, 
      based in London. Leech, who was previously head of Northern Trust’s 
      Global Fund Services group, succeeds Biff Bowman who will assume 
      the position of head of Americas for the Corporate & Institutional 
      Services upon the retirement of 33-year Northern Trust veteran, Lee 
      Selander at the end of November
    


      In his new role, Leech is responsible for overseeing all of Northern 
      Trust’s businesses in EMEA which provide asset servicing and asset 
      management solutions and services to institutional and ultra-high net 
      worth clients across the region.
    

      “We are delighted to appoint Wilson to lead our business in EMEA,” said 
      Steven Fradkin, President of Corporate & Institutional Services at 
      Northern Trust. “The EMEA region is an area of strategic growth and 
      continuing expansion for Northern Trust and Wilson’s experience, local 
      expertise and strong leadership will be instrumental as we build on the 
      contributions that Biff has made during his tenure as CEO.”
    

      Leech joined Northern Trust in 2004, to head the company’s Global Fund 
      Services business, which focuses on delivering fund administration and 
      servicing solutions to fund managers across the globe. He holds a 
      Finance and Business degree from University of Greenwich Business 
      School, where he now serves as Chairman on the Advisory Board, and is 
      also a Chartered Management Accountant.
    

      Bowman, who was appointed CEO in 2008, will now return to Chicago. He 
      has worked at Northern Trust for 25 years, holding various positions 
      across the globe.
    

      “We commend Biff for his work in leading our EMEA business,” said 
      Fradkin. “He took the helm at a time of increased global economic 
      instability and uncertainty, and through the work Biff conducted with 
      the leadership team in EMEA, Northern Trust has emerged strong and well 
      positioned in the EMEA marketplace.”
    

      Northern Trust currently employs over 2500 people across its offices in 
      the EMEA region – in Abu Dhabi, Amsterdam, Dublin, Guernsey, Jersey, 
      Limerick, London, Luxembourg and, most recently opened in September 
      2009, an office in Stockholm.

Gretchen Leech and Christopher Wilson's Wedding Website







MenuGretchen and Christopher   April 22, 2017    • Denver, CO94 days agoOur StoryHow we metWe both attended the Heather Ridge Ward while living in Denver, Colorado. Chris was assigned to be Gretchen's home teacher, and we officially met in December 2014. About a year later, Chris was called to the Young Men's presidency, and Gretchen was serving in the Young Women's presidency in the ward. After getting to know each other a little better (and with a lot of encouragement from our friends), we had our first date on April 22, 2016. It was a double date set up by our friends Jimmy and Vanessa Chapman. We went country dancing at the Stampede in Aurora, Colorado. Although neither of us are dancers, we had a good time and agreed that we should go out again!We got engaged!We got engaged on August 20, 2016. Chris told Gretchen that he was busy with errands all day. Then that evening, he came over and suggested we go for a walk at Utah Park. We walked around the park and came to a stop on a little bridge. Chris said he had to tie his shoe. Gretchen just stood there, oblivious. The next thing Gretchen knew, Chris was pulling a black box out of his pocket and asking her to marry him! Gretchen maintains that she had no idea what was happening and was genuinely surprised!The WeddingSaturday, April 22, 201711:00 AMCeremonyDenver Colorado Temple - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints2001 E Phillips Cir, Centennial, CO 80122, USAOther EventsDenver Ring Ceremony & ReceptionSaturday, April 22, 20176:00 PMChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints740 Hudson Street, Denver, CO, United StatesUtah Open HouseSaturday, April 29, 20176:00 PMThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints9894 South 2700 West, South Jordan, UT, United StatesThanks, we've received your .Schedule Your Reminder.Sign up below and we'll remind you a month before the wedding to check back for all the details you need to know.Please enter a valid email address.Remind MeWebsite created on The Knot.
