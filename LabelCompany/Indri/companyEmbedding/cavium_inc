Cavium, Inc. Key Developments

Cavium, Inc. Announces 25/50Gbps Ethernet Adapter Technology Powers Hewlett Packard Enterprise Synergy
Jul 18 17
Cavium, Inc. announced that its FastLinQ Ethernet 25/50GbE technology will power HPE Synergy 480 and 660 Gen10 compute modules. The introduction for this new class of I/O connectivity for the HPE Synergy Gen 9 and Gen 10 compute modules provides significant density, cost and power benefits and enables acceleration of enterprise, telco and cloud applications. Cavium FastLinQ NICs are built from the ground up to bridge traditional and new IT with the agility, speed and continuous delivery needed for today's applications. Based on the innovative technology from Cavium and HPE, customers can run more demanding workloads and applications that require higher bandwidth and lower latency than existing I/O offerings. This includes hybrid cloud, Big Data, high performance compute and traditional enterprise applications. The HPE Synergy 6810C 25/50Gb Ethernet adapter, powered by Cavium's QL45604 controller, delivers high bandwidth and low latency connectivity for the HPE Synergy platform. This dual-port 25/50Gb adapter provides 2.5 times the available server I/O bandwidth for HPE Synergy Gen 9 and Gen 10 compute modules vs. previous generation, allowing HPE customers to improve workload performance. With support for RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), I/O latency is significantly reduced to increase application performance. Key Ethernet technologies and features include HPE Synergy 6810C 25/50Gb Ethernet adapter supports up to 100Gbps bi-directional bandwidth for enhanced network performance. Designed to support HPC clusters, computational, financial and other applications requiring low-latency network connectivity with support for RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE). Also capable of supporting Internet Wide Area RDMA Protocol (iWARP) with future firmware upgrade. DPDK support provides small packet acceleration capability for telco, ecommerce and other applications. Advanced Server Virtualization features that include Single Root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) for low latency high-performance virtual workloads. Support for PXE boot, IPV6 and HPE Sea of Sensor 3D Technology to simplify connectivity and improve overall TCO of the network connectivity. Acceleration for Networking Virtualization with Stateless Offloads for tunneling protocols including NVGRE, VxLAN and GRE. Security features: authenticated updates for NICs validate that signed firmware is correct and trusted to eliminate rogue firmware installation. Secure Boot safeguards the NIC and ensures no rogue drivers are being executed on start-up. Sanitization (Secure User Data Erase) renders user and configuration data on the NIC irretrievable so that NICs can be safely repurposed or disposed. The new HPE Synergy 6810C 25/50Gb Ethernet adapter was recently announced by HPE on July 11, 2017 and will be shipping in the third quarter of 2017.

Demonstrating success in working closely with software developers and communities since the initial launch of ThunderX, Cavium has established a significant ecosystem that spans Operating Systems, Development Environments, Tools, and Applications. An increasing array of hosted options such as Packet.Net and the online Scaleway cloud service offerings, combined with a rich set of single and dual-socket ODM and OEM platforms that include and OCP configurations, allow developers to easily build, develop, and deploy their software on ThunderX based platforms. The ThunderX2 product family is Cavium's second-generation 64-bit ARMv8-A server processor SoCs for datacenter, cloud and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The family integrates fully out-of-order, high-performance custom cores supporting single- and dual-socket configurations. ThunderX2 is optimized to drive high computational performance delivering outstanding memory bandwidth and memory capacity. The new line of ThunderX2 processors includes multiple workload optimized SKUs for both scale up and scale out applications and is fully compliant with ARMv8-A architecture specifications as well as the ARM Server Base System Architecture and ARM Server Base Boot Requirements standards. With increasing HPC end user deployments, Cavium has directly delivered key open source software contributions that are particularly targeted for compute-specific applications, such as optimizations for GCC, LLVM, and OpenBLAS.  Cavium continues to actively contribute to the upstream kernel.org enablement for ThunderX2 that supports close collaboration with leading Linux OS partners: Canonical, Red Hat, and SUSE.  OpenHPC is a growing community for software and best practices that Cavium has actively supported with reference systems for ARM based build, test, and validation activities. Building on the open source software that OpenHPC is delivering, many of Cavium's commercial partners are expanding their commercial support for ThunderX and ThunderX2.

Comparison of ARMv8-A cores

ThunderX2 SoCs[edit]
Cavium announced in 2016 the ThunderX2 line of SoCs, an iterative improvement of their ThunderX line.[10][11] ThunderX2 has up to 54 custom ARM cores and is manufactured on Global Foundries' 14nm FinFET process. These and other improvements are reported to offer twice the performance per core of the ThunderX line.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
