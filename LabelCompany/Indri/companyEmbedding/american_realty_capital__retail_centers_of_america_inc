NEW YORK, Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- American Finance Trust, Inc. ("AFIN") announced today that the special committee of the board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of American Realty Capital – Retail Centers of America, Inc. ("RCA") for approximately $1.4 billion, payable in a combination of AFIN common shares and cash plus the assumption of certain debt. This transaction creates a premier diversified REIT with a retail focus, with an enterprise value of approximately $3.9 billion1. The transaction enhances AFIN's scale by combining two highly complementary U.S. real estate portfolios comprised of 494 properties aggregating 20.8 million rentable square feet, while improving the Company's capital structure and creating accretion to AFIN's funds from operations per share in 2017. 


The special committee of AFIN's board of directors, which consists of the independent members of the board of directors, was formed to evaluate the proposed transaction and has approved the transaction, subject to the approval of AFIN's shareholders and the shareholders of RCA. 
Michael Weil, Chief Executive Officer of AFIN, commented, "We are pleased to announce today's transaction which will bring together two high quality real estate portfolios and will create a best-in-class diversified REIT with a retail focus. The combination of AFIN and RCA will help the Company achieve critical scale, afford improved access to capital markets, result in significant cost savings for shareholders, and increase coverage of our distributions. For AFIN, today's announcement is a key step forward in our plan to grow earnings."
David M. Gong, Lead Independent Director of AFIN, explained, "The board of directors of AFIN formed the special committee, which consists of the independent members of the board, to evaluate potential strategic transactions.  It further empowered the special committee to negotiate terms of any transaction which the committee determined to pursue.  The special committee believes that the combination of the two companies will significantly enhance shareholder value."
Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Merger
Enhances Size, Improves Access to Capital Markets, and Increases Liquidity Options: The combined company will become a premier diversified REIT with a retail focus, with an enterprise value of approximately $3.9 billion1. Increased scale will enhance access to capital markets and increase liquidity options.
Improves Capital Structure: AFIN will have lower leverage with manageable near-term debt maturities and ample near-term liquidity. The improved capital structure also provides AFIN with a strong balance sheet for continued growth and acquisitions.
Creates Accretive Transaction: The transaction is expected to be accretive to AFIN's funds from operations per share in 2017 and strengthens the Company's distribution coverage.
Broadens Tenant Diversification: The addition of RCA's retail portfolio will broaden AFIN's retail tenant base and reduce AFIN's top 10 tenant concentration to 48% from 75% on an annualized straight-line rent basis as of June 30, 2016.
Significantly Reduces Fees and Creates Meaningful Synergies: Expected $10.9 million of annual savings in 2017 from $6.1 million in contractual asset management fee savings and $4.8 million in general and administrative expense savings.  Decreased management fees on future equity raised.
Creates Internalization Option: Creates a defined management internalization option under the AFIN advisory agreement benefiting shareholders at both companies. 
Terms of the Transaction and Timing
Under the terms of the agreement, RCA shareholders will receive 0.385 shares of AFIN common stock and $0.95 in cash for each share of RCA common stock they own. Upon closing, RCA shareholders will own approximately 37% of the combined company. The approximately 90% stock component of the transaction is expected to be tax-free to shareholders.
The merger agreement also provides RCA with a go-shop period during which time RCA will have the right to actively solicit alternative proposals from third parties for 45 days. The merger agreement provides for RCA to pay a termination fee of $5.1 million to AFIN if RCA terminates the merger agreement in connection with a superior proposal that arises on or before the date that is fifteen days following the end of the go-shop period. 
AFIN will add two independent directors to be appointed by RCA's board of directors, bringing to six the total number of directors for the combined company, five of them independent.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of AFIN and RCA shareholders as well as satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

 Shareholder Action Regarding American Realty Capital - Retail Centers of America, Inc. Filed by 
         










    










 













 











 



















Shareholder Action Regarding American Realty Capital - Retail Centers of America, Inc. Filed by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP
        																																
              











 News provided by
Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP  
May 27, 2016, 11:14 ET









 Share this article




























































RADNOR, Pa., May 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that it has filed a shareholder action regarding American Realty Capital – Retail Centers of America, Inc. ("ARC-RCA" or the "Company") against the Company's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  








ARC-RCA shareholders who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne O. Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299 – 7706 or at info@ktmc.com.  To view a copy of the complaint, or for additional information about the shareholder action, please visit https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/american-realty-capital#join.
ARC-RCA is a non-traded real estate investment trust ("REIT").  According to public filings, the Company acquires and owns "anchored, stabilized core retail properties for investment purposes, including power centers and lifestyle centers."  ARC-RCA is controlled by AR Global Investments, LLC ("AR Global"), a related entity currently taking steps to "roll up" many of its non-traded REITs, including the following:

American Realty Capital – Retail Centers of America, Inc.; 
American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III, Inc.; 
American Realty Capital Global Trust II, Inc.; and 
Realty Finance Trust, Inc.
On April 29, 2016, ARC-RCA filed a Proxy Statement with the SEC setting the Company's Annual Meeting for June 29, 2016.  Therein, the defendants recommended that ARC-RCA's shareholders vote at the Annual Meeting to approve numerous amendments to the Company's Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the "Charter").  As more fully detailed in the complaint, approval of the proposed amendments to the Charter will eliminate valuable shareholder protections and rights currently enjoyed by ARC-RCA's shareholders under the Charter, including the right to an independent appraisal of the Company's value in connection with a roll up transaction and the ability to receive a pro rata share of the Company's appraised value in cash, as well as protections concerning the Company's ability to engage in "conflicted transactions" with related parties.
As further detailed in the complaint, although the defendants seek to eliminate valuable protections currently enjoyed by ARC-RCA shareholders under the Company's Charter, the Proxy Statement's explanation for why shareholder approval is sought for amendments to the Charter is materially misleading and incomplete.  For example, the Proxy Statement fails to disclose that AR Global has already taken steps to roll up ARC-RCA and other non-traded REITs controlled by AR Global into American Finance Trust, Inc. – another non-traded REIT controlled by AR Global.  The Proxy Statement is also materially misleading and incomplete with respect to disclosures concerning proposed amendments to the Charter that would eliminate conflicts of interest protections and restrictions on the Company's advisor, American Realty Capital Retail Advisor, LLC, which manages the day-to-day affairs of the Company and is also controlled by AR Global.  Finally, the Proxy Statement improperly bundles multiple unrelated Charter amendments in single voting proposals, illegally requiring ARC-RCA shareholders to vote up or down a number of proposals collectively rather than being able to vote separately on the distinct Charter amendments.
Shareholders who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne O. Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299 – 7706 or at info@ktmc.com.  To view a copy of the complaint, or for additional information about the shareholder lawsuit, please visit https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/american-realty-capital#join.
Plaintiff is represented by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, which prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country.  Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world.  The firm represents investors, consumers and whistleblowers (private citizens who report fraudulent practices against the government and share in the recovery of government dollars).  For more information about Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or for additional information about participating in this action, please visit www.ktmc.com.  Attorney Advertising.  Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.

According to a recent article in InvestmentNews, Grant Thornton, one of the world’s leading auditing firms, has resigned from eight Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) all of which are managed by Nicholas Schorsch, including American Realty Capital. Grant Thornton gave no reason or explanation for this resignations.
Grant Thornton previously audited 16 American Realty Capital investment programs. Among those REITs which Grant Thornton resigned from last week include: ARC – Retail Centers of America, Inc., ARC – Retail Centers of America II, Inc., ARC Daly Net Asset Value Trust, Inc., ARC Healthcare Trust II, Inc. ARC Healthcare Trust II, Inc. ARC New York City REIT, Inc. and ARC Realty Finance Trust, Inc.
American Realty Capital has been in the spotlight, though not in the best light, since October 2014 when it was discovered that America Realty Capital Properties, Inc. had made a $23 million accounting error that was intentionally left uncorrected during the first half of 2014. Since then Nicholas Schorsch has resigned as Chairman of American Realty Capital Properties and the sales of American Realty Capital REITs have significantly slowed, as many broker-dealers suspended offering the product. Deloitte Touche will become the new internal auditor to all ARC-sponsored programs.
A lawsuit is currently pending, alleging that American Realty Capital violated federal securities laws and made false and misleading statements by “misrepresenting the company’s business and prospects and engaged in a scheme to deceive the market and a course of conduct that artificially inflated prices of American Realty securities.”
If you or someone you know has lost money investing through ARC – Retail Centers of America, Inc., ARC – Retail Centers of America II, Inc., ARC Daly Net Asset Value Trust, Inc., ARC Healthcare Trust II, Inc. ARC Healthcare Trust II, Inc. ARC New York City REIT, Inc. and ARC Realty Finance Trust, Inc. or any other REIT through American Realty Properties, you may be entitled to full recovery of your losses.
REITs like ARC – Retail Centers of America, Inc., ARC – Retail Centers of America II, Inc., ARC Daly Net Asset Value Trust, Inc., ARC Healthcare Trust II, Inc. ARC Healthcare Trust II, Inc. ARC New York City REIT, Inc. and ARC Realty Finance Trust, Inc. are extremely risky, and broker-dealers who offer these investments have a duty to warn investors of those risks and to only offer investments which are suitable to each investor’s needs.
