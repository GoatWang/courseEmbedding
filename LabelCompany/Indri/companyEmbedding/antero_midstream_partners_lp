Legal Notice
Certain information in this website includes forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this website, regarding the Company’s strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions about future events. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements herein include the timing and extent of commodity prices for natural gas and oil, inflation, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, timing of development expenditures, and other risk factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
Furthermore, while the business results of certain companies for which management was previously employed, and the experience management gained from their previous employment, are discussed herein, management’s past performance does not guarantee the Company’s future success, and the Company can provide no assurances that its operational or financial results will be the same as or similar to those achieved by the companies for which management was previously employed. Various factors could cause the Company’s results to differ significantly from the past performance of the companies for which management was previously employed, including the Company’s ability to:

access sufficient capital to fund its business plan;
locate and acquire reserves; and
produce and market natural gas and oil.

Any or all of these factors, together with other factors, may cause the Company’s results to differ significantly from the results of companies for which management was previously employed.

Delivering Energy For A Bright Future





Midstream Operations


Antero Midstream’s assets consist of gathering pipelines, compression stations, processing and fractionation plants and water handling and treatment infrastructure through which Antero Midstream provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation and integrated water services to Antero Resources under long-term, fixed-fee service agreements. 
Antero Midstream had a combined 307 miles of low- and high-pressure pipeline in the Marcellus and Utica Shales by the end of 2016. Our gathering pipeline infrastructure includes a network of 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-inch pipelines that collect raw natural gas from Antero Resources’ operations. In support of our gathering operations, we had compression capacity of 1,135 MMcf/d. In addition, we have a system of condensate gathering pipelines to collect wellhead condensate associated with Antero Resources’ liquids rich production in the Utica Shale. Our fresh water handling operations, which are based in both the Marcellus and Utica Shales, comprise 286 miles of fresh water pipeline and 36 fresh water impoundments.
In 2016, Antero Midstream gathered approximately 1,403 MMcf/d of natural gas through our low-pressure lines, 1,316 MMcf/d of natural gas through high-pressure lines and 1,000 Bbl/d of condensate through our condensate gathering lines under fee-based contracts with Antero Resources.  During this period, we also compressed 741 MMcf/d of natural gas and delivered 123 MBbl/d of freshwater to Antero Resources for its completion operations. 
Antero Midstream is committed to operational safety and environmental stewardship. As we strive to protect the natural environment and minimize the impact of our operations, Antero Midstream pipeline is buried underground and identified by marked rights-of-way. Visit Pipeline Safety to learn more about Antero Midstream’s efforts to ensure the safety and protection of the communities in which we live, work and operate.

Safe & Efficient Transport





Pipeline Safety
Pipelines are the safest and most efficient way to transport natural gas and hydrocarbons. History has shown this, but to design, build and operate pipelines safely is dependent not only on the energy industry, but the public must do their part as well.
Our natural gas gathering and compression activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Antero Midstream works to ensure that all of our pipelines and facilities are constructed, maintained and operated at a level that meets all federal, state and local regulations.

As part of this agreement, Antero Midstream has agreed to release to the joint venture its 195,000 gross acre processing dedication from Antero Resources, increasing the Marcellus Shale area dedication to MarkWest from approximately 167,000 gross operated acres to over 360,000 gross operated acres. The additional dedicated acreage includes Antero Resources` core Marcellus Shale position in Tyler, Wetzel, and Ritchie counties of West Virginia.To support Antero Resources` significant production growth profile, the joint venture will expand processing infrastructure at its Sherwood Complex in Doddridge County, West Virginia. The Sherwood Complex began operations in October 2012 and has grown to become the single largest gas processing complex in the Northeast, currently with six cryogenic processing facilities totaling 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity.Ongoing development of gas processing infrastructure at the Sherwood Complex includes three new joint venture processing facilities, totaling 600 million cubic feet per day of incremental capacity for Antero Resources. The joint venture expects to commence operations of two of the new facilities during the first quarter and third quarter of 2017, and the third new facility during the first quarter of 2018. In addition to the three new processing facilities, the joint venture contemplates the development of up to another eight processing facilities to support Antero Resources, which would be located at both the Sherwood Complex and a new location in West Virginia.MarkWest will continue to construct and operate all processing facilities installed to service Antero Resources` production and will also retain full ownership of the first six processing facilities at the Sherwood Complex.In addition to the development of gas processing infrastructure, the joint venture will support the growth of Antero Resources` natural gas liquids (NGL) production with fractionation infrastructure at the Hopedale Complex in Harrison County, Ohio. The largest fractionation facility in the Marcellus and Utica shales, the Hopedale Complex currently has three units providing 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) of propane-plus fractionation capacity. The joint venture is investing in 20,000 bpd of existing fractionation capacity at the Hopedale Complex, and has an option to invest in future fractionation expansions at the complex subject to the production of incremental NGLs from the joint venture`s processing facilities. MarkWest and its affiliates will continue to fully own and operate all NGL pipelines, rail and marketing infrastructure associated with the Hopedale Complex. In addition, MarkWest will continue to fully own and operate all fractionation facilities and related NGL infrastructure in the Marcellus Shale. MarkWest will initially contribute existing assets to the joint venture consisting of the three processing facilities currently under construction at the Sherwood Complex, as well as associated infrastructure related to the operation of these facilities. Antero Midstream will initially contribute approximately $155 million for its allocated share of processing assets at the Sherwood Complex and ownership of fractionation capacity at the Hopedale Complex. Going forward, it is expected that MarkWest and Antero Midstream will each contribute 50 percent of the future capital investments for the joint venture."MPLX is excited to continue expanding our midstream operations on behalf of Antero Resources by partnering with Antero Midstream," commented MPLX President Don Templin. "This unique transaction further strengthens our long-term relationship with the largest producer in the Appalachian Basin and provides MPLX with substantial future organic growth opportunities."  Read More# # #About MPLX LPMPLX is a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.45      Net Money Flow ($)  -2.54 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
