It is EPI's mission to achieve worldwide leadership in high technology products and systems based on smart material technology. In taking this multi-industry enabling technology to the edge, ETREMA has created three key business areas. They are Terfenol-D material sales, manufacture of devices powered by Terfenol-D and engineering services to assist customers in the development of new products based on ETREMA Terfenol-D®.
