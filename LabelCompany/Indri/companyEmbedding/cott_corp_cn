Coke's stock leads Dow decliners, Pepsi shares fall after BMO downgrades
Shares of Coca-Cola Co.  slumped 0.9% and PepsiCo Inc.'s stock  dropped 0.4% in morning trade Wednesday, after the non-alcoholic beverage giants were downgraded at BMO Capital, due primarily because of valuation. Coke's stock was the leading decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Analyst Amit Sharma cut his ratings on the companies to market perform from outperform, saying "it's difficult to argue for meaningful multiple expansion from current levels, particularly given that earnings growth is unlikely to significantly accelerate in the next 12-18 months." Coke's stock closed Tuesday 1.9% below its April 4, 2016 record close of $46.89, while Pepsi's stock closed 0.3% below its May 30, 2017 record of $118.01. Sharma doesn't expect the stocks to sell off, however, as he believes an investor focus on "safety" and the reversal of the "Trump trade" that had boosted economically sensitive sectors after the election, could continue to support current elevated valuations for the consumer staples sector heavyweights. Separately, Sharma upgraded rivals Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  and Cott Corp.  to outperform from market perform, citing "depressed" valuation and "more attractive" earnings growth potential. The SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF  has run up 10.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Coke's stock leads Dow decliners, Pepsi shares fall after BMO downgrades
Shares of Coca-Cola Co.  slumped 0.9% and PepsiCo Inc.'s stock  dropped 0.4% in morning trade Wednesday, after the non-alcoholic beverage giants were downgraded at BMO Capital, due primarily because of valuation. Coke's stock was the leading decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Analyst Amit Sharma cut his ratings on the companies to market perform from outperform, saying "it's difficult to argue for meaningful multiple expansion from current levels, particularly given that earnings growth is unlikely to significantly accelerate in the next 12-18 months." Coke's stock closed Tuesday 1.9% below its April 4, 2016 record close of $46.89, while Pepsi's stock closed 0.3% below its May 30, 2017 record of $118.01. Sharma doesn't expect the stocks to sell off, however, as he believes an investor focus on "safety" and the reversal of the "Trump trade" that had boosted economically sensitive sectors after the election, could continue to support current elevated valuations for the consumer staples sector heavyweights. Separately, Sharma upgraded rivals Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  and Cott Corp.  to outperform from market perform, citing "depressed" valuation and "more attractive" earnings growth potential. The SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF  has run up 10.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to further the reader's understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our Company. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (our "2016 Annual Report"). These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks referred to under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A in our 2016 Annual Report. As used herein, "Cott," "the Company," "Cott Corporation," "we," "us," or "our" refers to Cott Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  Overview  Cott is a diversified beverage company with a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European home and office delivery ("HOD") industry for bottled water, a leader in custom coffee roasting and blending of iced tea for the U.S. foodservice industry, and a leader in the production of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors. Our platform reaches over 2.3 million customers or delivery points across North America and Europe supported by strategically located sales and distribution facilities and fleets, as well as wholesalers and distributors. This enables us to efficiently service residences, businesses, restaurant chains, hotels and motels, small and large retailers, and healthcare facilities.  The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our purchases of raw materials and related accounts payable fluctuate based upon the demand for our products as well as the timing of the fruit growing seasons. The seasonality of our sales volume combined with the seasonal nature of fruit growing causes our working capital needs to fluctuate throughout the year, with inventory levels increasing in the first half of the year in order to meet high summer demand. In addition, our accounts receivable balances decline in the fall as customers pay their higher-than-average outstanding balances from the summer deliveries.  Our traditional business, which refers to our Cott North America, Cott U.K. and All Other reporting segments, typically operates at low margins and therefore relatively small changes in cost structures can materially affect results. Industry-wide carbonated soft drinks ("CSD") sales have declined during 2017 and 2016 and ingredient and packaging costs have remained volatile.  Ingredient and packaging costs represent a significant portion of our cost of sales. These costs are subject to global and regional commodity price trends. Our most significant commodities are aluminum in the case of cans and ends, green coffee, polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") resin, high-density polyethylene ("HDPE") and polycarbonate, corn in the case of high fructose corn syrup ("HFCS"), sugar, fruit and fruit concentrates and fuel. We attempt to manage our exposure to fluctuations in ingredient and packaging costs by entering into fixed price commitments for a portion of our ingredient and packaging requirements and implementing price increases as needed.  We supply Walmart and its affiliated companies, under annual non-exclusive supply agreements, with a variety of products in North America, the United Kingdom, and Mexico, including CSDs, 100% shelf stable juice and juice-based products, clear, still and sparkling flavored waters, bottled water, energy products, sports products, new age beverages, and ready-to-drink teas. During the first three months of 2017, we supplied Walmart with all of its private-label CSDs in the United States. In the event Walmart were to utilize additional suppliers to fulfill a portion of its requirements for CSDs, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Sales to Walmart for the three months ended April 1, 2017 and April 2, 2016 accounted for 13.0% and 18.2%, respectively, of total revenue.  We conduct operations in countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange risks to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. As our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, change in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations.  During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of Aquaterra Corporation followed by the acquisitions of S. & D. Coffee, Inc. ("S&D") and Eden Springs Europe B.V. ("Eden") in the third quarter of 2016. These businesses were added to our DSS reporting segment, which was then renamed "Water & Coffee Solutions" to reflect the increased scope of our offering. Other than the change in name, there was no impact on prior period results for this reporting segment. The Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment produces a product category consisting primarily of bottled water, coffee, brewed tea, water dispensers, coffee and tea brewers and filtration equipment.  Table of Contents  Financing Transactions  On March 22, 2017, we issued $750.0 million of 5.500% senior notes due April 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes") to qualified purchasers in a private placement offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States to non-U.S. purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act and other applicable laws. The 2025 Notes were issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary Cott Holdings Inc., and most of our U.S., Canadian, U.K., Luxembourg and Dutch subsidiaries guarantee the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes will mature on April 1, 2025 and interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year commencing on October 1, 2017. The proceeds of the 2025 Notes were used to retire $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), redeem $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 10.000% senior secured notes due 2021 (the "DSS Notes") and to pay related fees and expenses.  We incurred $11.6 million of financing fees in connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes. The financing fees are being amortized using the effective interest method over an eight-year period, which represents the term to maturity of the 2025 Notes.  Forward-Looking Statements  In addition to historical information, this report, and any documents incorporated in this report by reference, may contain statements relating to future events and future results. These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities legislation and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, future expectations and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Cott Corporation to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements that relate to projections of sales, earnings, earnings per share, cash flows, capital expenditures or other financial items, statements regarding our intentions to pay regular quarterly dividends on our common shares, and discussions of estimated future revenue enhancements and cost savings. These statements also relate to our business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources. Generally, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "endeavor," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "will," "plan," "predict," "project," "should" and similar terms and phrases are used to identify forward-looking statements in this report and any documents incorporated in this report by reference. These forward-looking statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and are made only as of the date of this report.  The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and, by their nature, are based on certain estimates and assumptions regarding interest and foreign exchange rates, expected growth, results of operations, performance, business prospects and opportunities and effective income tax rates, which are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making an estimate set out in forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, assumptions regarding management's current plans and estimates, our ability to remain a low cost supplier, and effective management of commodity costs. Although we believe the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could prove to be incorrect. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and any one or any combination of these risks and uncertainties could also affect whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2016 Annual Report, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Canadian securities regulatory authorities.  The following are some of the factors that could affect our financial performance, including but not limited to, sales, earnings and cash flows, or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in or underlying the forward-looking statements:   our ability to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate;   changes in consumer tastes and preferences for existing products and our ability to develop and timely launch new products that appeal to such changing consumer tastes and preferences;   a loss of or a reduction in business in our traditional business with key customers, particularly Walmart;   consolidation of retail customers in the markets in which we operate;   fluctuations in commodity prices and our ability to pass on increased costs to our customers or effectively hedge against such rising costs, and the impact of those increased prices on our volumes;   our ability to manage our operations successfully;   our ability to fully realize the potential benefit of acquisitions or other strategic opportunities that we pursue;  Table of Contents   the limited nature of our indemnification rights under our recent acquisition agreements;   the incurrence of substantial indebtedness to finance our recent acquisitions;   our exposure to intangible asset risk;   currency fluctuations that adversely affect the exchange between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and other currencies, and the exchange between the British pound sterling and the Euro;   our ability to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with our suppliers;   our substantial indebtedness and our ability to meet our obligations under our debt agreements, and risks of further increases to our indebtedness;   our ability to maintain compliance with the covenants and conditions under our debt agreements;   fluctuations in interest rates which could increase our borrowing costs;   credit rating changes;   the impact of global financial events on our financial results;   our ability to fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring activities;   any disruption to production at our beverage concentrates or other manufacturing facilities;   our ability to maintain access to our water sources;   our ability to adequately address the challenges and risks associated with our international operations and acquisition strategy;   our ability to protect our intellectual property;   compliance with product health and safety standards;   liability for injury or illness caused by the consumption of contaminated products;   liability and damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or legal proceedings;   changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate;   the impact of proposed taxes on soda and other sugary drinks;   enforcement of compliance with the Ontario Environmental Protection Act;   the seasonal nature of our business and the effect of adverse weather conditions;   the impact of national, regional and global events, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature;   our ability to recruit, retain, and integrate new members of management;   our ability to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms;   disruptions in our information systems;   our ability to securely maintain our customers' confidential or credit card information, or other private data relating to our employees or our company;   increased tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate; or   our ability to maintain our quarterly dividend;  We undertake no obligation to update any information contained in this report or to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances of which we may become aware of after the date of this report. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, and all future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing.  Table of Contents  Non-GAAP Measures  In this report, we supplement our reporting of financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP by utilizing certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items to make period-over-period comparisons for our underlying operations before material changes.  We exclude these items to better understand trends in the business. We exclude the impact of foreign exchange to separate the impact of currency exchange rate changes from our results of operations.  We also utilize (loss) earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), which is GAAP (loss) income attributed to Cott Corporation before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We also utilize adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA excluding acquisition and integration costs, inventory step-up adjustments, unrealized gain on commodity hedging instruments, net, foreign exchange and other gains, net, loss on disposal of property, plant & equipment, net, loss on extinguishment of 2020 Notes, share-based compensation costs, and other adjustments, as the case may be ("Adjusted EBITDA"). Effective January 1, 2017, share-based compensation expense, as a part of annual compensation packages, is included as an adjustment to EBITDA, and prior periods presented have been updated to incorporate the change. This determination is based upon review of peer companies and business practices among entities undergoing transformation within their operations. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items to make more meaningful period-over-period comparisons of our underlying operations before material changes.  We also utilize adjusted net loss, which is GAAP loss attributed to Cott Corporation excluding acquisition and integration costs, inventory step-up adjustments, unrealized gain on commodity hedging instruments, net, foreign exchange and other gains, net, loss on disposal of property, plant & equipment, net, loss on extinguishment of 2020 Notes, other adjustments, and the tax effect of adjustments, as well as adjusted net loss per diluted common share, which is adjusted net loss divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We consider these measures to be indicators of our operating performance.  Additionally, we supplement our reporting of net cash used in operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP by excluding additions to property, plant & equipment to present free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (which is free cash flow excluding acquisition and integration cash costs), which management believes provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, paying dividends, and strengthening the balance sheet.  Because we use these adjusted financial results in the management of our business and to understand underlying business performance, we believe this supplemental information is useful to investors for their independent evaluation and understanding of our business performance and the performance of our management. The non-GAAP financial measures described above are in addition to, and not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this report reflect our judgment of particular items, and may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Summary Financial Results  Net loss attributed to Cott Corporation for the three months ended April 1, 2017 (the "first quarter") was $36.4 million or $0.26 net loss per diluted common share, compared with net loss of $2.8 million or $0.02 per diluted common share for the three months ended April 2, 2016.  The following items of significance affected our financial results for the first quarter of 2017:   Net revenue increased 28.4% from the prior year period due primarily to the addition of the S&D and Eden businesses as well as growth in our DSS business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a product mix shift and the competitive landscape in our traditional business. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net revenue increased 30.3% from the prior year period;   Gross profit for the first quarter increased to $310.6 million from $214.0 million in the prior year period due primarily to the addition of the S&D and Eden businesses and operational improvements in our DSS business, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower volumes in our Cott U.K. reporting segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to 34.6% for the first quarter from 30.6% in the prior year period;  Table of Contents   Other expense, net for the first quarter was $8.4 million compared to other income, net of $2.2 million in the prior year period due primarily to the costs associated with the redemption of our 2020 Notes;   Interest expense, net for the first quarter increased to $35.7 million from $27.8 million in the prior year period due primarily to the issuance of our ?450.0 million (U.S. $480.7 million at the exchange rate in effect on April 1, 2017) of 5.500% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") in the second quarter of the prior year;   Income tax expense for the first quarter was $1.1 million compared to income tax benefit of $9.5 million in the prior year period due primarily to no longer recognizing tax benefits in the U.S. and Canada.   Adjusted EBITDA increased to $88.1 million in the first quarter compared to $72.9 million in the prior year period due to the items listed above;   Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted common share were $18.5 million and $0.13 respectively, in the first quarter compared to adjusted net loss of $2.0 million and adjusted net loss per diluted common share of $0.02 in the prior year period; and   Cash flows used in operating activities was $3.7 million in the first quarter compared to $18.7 million in the prior year period. The $15.0 million decrease was due primarily to the change in working capital account balances relative to the prior year period.

History[edit]
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, and his son Harry, in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Canada, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec, Canada, in 1952. In 1955 Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the US and into Europe.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, labels for its products were printed with the slogan "It's Cott to be good". Vess Beverage assets and its division, Vess Specialty Packaging Company, was purchased in 1994.[4] In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.[5]
From 1992 to 1996, Cott was headed by Heather Reisman, founder of Indigo Books & Music.
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group.[6] In April 2007, Cott was said to be considering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business.[7] In 2007, in conjunction with the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, Cott partnered with 7-Eleven to produce "Buzz Cola", a fictional soda found in the The Simpsons television series.[8] In late February 2008, Cott was served notice by its key customer, Wal-Mart, that shelf space for some soft drinks made by Cott for them would be reduced.[9] Nearly a year later in January 2009, Wal-Mart informed Cott it was terminating a 10-year-old exclusive supply contract under which Cott had been exclusively supplying the company with store-branded soft drinks.[10] Notwithstanding the termination of the exclusive supply contract, Cott continues to supply Wal-Mart under annual non-exclusive supply agreements.
In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-branded beverages.[11]
In November 2014, Cott Corporation announced it had agreed a deal to acquire U.S. direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor DSS Group Inc for a fee of $1.25 billion.[12]

Red Rooster is a mixed fruit flavour energy drink brand aimed at the same market sector as Red Bull.[13] It is packaged in slim 250 ml (8.8 imp fl oz; 8.5 US fl oz) cans or in 1 litre (35.2 imp fl oz; 33.8 US fl oz) bottles. It is available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK) in Morrisons, Iceland, Total S.A., Farmfoods, Asda and the Co-op UK, in Mace, Dunnes Stores in Ireland, and in Match supermarkets in Hungary.[citation needed] Asda originally launched it under the in-house brand name of Blue Charge.[14]
MacB is a brand of flavored water, mainly sold in Scotland. Flavors include Kiwi and Banana and Strawberry and Apple. The drink is currently the main sponsor of Scottish Premiership football team Partick Thistle.[15]
Cott's 24, The Series is the name given to the 440 and 500 ml (15.5 and 17.6 imp fl oz; 14.9 and 16.9 US fl oz) can version of the product. It is sold mostly in UK discount stores. The name of the drink comes from the American television series 24. The drink's advertising slogan is "Every second counts!", which ties into the real-time nature of the television series. It is formulated with 32 milligrams (0.0011 oz) of caffeine per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz). A diet version is now being introduced in some UK stores.
Blue Charge is the brand name of an energy drink, produced in the UK by Cott for Asda[14] as an alternative to such products as Red Bull and Powerade.[13] Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (sodium citrates), fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).[16] The drink has a high caffeine content (30 mg/100ml).[16]
Cola is a carbonated cola-flavored soft drink produced by Cott's Tampa, FL plant and sold in some Wal-Mart stores. Outside the United States, Cott distributes RC Cola.
Most products produced by Cott are certified Kosher. Any certified product in the US or Canada carries a kosher symbol on the label.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2012, Cott purchased Sangs Soft Drinks, based in Macduff, Scotland.[17]
In June 2016, Cott purchased Eden Springs for $525 million from Rhone Group.[18]
In 2016 Cott purchased S&D Coffee, a privately held coffee roaster located in Concord, North Carolina.
In 2017 Cott acquired Decantae mineral water ltd, located in North Wales, United Kingdom.

History[edit]
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, and his son Harry, in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Canada, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec, Canada, in 1952. In 1955 Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the US and into Europe.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, labels for its products were printed with the slogan "It's Cott to be good". Vess Beverage assets and its division, Vess Specialty Packaging Company, was purchased in 1994.[4] In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.[5]
From 1992 to 1996, Cott was headed by Heather Reisman, founder of Indigo Books & Music.
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group.[6] In April 2007, Cott was said to be considering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business.[7] In 2007, in conjunction with the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, Cott partnered with 7-Eleven to produce "Buzz Cola", a fictional soda found in the The Simpsons television series.[8] In late February 2008, Cott was served notice by its key customer, Wal-Mart, that shelf space for some soft drinks made by Cott for them would be reduced.[9] Nearly a year later in January 2009, Wal-Mart informed Cott it was terminating a 10-year-old exclusive supply contract under which Cott had been exclusively supplying the company with store-branded soft drinks.[10] Notwithstanding the termination of the exclusive supply contract, Cott continues to supply Wal-Mart under annual non-exclusive supply agreements.
In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-branded beverages.[11]
In November 2014, Cott Corporation announced it had agreed a deal to acquire U.S. direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor DSS Group Inc for a fee of $1.25 billion.[12]

Red Rooster is a mixed fruit flavour energy drink brand aimed at the same market sector as Red Bull.[13] It is packaged in slim 250 ml (8.8 imp fl oz; 8.5 US fl oz) cans or in 1 litre (35.2 imp fl oz; 33.8 US fl oz) bottles. It is available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK) in Morrisons, Iceland, Total S.A., Farmfoods, Asda and the Co-op UK, in Mace, Dunnes Stores in Ireland, and in Match supermarkets in Hungary.[citation needed] Asda originally launched it under the in-house brand name of Blue Charge.[14]
MacB is a brand of flavored water, mainly sold in Scotland. Flavors include Kiwi and Banana and Strawberry and Apple. The drink is currently the main sponsor of Scottish Premiership football team Partick Thistle.[15]
Cott's 24, The Series is the name given to the 440 and 500 ml (15.5 and 17.6 imp fl oz; 14.9 and 16.9 US fl oz) can version of the product. It is sold mostly in UK discount stores. The name of the drink comes from the American television series 24. The drink's advertising slogan is "Every second counts!", which ties into the real-time nature of the television series. It is formulated with 32 milligrams (0.0011 oz) of caffeine per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz). A diet version is now being introduced in some UK stores.
Blue Charge is the brand name of an energy drink, produced in the UK by Cott for Asda[14] as an alternative to such products as Red Bull and Powerade.[13] Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (sodium citrates), fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).[16] The drink has a high caffeine content (30 mg/100ml).[16]
Cola is a carbonated cola-flavored soft drink produced by Cott's Tampa, FL plant and sold in some Wal-Mart stores. Outside the United States, Cott distributes RC Cola.
Most products produced by Cott are certified Kosher. Any certified product in the US or Canada carries a kosher symbol on the label.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2012, Cott purchased Sangs Soft Drinks, based in Macduff, Scotland.[17]
In June 2016, Cott purchased Eden Springs for $525 million from Rhone Group.[18]
In 2016 Cott purchased S&D Coffee, a privately held coffee roaster located in Concord, North Carolina.
In 2017 Cott acquired Decantae mineral water ltd, located in North Wales, United Kingdom.

History[edit]
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, and his son Harry, in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Canada, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec, Canada, in 1952. In 1955 Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the US and into Europe.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, labels for its products were printed with the slogan "It's Cott to be good". Vess Beverage assets and its division, Vess Specialty Packaging Company, was purchased in 1994.[4] In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.[5]
From 1992 to 1996, Cott was headed by Heather Reisman, founder of Indigo Books & Music.
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group.[6] In April 2007, Cott was said to be considering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business.[7] In 2007, in conjunction with the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, Cott partnered with 7-Eleven to produce "Buzz Cola", a fictional soda found in the The Simpsons television series.[8] In late February 2008, Cott was served notice by its key customer, Wal-Mart, that shelf space for some soft drinks made by Cott for them would be reduced.[9] Nearly a year later in January 2009, Wal-Mart informed Cott it was terminating a 10-year-old exclusive supply contract under which Cott had been exclusively supplying the company with store-branded soft drinks.[10] Notwithstanding the termination of the exclusive supply contract, Cott continues to supply Wal-Mart under annual non-exclusive supply agreements.
In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-branded beverages.[11]
In November 2014, Cott Corporation announced it had agreed a deal to acquire U.S. direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor DSS Group Inc for a fee of $1.25 billion.[12]

Red Rooster is a mixed fruit flavour energy drink brand aimed at the same market sector as Red Bull.[13] It is packaged in slim 250 ml (8.8 imp fl oz; 8.5 US fl oz) cans or in 1 litre (35.2 imp fl oz; 33.8 US fl oz) bottles. It is available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK) in Morrisons, Iceland, Total S.A., Farmfoods, Asda and the Co-op UK, in Mace, Dunnes Stores in Ireland, and in Match supermarkets in Hungary.[citation needed] Asda originally launched it under the in-house brand name of Blue Charge.[14]
MacB is a brand of flavored water, mainly sold in Scotland. Flavors include Kiwi and Banana and Strawberry and Apple. The drink is currently the main sponsor of Scottish Premiership football team Partick Thistle.[15]
Cott's 24, The Series is the name given to the 440 and 500 ml (15.5 and 17.6 imp fl oz; 14.9 and 16.9 US fl oz) can version of the product. It is sold mostly in UK discount stores. The name of the drink comes from the American television series 24. The drink's advertising slogan is "Every second counts!", which ties into the real-time nature of the television series. It is formulated with 32 milligrams (0.0011 oz) of caffeine per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz). A diet version is now being introduced in some UK stores.
Blue Charge is the brand name of an energy drink, produced in the UK by Cott for Asda[14] as an alternative to such products as Red Bull and Powerade.[13] Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (sodium citrates), fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).[16] The drink has a high caffeine content (30 mg/100ml).[16]
Cola is a carbonated cola-flavored soft drink produced by Cott's Tampa, FL plant and sold in some Wal-Mart stores. Outside the United States, Cott distributes RC Cola.
Most products produced by Cott are certified Kosher. Any certified product in the US or Canada carries a kosher symbol on the label.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2012, Cott purchased Sangs Soft Drinks, based in Macduff, Scotland.[17]
In June 2016, Cott purchased Eden Springs for $525 million from Rhone Group.[18]
In 2016 Cott purchased S&D Coffee, a privately held coffee roaster located in Concord, North Carolina.
In 2017 Cott acquired Decantae mineral water ltd, located in North Wales, United Kingdom.

History[edit]
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, and his son Harry, in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Canada, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec, Canada, in 1952. In 1955 Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the US and into Europe.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, labels for its products were printed with the slogan "It's Cott to be good". Vess Beverage assets and its division, Vess Specialty Packaging Company, was purchased in 1994.[4] In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.[5]
From 1992 to 1996, Cott was headed by Heather Reisman, founder of Indigo Books & Music.
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group.[6] In April 2007, Cott was said to be considering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business.[7] In 2007, in conjunction with the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, Cott partnered with 7-Eleven to produce "Buzz Cola", a fictional soda found in the The Simpsons television series.[8] In late February 2008, Cott was served notice by its key customer, Wal-Mart, that shelf space for some soft drinks made by Cott for them would be reduced.[9] Nearly a year later in January 2009, Wal-Mart informed Cott it was terminating a 10-year-old exclusive supply contract under which Cott had been exclusively supplying the company with store-branded soft drinks.[10] Notwithstanding the termination of the exclusive supply contract, Cott continues to supply Wal-Mart under annual non-exclusive supply agreements.
In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-branded beverages.[11]
In November 2014, Cott Corporation announced it had agreed a deal to acquire U.S. direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor DSS Group Inc for a fee of $1.25 billion.[12]

Red Rooster is a mixed fruit flavour energy drink brand aimed at the same market sector as Red Bull.[13] It is packaged in slim 250 ml (8.8 imp fl oz; 8.5 US fl oz) cans or in 1 litre (35.2 imp fl oz; 33.8 US fl oz) bottles. It is available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK) in Morrisons, Iceland, Total S.A., Farmfoods, Asda and the Co-op UK, in Mace, Dunnes Stores in Ireland, and in Match supermarkets in Hungary.[citation needed] Asda originally launched it under the in-house brand name of Blue Charge.[14]
MacB is a brand of flavored water, mainly sold in Scotland. Flavors include Kiwi and Banana and Strawberry and Apple. The drink is currently the main sponsor of Scottish Premiership football team Partick Thistle.[15]
Cott's 24, The Series is the name given to the 440 and 500 ml (15.5 and 17.6 imp fl oz; 14.9 and 16.9 US fl oz) can version of the product. It is sold mostly in UK discount stores. The name of the drink comes from the American television series 24. The drink's advertising slogan is "Every second counts!", which ties into the real-time nature of the television series. It is formulated with 32 milligrams (0.0011 oz) of caffeine per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz). A diet version is now being introduced in some UK stores.
Blue Charge is the brand name of an energy drink, produced in the UK by Cott for Asda[14] as an alternative to such products as Red Bull and Powerade.[13] Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (sodium citrates), fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).[16] The drink has a high caffeine content (30 mg/100ml).[16]
Cola is a carbonated cola-flavored soft drink produced by Cott's Tampa, FL plant and sold in some Wal-Mart stores. Outside the United States, Cott distributes RC Cola.
Most products produced by Cott are certified Kosher. Any certified product in the US or Canada carries a kosher symbol on the label.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2012, Cott purchased Sangs Soft Drinks, based in Macduff, Scotland.[17]
In June 2016, Cott purchased Eden Springs for $525 million from Rhone Group.[18]
In 2016 Cott purchased S&D Coffee, a privately held coffee roaster located in Concord, North Carolina.
In 2017 Cott acquired Decantae mineral water ltd, located in North Wales, United Kingdom.

	Cott Reports First Quarter 2017 Results



	(Unless stated otherwise, all first quarter 2017 comparisons
	are relative to the first quarter of 2016; all information is in U.S. dollars.)


	TORONTO and TAMPA, FL, May 4, 2017 /CNW/ - Cott Corporation
	(NYSE:COT; TSX:BCB) today announced its results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2017.



	FIRST QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS      








	·




	Cott revenue increased 28% to $896 million compared
	to $698 million.










	·




	Gross profit increased 45% to $311 million compared
	to $214 million and gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 34.6% compared to 30.6%.










	·




	Net cash used in operating activities of $5 million
	less $41 million of capital expenditures resulted in reported free cash flow usage of ($46) million and adjusted free cash flow
	usage of ($40) million (adjusted for acquisition, integration, and other cash costs) compared to adjusted free cash flow usage
	of ($47) million in the prior year representing a $7 million or 15% improvement.










	·




	Issued $750 million of Senior Notes at a rate of 5.5%
	and an 8 year maturity with the proceeds to be utilized to redeem all $625 million of our 6.75% Senior Notes and $100 million of
	our 10% Senior Notes.










	·




	Cott continues to target full year 2017 cash flow
	provided by operations of approximately $330 to $340 million and capital expenditures in the range of $165 to $175 million, resulting
	in adjusted free cash flow of $155 to $175 million (when excluding acquisition, integration, and other cash costs).










	·




	Cott continues to target full year 2017 revenues of
	over $3.7 billion.





	"I am pleased with our results for the first quarter
	of 2017 as our water and coffee solutions segment performed well with good growth and performance at DS Services and S&D Coffee
	and Tea especially.  As expected, adverse foreign exchange rates, principally related to the devaluation of the British pound
	in relation to the U.S. dollar and the Euro, impacted the cost of goods for our Cott U.K. reporting segment during the quarter.
	We expect this headwind will be remediated by the second half of the year as all necessary pricing has been agreed upon with customers,"
	commented Jerry Fowden, Cott's Chief Executive Officer.  "Our first quarter results and improved cash flow performance
	puts us well on track to achieve our expectation of $155 to $175 million of adjusted free cash flow in 2017," continued Mr.
	Fowden.





	FIRST QUARTER 2017 GLOBAL PERFORMANCE                 








	·




	Revenue was $896 million despite $13 million of foreign
	exchange headwinds. Our reported revenue increased 28% (30% on a foreign exchange neutral basis). Revenue drivers in the quarter
	are tabulated below:

	·




	Gross profit increased 45% to $311 million, driven
	primarily by the addition of Eden Springs ("Eden") and S&D Coffee and Tea ("S&D") and improvement in
	DS Services operations, offset in part by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and lower volumes in our Cott U.K. reporting
	segment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 34.6% compared to 30.6%.










	·




	Interest expense was $36 million after the issuance
	of $750 million of Senior Notes at a rate of 5.5% and an 8 year maturity with the proceeds to be utilized to redeem all $625 million
	of our 6.75% Senior Notes and $100 million of our 10% Senior Notes.










	·




	Income tax expense was $1 million compared to income
	tax benefit of $10 million as we now place valuation allowances against North American net operating losses. Cash taxes during
	the period were minimal, with $1 million of cash taxes during the period versus $4 million of cash taxes paid in the comparable
	prior year period.










	·




	Reported net loss and net loss per diluted share were
	$36 million and $0.26, respectively, compared to reported net loss and net loss per diluted share of $3 million and $0.02, respectively.
	Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share (including adjustments for acquisition, integration, debt redemption
	and other costs) were $19 million and $0.13, respectively, compared to adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share
	of $2 million and $0.02, respectively.










	·




	Reported EBITDA was $67 million compared to $69 million
	in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $88 million (adjusted for $21 million of acquisition, integration, debt redemption,
	other costs and share-based compensation expense in the current quarter; see Exhibit 6) due primarily to the improved contributions
	from our Water and Coffee Solutions segment, offset in part by $5 million of adverse foreign exchange headwinds and lower volume
	in our Cott U.K. reporting segment.










	·




	Net cash used in operating activities of $5 million,
	less $41 million of capital expenditures resulted in free cash flow usage of ($46) million or ($40) million of adjusted free cash
	flow usage (adjusted for acquisition, integration, and other cash costs) compared to adjusted free cash flow usage of ($47) million
	in the prior year representing a $7 million or 15% improvement.






	FIRST QUARTER 2017 REPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE   






	Water and Coffee Solutions










	·




	Revenue increased 93% to $496 million driven primarily
	by the additions of S&D and Eden alongside the other items tabulated below.  Gross profit increased 70% to $262 million
	from $154 million due primarily to the additions of Eden and S&D as well as operational improvements in DS Services.

	·




	DS Services had net new customer additions of approximately
	2% during the period.  In line with expectations, DS Services revenue increased over 2% to $263 million. DS Services operating
	income was up 37% as it began to implement its operational improvement plan.










	·




	In line with our acquisition models, Eden and S&D
	contributed $89 million and $143 million of revenue, respectively.  Integration at Eden is tracking ahead of plan while S&D's
	new customer onboarding was completed during the quarter with 9% growth in coffee volume (pounds). 








	Traditional Business










	·




	Cott North America reporting segment volume was flat
	in actual cases due primarily to 5% growth in value added and sparkling water products and 9% growth in contract manufacturing
	which offset general market and private label declines in carbonated soft drinks and shelf stable juices.










	·




	Revenue was lower by 4% at $301 million due primarily
	to ongoing product mix shifts within the business.

	to $35 million or 11.4% of revenue due primarily to the phasing of our new 7.5 million annual case hotfill contract manufacturing
	agreement with full production scheduled to occur by the end of the second quarter.










	·




	Cott U.K. reporting segment volume, although in line
	with expectations, decreased 13% in actual cases due primarily to the previously announced loss of volume from a large retail customer.










	·




	Revenue decreased 22% (10% on a foreign exchange neutral
	basis) to $94 million due primarily to the adverse foreign exchange impact of the British pound and the lost customer volume which
	will be fully lapped by the end of the second quarter of 2017.

	·




	Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was lower
	at 11.8% due primarily to the adverse foreign exchange impact on commodity costs and lower volumes.  We have agreed pricing
	changes with our customers to offset the commodity cost increases caused by the weakness of the British pound that should remediate
	this adverse foreign exchange impact by the second half of the year.






	2017 FULL YEAR FOREIGN EXCHANGE, REVENUE, AND FREE CASH
	FLOW OUTLOOK



	Based on current exchange rates and the 2017 published forecasts
	of various major financial institutions, we continue to expect the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates on full year 2017 EBITDA
	to be $12 to $18 million.


	Cott continues to target full year 2017 consolidated revenue
	of over $3.7 billion, full year 2017 cash flow provided by operations of approximately $330 to $340 million and capital expenditures
	in the range of $165 to $175 million, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $155 to $175 million (when excluding acquisition,
	integration, and other cash costs).

	ABOUT COTT CORPORATION



	Cott is a diversified beverage company with a leading volume-based
	national presence in the North America and European home and office bottled water delivery industry, a leader in custom coffee
	roasting and blending of iced tea for the U.S. foodservice industry, and one of the world's largest producers of beverages on behalf
	of retailers, brand owners, and distributors.  Our platform reaches over 2.3 million customers or delivery points across North
	America and Europe supported by strategically located sales and distribution facilities and fleets, as well as wholesalers and
	distributors.  This enables us to efficiently service residences, businesses, restaurant chains, hotels and motels, small
	and large retailers, and healthcare facilities.




	Non-GAAP Measures



	To supplement its reporting of financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, Cott utilizes certain non-GAAP financial
	measures.  Cott excludes from GAAP revenue the impact of foreign exchange to separate the impact of this factor from Cott's
	results of operations. Cott utilizes adjusted net income (loss), adjusted income (loss) per diluted share, and EBITDA and adjusted
	EBITDA on a global basis to separate the impact of certain items from the underlying business.  Because Cott uses these adjusted
	financial results in the management of its business, management believes this supplemental information is useful to investors for
	their independent evaluation and understanding of Cott's underlying business performance and the performance of its management. 
	Additionally, Cott supplements its reporting of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities determined in accordance with
	GAAP by excluding additions to property, plant & equipment to present free cash flow, and by excluding acquisition, integration,
	and other cash costs to present adjusted free cash flow, which management believes provides useful information to investors about
	the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, can be used for strategic opportunities,
	including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, paying dividends, and strengthening the balance sheet. 
	The non-GAAP financial measures described above are in addition to, and not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute
	for, Cott's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this
	earnings announcement reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable
	to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.




	Safe Harbor Statements



	This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section
	21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 conveying management's expectations as to the future based on plans, estimates and projections
	at the time Cott makes the statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and Cott cautions you
	that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking
	statement. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements related to
	the execution of our strategic priorities, future financial and operating trends and results (including the impact of foreign exchange
	on  2017 results, revenue, and adjusted free cash flow) and related matters. The forward-looking statements are based on assumptions
	regarding management's current plans and estimates. Management believes these assumptions to be reasonable but there is no assurance
	that they will prove to be accurate.


	Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
	from those described in this press release include, among others: our ability to compete successfully in the markets in which we

	that appeal to such changing consumer tastes and preferences; a loss of or a reduction in business in our traditional business
	with key customers, particularly Walmart; consolidation of retail customers; fluctuations in commodity prices and our ability to
	pass on increased costs to our customers or hedge against such rising costs, and the impact of those increased prices on our volumes;
	our ability to manage our operations successfully; our ability to fully realize the potential benefit of acquisitions or other
	strategic opportunities that we pursue; our ability to realize the revenue and cost synergies of recent acquisitions because of
	integration difficulties and other challenges; the limited nature of our indemnification rights under the acquisition agreements
	for our recent acquisitions; the incurrence of substantial indebtedness to finance our recent acquisitions; significant one-time
	transaction costs in connection with our recent acquisitions; our exposure to intangible asset risk; currency fluctuations that
	adversely affect the exchange between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican
	peso and other currencies; our ability to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with our suppliers; our substantial
	indebtedness and our ability to meet our obligations under our debt agreements, and risks of further increases to our indebtedness;
	our ability to maintain compliance with the covenants and conditions under our debt agreements; fluctuations in interest rates,
	which could increase our borrowing costs; credit rating changes; the impact of global financial events on our financial results;
	our ability to fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring activities; any disruption
	to production at our beverage concentrates or other manufacturing facilities; our ability to maintain access to our water sources;
	our ability to protect our intellectual property; compliance with product health and safety standards; liability for injury or
	illness caused by the consumption of contaminated products; liability and damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or
	legal proceedings; changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate; the impact of proposed taxes on soda and
	other sugary drinks; enforcement of compliance with the Ontario Environmental Protection Act; the seasonal nature of our business
	and the effect of adverse weather conditions;  the impact of national, regional and global events, including those of a political,
	economic, business and competitive nature; our ability to recruit, retain, and integrate new management; our ability to renew our
	collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms; disruptions in our information systems; our ability to securely maintain
	our customers' confidential or credit card information, or other private data relating to our employees or our company; our ability
	to maintain our quarterly dividend; our ability to adequately address the challenges and risks associated with our international
	operations and address difficulties in complying with laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
	the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010; and our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income.


	The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Readers are
	cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Readers are urged
	to carefully review and consider the various disclosures, including but not limited to risk factors contained in Cott's Annual
	Report on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other filings with the securities commissions. Cott does
	not undertake to update or revise any of these statements in light of new information or future events, except as expressly required
	by applicable law.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, and his son Harry, in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Canada, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec, Canada, in 1952. In 1955 Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the US and into Europe.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, labels for its products were printed with the slogan "It's Cott to be good". Vess Beverage assets and its division, Vess Specialty Packaging Company, was purchased in 1994.[4] In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.[5]
From 1992 to 1996, Cott was headed by Heather Reisman, founder of Indigo Books & Music.
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group.[6] In April 2007, Cott was said to be considering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business.[7] In 2007, in conjunction with the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, Cott partnered with 7-Eleven to produce "Buzz Cola", a fictional soda found in the The Simpsons television series.[8] In late February 2008, Cott was served notice by its key customer, Wal-Mart, that shelf space for some soft drinks made by Cott for them would be reduced.[9] Nearly a year later in January 2009, Wal-Mart informed Cott it was terminating a 10-year-old exclusive supply contract under which Cott had been exclusively supplying the company with store-branded soft drinks.[10] Notwithstanding the termination of the exclusive supply contract, Cott continues to supply Wal-Mart under annual non-exclusive supply agreements.
In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-branded beverages.[11]
In November 2014, Cott Corporation announced it had agreed a deal to acquire U.S. direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor DSS Group Inc for a fee of $1.25 billion.[12]

Red Rooster is a mixed fruit flavour energy drink brand aimed at the same market sector as Red Bull.[13] It is packaged in slim 250 ml (8.8 imp fl oz; 8.5 US fl oz) cans or in 1 litre (35.2 imp fl oz; 33.8 US fl oz) bottles. It is available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK) in Morrisons, Iceland, Total S.A., Farmfoods, Asda and the Co-op UK, in Mace, Dunnes Stores in Ireland, and in Match supermarkets in Hungary.[citation needed] Asda originally launched it under the in-house brand name of Blue Charge.[14]
MacB is a brand of flavored water, mainly sold in Scotland. Flavors include Kiwi and Banana and Strawberry and Apple. The drink is currently the main sponsor of Scottish Premiership football team Partick Thistle.[15]
Cott's 24, The Series is the name given to the 440 and 500 ml (15.5 and 17.6 imp fl oz; 14.9 and 16.9 US fl oz) can version of the product. It is sold mostly in UK discount stores. The name of the drink comes from the American television series 24. The drink's advertising slogan is "Every second counts!", which ties into the real-time nature of the television series. It is formulated with 32 milligrams (0.0011 oz) of caffeine per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz). A diet version is now being introduced in some UK stores.
Blue Charge is the brand name of an energy drink, produced in the UK by Cott for Asda[14] as an alternative to such products as Red Bull and Powerade.[13] Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (sodium citrates), fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).[16] The drink has a high caffeine content (30 mg/100ml).[16]
Cola is a carbonated cola-flavored soft drink produced by Cott's Tampa, FL plant and sold in some Wal-Mart stores. Outside the United States, Cott distributes RC Cola.
Most products produced by Cott are certified Kosher. Any certified product in the US or Canada carries a kosher symbol on the label.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2012, Cott purchased Sangs Soft Drinks, based in Macduff, Scotland.[17]
In June 2016, Cott purchased Eden Springs for $525 million from Rhone Group.[18]
In 2016 Cott purchased S&D Coffee, a privately held coffee roaster located in Concord, North Carolina.
In 2017 Cott acquired Decantae mineral water ltd, located in North Wales, United Kingdom.

History[edit]
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, and his son Harry, in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Canada, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec, Canada, in 1952. In 1955 Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the US and into Europe.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, labels for its products were printed with the slogan "It's Cott to be good". Vess Beverage assets and its division, Vess Specialty Packaging Company, was purchased in 1994.[4] In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.[5]
From 1992 to 1996, Cott was headed by Heather Reisman, founder of Indigo Books & Music.
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group.[6] In April 2007, Cott was said to be considering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks business.[7] In 2007, in conjunction with the premiere of The Simpsons Movie, Cott partnered with 7-Eleven to produce "Buzz Cola", a fictional soda found in the The Simpsons television series.[8] In late February 2008, Cott was served notice by its key customer, Wal-Mart, that shelf space for some soft drinks made by Cott for them would be reduced.[9] Nearly a year later in January 2009, Wal-Mart informed Cott it was terminating a 10-year-old exclusive supply contract under which Cott had been exclusively supplying the company with store-branded soft drinks.[10] Notwithstanding the termination of the exclusive supply contract, Cott continues to supply Wal-Mart under annual non-exclusive supply agreements.
In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-branded beverages.[11]
In November 2014, Cott Corporation announced it had agreed a deal to acquire U.S. direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor DSS Group Inc for a fee of $1.25 billion.[12]

Red Rooster is a mixed fruit flavour energy drink brand aimed at the same market sector as Red Bull.[13] It is packaged in slim 250 ml (8.8 imp fl oz; 8.5 US fl oz) cans or in 1 litre (35.2 imp fl oz; 33.8 US fl oz) bottles. It is available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK) in Morrisons, Iceland, Total S.A., Farmfoods, Asda and the Co-op UK, in Mace, Dunnes Stores in Ireland, and in Match supermarkets in Hungary.[citation needed] Asda originally launched it under the in-house brand name of Blue Charge.[14]
MacB is a brand of flavored water, mainly sold in Scotland. Flavors include Kiwi and Banana and Strawberry and Apple. The drink is currently the main sponsor of Scottish Premiership football team Partick Thistle.[15]
Cott's 24, The Series is the name given to the 440 and 500 ml (15.5 and 17.6 imp fl oz; 14.9 and 16.9 US fl oz) can version of the product. It is sold mostly in UK discount stores. The name of the drink comes from the American television series 24. The drink's advertising slogan is "Every second counts!", which ties into the real-time nature of the television series. It is formulated with 32 milligrams (0.0011 oz) of caffeine per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz). A diet version is now being introduced in some UK stores.
Blue Charge is the brand name of an energy drink, produced in the UK by Cott for Asda[14] as an alternative to such products as Red Bull and Powerade.[13] Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (sodium citrates), fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).[16] The drink has a high caffeine content (30 mg/100ml).[16]
Cola is a carbonated cola-flavored soft drink produced by Cott's Tampa, FL plant and sold in some Wal-Mart stores. Outside the United States, Cott distributes RC Cola.
Most products produced by Cott are certified Kosher. Any certified product in the US or Canada carries a kosher symbol on the label.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2012, Cott purchased Sangs Soft Drinks, based in Macduff, Scotland.[17]
In June 2016, Cott purchased Eden Springs for $525 million from Rhone Group.[18]
In 2016 Cott purchased S&D Coffee, a privately held coffee roaster located in Concord, North Carolina.
In 2017 Cott acquired Decantae mineral water ltd, located in North Wales, United Kingdom.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
