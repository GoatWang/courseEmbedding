Zillow is perfect for searching homes for sale in the United States. By analyzing real estate information on millions of homes for sale across the United States, we calculate home values (Zestimates) and the Zillow Home Value Price Index. Disclaimer: School attendance zone boundaries are supplied by Pitney Bowes and are subject to change. Check with the applicable school district prior to making a decision based on these boundaries.About the ratings: GreatSchools ratings are based on a comparison of test results for all schools in the state. It is designed to be a starting point to help parents make baseline comparisons, not the only factor in selecting the right school for your family.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. In some cases, the seller will accept backup offers.

Liberty Group Holdings Closes on 2112-14 Maryland Avenue — Liberty Group Holdings


































Liberty Group Holdings is a boutique real estate acquisitions and asset management company with a specific focus on multifamily properties in core Baltimore neighborhoods.









FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASELiberty Group Holdings Closes on 2112-14 Maryland AvenueNew York,. NY, December 20, 2016Liberty Group Holdings, LLC, on behalf of an investor group, has closed on the purchase of 2112-14 Maryland Avenue, Baltimore, MD ("Property").  The Property is an 8,600 sf building with ten residential units and 4,200 sf of commercial and warehouse space.  The Property will undergo a revitalization project including custom new front wood windows painted steel grey, a new roof and common area upgrades including new carpet, paint and the addition of a coin operated laundry set up.    A key piece of the future operations of the Property hinged on pre-closing lease negotiations with the existing commercial tenants.  Several days prior to closing, both executed lease extensions to keep them in-place for four and five years, respectively, securing a place to conduct business while the neighborhood around them continues to elevate.  The Property is located in Old Goucher, two blocks north of North Avenue.  The area is witnessing strong revitalization after the population dwindled and suffered from disinvestment over the years.  Red Emma's coffee shop has attracted a young clientele to the area while Maryland Institute College of Art continues their expansion and improvement of the surrounding area.  Further north, R.House recently opened in Remington creating a food hall and gathering spot for the neighborhood and Hopkins students.  It is the opinion of Liberty Group Holdings, LLC that Station North and Remington will continue to expand creating a benefit to Old Goucher and the Property.  The Property is managed by Bay Management Group.  For residential leasing inquiries, please contact Patrick Heffernan:Patrick Heffernan | patrickh@baymgmtgroup.com | (443) 630-9494About Liberty Group HoldingsLed by Andrew Cohn and based in New York City, Liberty Group Holdings is a boutique real estate investment, development and market research firm focused on the multifamily, retail and mixed use space in Baltimore City and greater Baltimore County. LGH employs a long term approach with an eye on major improvements resulting in strong cash flows and long term value creation for our partners, residents, and surrounding communities.
