REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstMoreBy Greg Roumeliotis(Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP has decided to liquidate the two mutual funds it launched last year, regulatory filings showed this week, as the private equity firm seeks other ways to gain more traction with so-called liquid alternative funds.Developing mutual funds has historically been challenging for private equity firms because the average buyout fund is illiquid, with a typical life span of 10 years. But as these firms diversified into relatively more liquid alternative assets, such as credit and hedge funds, they have sought to widen their base beyond institutional investors.Next month, Carlyle will close Carlyle Global Core Allocation Fund, which has $50 million in net assets with a mandate to invest across equities, debt, real estate, commodities and currencies using exchange-traded funds, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Carlyle Enhanced Commodity Real Return Fund, which had a mandate to invest in asset classes such as energy and metals, but never took off, will also be wound down, according to a second filing.The move leaves Carlyle with Diversified Global Asset Management Corp (DGAM), a funds-of-hedge-funds manager it acquired in February 2014, as its main platform for launching liquid alternative products.DGAM has developed a number of liquid alternative funds aimed primarily at institutional investors, rather than the retail investors who invest in mutual funds.Some of these DGAM alternative funds could be marketed soon, according to a person with knowledge of Carlyle's plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. These products perform better in the current low-volatility market environment, rather than the high-volatility environment that the mutual funds would have thrived on, that person added.Carlyle could decide to launch another mutual fund in the future, the person said.A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment.The strategic shift comes one year after Carlyle hired Jeff Holland, a former senior executive at mutual fund conglomerate BlackRock Inc, to lead efforts to introduce alternative assets to eligible individual investors.Carlyle has also developed other products aimed at increasing the liquidity of its traditionally illiquid offerings.A captive feeder fund called CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund LLC, which allows individuals with net worth in excess of $1 million to commit as little as $50,000 to its private equity fund portfolio, had $550 million in net assets at the end of December.A business development company called Carlyle GMS Finance Inc, which lends to midsize U.S. companies, had $338.3 million in net assets at the end of last year. Carlyle plans to eventually take that vehicle public.Washington-based Carlyle, founded in 1987 by David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello, had $194 billion in assets under management as of the end of December.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhite House leakers are senior people, says ScaramucciFox BusinessEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredHere's How Much Donald Trump's Senior Adviser Anthony Scaramucci Is WorthFortuneApollo raises $24.6 billion for largest private equity fund everReutersWeWork raised $500 million to expand in ChinaBusiness Insider UKZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredHoward Marks used one of the iconic quotes of the financial crisis to highlight what's wrong with markets todayBusiness InsiderTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceMarine dog with cancer gets tear-filled farewellAssociated PressA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredGOP senators hold press conference to demand assurances that GOP health plan does not become lawBusiness InsiderTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoRolls-Royce Motor CEO: We’re not in the auto business.

We use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends," "will," "should," "may" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. Our actual results and condition could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in "Risk Factors" in our amended Registration Statement on Form 10 filed on April 11, 2013.  We have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we  Table of Contents  undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  OVERVIEW  Carlyle GMS Finance, Inc. ("GMS Finance" or the "Company") is a Maryland corporation formed on February 8, 2012, and structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. On May 2, 2013, GMS Finance filed its election to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Investment Company Act"). GMS Finance intends to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code") commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2013.  GMS Finance's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S. middle market companies with approximately $10 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). GMS Finance will seek to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in first lien senior secured and unitranche loans to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity investment firms ("Middle Market Senior Loans"). Depending on market conditions, we expect that between 70% and 80% of the value of our assets will be invested in Middle Market Senior Loans, with the balance invested in higher-yielding investments, which may include middle market junior loans such as corporate mezzanine loans, equity co-investments, broadly syndicated first lien senior secured loans and second lien loans, high-yield bonds, structured finance obligations and/or other opportunistic investments.  GMS Finance was initially funded on March 30, 2012, with the purchase of 100 shares at a net asset value ("NAV") of $20.00 per share by Carlyle GMS Investment Management L.L.C. (the "Investment Adviser"). On May 2, 2013, GMS Finance completed its initial closing of capital commitments (the "Initial Closing") and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations. As of December 31, 2012 and for the period of January 1, 2013 through May 1, 2013, GMS Finance had not commenced operations and was a development stage company as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 915, Development Stage Entity. During this time, GMS Finance focused substantially all of its efforts on establishing its business. If GMS Finance has not consummated an initial public offering of its common stock that results in an unaffiliated public float of at least 15% of the aggregate capital commitments received prior to the date of such initial public offering (a "Qualified IPO") within five years following the Initial Closing, then GMS Finance (subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will use its best efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve.  GMS Finance is an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. GMS Finance will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following an initial public offering, although if the market value of the common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, GMS Finance would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31.  Carlyle GMS Finance SPV LLC (the "Borrower Sub") is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on January 3, 2013. The Borrower Sub will invest in first lien senior secured loans and second lien loans. The Borrower Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q commencing from the date of its formation, January 3, 2013.  Table of Contents  GMS Finance is externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Carlyle GMS Finance Administration L.L.C. (the "Administrator") provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Both the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group L.P. ("Carlyle"), a global alternative asset manager publicly traded on NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "CG". Refer to the sec.gov website for further information on The Carlyle Group L.P.  As a BDC, GMS Finance is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As part of these requirements, the Company must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the Investment Company Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of its total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions).  GMS Finance intends to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code, and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, GMS Finance must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders generally at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, GMS Finance generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that it distributes to stockholders, provided that GMS Finance satisfies those requirements.  PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  The fair value of our investments was approximately $94,052 in 12 portfolio companies/structured finance obligations as of September 30, 2013. The Company had no investments as of December 31, 2012.  The Company's investment activity for the three month period ended September 30, 2013, is presented below (information presented herein is at amortized cost unless otherwise indicated).   For the three month period ended September 30, 2013 Investments-non-controlled/non-affiliated: Total Investments-non-controlled/non-affiliated as of June 30, 2013 $ 19,136 New investments 75,343 Net accretion of discount on securities 16 Investments sold or repaid (141 ) Total Investments-non-controlled/non-affiliated as of September 30, 2013 $ 94,354 Principal amount of investments purchased: First Lien Debt $ 63,149 Second Lien Debt 5,500 Structured Finance Obligations 13,382 Total $ 82,031 Principal amount of investments sold or repaid: First Lien Debt $ 142 Total $ 142 Number of new investments 11 Average new investment amount 6,847 Percentage of new investments at floating rates 100 % Percentage of new investments at fixed rates  Table of Contents  As of September 30, 2013, investments-non-controlled/non-affiliated consisted of the following:   Amortized Cost Fair Value First Lien Debt $ 81,521 $ 81,252 Second Lien Debt 5,450 5,402 Structured Finance Obligations 7,383 7,398 Total $ 94,354 $ 94,052  The weighted average yields (1), based on the amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio as of September 30, 2013, are as follows:   Amortized Cost Fair Value First Lien Debt 5.23 % 5.25 % Second Lien Debt 0.59 0.59 Structured Finance Obligations 1.67 1.68 Total 7.49 % 7.52 %  (1) Yields do not include the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of September 30, 2013.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013  The net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparison may not be meaningful.  Net investment income (loss) for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013, was as follows:   For the three month For the nine month period ended period ended September 30, 2013 September 30, 2013 Total investment income from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments $ 1,145 $ 1,165 Net expenses (1,951 ) (4,546 ) Net investment income (loss) $ (806 ) $ (3,381 )  Investment Income For the three month For the nine month period ended period ended September 30, 2013 September 30, 2013 Interest income from non- controlled/non-affiliated investments $ 1,145 $ 1,165 Total investment income $ 1,145 $ 1,165  Table of Contents  The interest income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013 is driven by our deployment of capital and increasing invested balance. As of September 30, 2013, the size of our portfolio was $94,354 at amortized cost, with total par outstanding of $101,139. As of September 30, 2013, our portfolio had a weighted average yield of 7.49% on amortized cost.

For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013, there were secured borrowings of $35,947 under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2013, $35,947 of secured borrowings were outstanding. As of December 31, 2012, there were no secured borrowings outstanding.  Base management fees and incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013 were driven by our deployment of capital and increasing invested balance. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013, we recorded an accrued capital gains incentive fees of $(13) and $0, respectively based upon our cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) as of September 30, 2013. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP") in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously  Table of Contents  recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013, we did not earn pre-incentive fee net investment income incentive fee and did not incur a realized capital gains incentive fee under the investment advisory and management agreement and therefore there are no amounts currently due under the agreement. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and base management fees.  Organization expenses include expenses incurred in the initial formation of the Company. Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs.  During the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013, the Company had a change in unrealized appreciation on 7 portfolio companies totaling approximately $281 and $322, respectively, which was offset by a change in unrealized depreciation on 7 portfolio companies totaling approximately $647 and $624, respectively.  Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation/(Depreciation) on Investments For the three month For the nine month period ended period ended September 30, 2013 September 30, 2013 Net realized gain (loss) on investments-non-controlled/non-affiliated $ 1 $ 1 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments-non-controlled/non-affiliated (366 ) (302 ) Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments $ (365 ) $ (301 )  Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013, is as follows:   For the three month period For the nine month period ended September 30, 2013 ended September 30, 2013 Net change in Net change in unrealized unrealized Net realized appreciation Net realized appreciation Type gain (loss) (depreciation) gain (loss) (depreciation) First Lien Debt $ 1 $ (333 ) $ 1 $ (269 ) Second Lien Debt - (48 ) - (48 ) Structured Finance Obligations - 15 - 15 Total $ 1 $ (366 ) $ 1 $ (302 )  Table of Contents  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company will generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Borrower Sub's Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings up to the lesser of $500,000 or the amount of capital commitments the Company has received, subject to restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act and adequate collateral to support such borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility has a three-year revolving period (with two one-year extension options, subject to the Borrower Sub's and the lenders' consent) and a maturity date six years from the Effective Date of the facility (extendable in connection with an extension of the revolving period). Base rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest initially at the applicable commercial paper rate (if the lender is a conduit lender) or LIBOR plus 1.75% per year during the revolving period, with pre-determined future interest rate increases of 1.00%-2.00% over the three years following the end of the revolving period. The Borrower Sub is also required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.25% and 1.00% per year depending on the usage of the Revolving Credit Facility. Payments under the Revolving Credit Facility are made quarterly. The lenders have a first lien security interest on all of the assets of the Borrower Sub.  The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders, and for other general corporate purposes.  As of September 30, 2013, the Company had $62,765 in cash and $35,947 indebtedness outstanding. As of September 30, 2013, $14 was available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility based on the computation of collateral to support the borrowings. As of September 30, 2013, the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility upon which commitment fees are based was $464,053. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $2 of cash and had not completed the Initial Closing, commenced operations or incurred any liabilities for outstanding borrowings.  Equity Activity  There were $540,680 and $790,795 of commitments made to the Company during the three month and nine month period ended September 30, 2013, respectively. Total commitments of the Company are $790,797 as of September 30, 2013. The Company had no commitments as of December 31, 2012, except for the initial funding by the Investment Adviser of $2.  As of September 30, 2013, $663,250 of total commitments was unfunded. As of September 30, 2013, $42,867 of total commitments were made by the Investment Adviser, members of senior management, and certain employees, partners, and affiliates of the Investment Adviser. As of September 30, 2013, certain directors have committed $1,750 in capital commitments to the Company.  Shares issued as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, were 6,477,269 and 100, respectively.

Carlyle GMS Finance, Inc.: No Action, Interpretive and/or Exemptive Letter of October 8, 2015





















Home | Previous Page





























Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Sections 16b-3
October 8, 2015
Response of the Office of Chief Counsel
Division of Corporation Finance


Re:

Carlyle  GMS Finance, Inc.
Incoming letter dated August  5, 2015


Based on the facts presented, the Division’s view is as follows.  Capitalized terms have the same meanings defined in your letter.


		For a business development company, a plan sponsored by its investment adviser that offers plan participants equity securities of the business development company is “an employee benefit plan sponsored by the issuer” for purposes of applying Exchange Act Rule 16b-3. 

		The approvals of the shareholders, the board of directors, or a committee of directors composed solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, that are conditions for the exemptions applicable to acquisitions from the issuer provided by the Exchange Act Rules 16b-3(d)(1) and 16b-3(d)(2) and dispositions to the issuer provided by Exchange Act Rule 16b-3(e), would be satisfied only by the approval of the shareholders, the board of directors, or a committee of two or more Non-Employee Directors (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 16b-3(b)(3)(ii))[1] of the business development company whose equity securities are acquired or disposed. 

		Persons who are directors of the issuer business development company, as defined in Investment Company Act Section 2(a)(12), would be eligible for the Rule 16b-3 exemption as directors. 
Persons who are officers of the issuer business development company, applying the Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(f) definition of “officer,” would be eligible for the Rule 16b-3 exemption as officers.

This position is based on the representations made to the Division in your letter.  Different facts or conditions might require different conclusions. 
Sincerely,
Carolyn Sherman
Special Counsel





[1] Exchange Act Rule 16b-3(b)(3)(ii) defines a Non-Employee Director of a closed-end investment company to mean “a director who is not an ‘interested person’ of the issuer, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.”



Incoming Letter:
The Incoming Letter is in Acrobat format.
