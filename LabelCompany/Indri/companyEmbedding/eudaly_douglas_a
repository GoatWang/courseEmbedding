Mid-winter blues got you down? We’ve got the remedy for that. Whether it’s getting outside in the darkest time of year for a European-style light festival, hearing music from one of Portland’s premiere Americana stars or meeting Portland’s brand new city commissioner, Chloe Eudaly, this week’s show is guaranteed to warm your soul.

Chloe Eudaly On Her Big Step From Indie Bookstore Owner To City Commissioner - 1:23
Chloe Eudaly started work as Portland’s newest commissioner amid a winter weather event that shut down city offices. In a town wracked by tumultuous gentrification, Eudaly is a single mom, a renter, and an eastsider who beat a much better-funded incumbent. In her first act as a commissioner, Eudaly has put up a proposal requiring landlords to pay relocation costs when tenants are evicted without cause that will go before council on Feb. 2.  April Baer sat down with Eudaly in the first of a series of conversations we plan to have over the year about what it’s like to step from selling books to writing public policy and steering the city. Listen to the extended conversation.

The Portland Winter Light Festival Shines Away the S.A.D. - 11:08
You can stay in and be cozy at this time of year; no one would blame you. But the Portland Winter Lights Festival is giving you a reason to head outside on Feb. 1–4. Now in its second year, the fest fills Portland’s waterfront between OMSI and the Zidell Yards with flashing drones, epics projections, other crazy light art and free events to celebrate the spirit of winter and the warmth of community. Oregon Art Beat producer Jule Gilfillan gives us a sneak peak.

What It Takes To Design An Iconic Album Cover - 17:32
So much goes into the making of a great record, but sometimes it’s the album art that bumps a great record into the realm of the iconic. Think about the collection of famous faces on the front of the Beatles “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” or that baby bobbing in the pool on the cover of Nirvana’s “Nevermind” or that very trippy prism on Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon.” Portland is home to many artists, and opbmusic welcomed two innovative designers, Orion Landau of the indie metal record label Relapse and Aaron Draplin of Draplin Design Company, into the studio to chat about their careers and which album covers inspire them. You can see some of their art at opbmusic.org.

PDX Jazz Brings Music And Art To The Classroom - 24:54
How do you get kids to understand a musical form that has no rules, no walls? Art can help. Volunteers with PDX Jazz have spent the winter fanning out in metro-area schools, playing music for kids and talking to them about jazz history. Teachers like Katie Robinson at Boise-Eliot/Humboldt then work with the kids on designing jazz album covers. All the students’ work will be part of a Feb. 7 art show at the Ace Hotel’s event space, The Cleaners, in Portland. The winning students will also be honored at an event held at Madison High School on Feb. 8 and in the windows of City Target in downtown Portland during the PDX Jazz Festival, Feb. 16–26.

Douglas County Voters Grapple With Their Vote To Close The Libraries - 28:39
As a kid, do you remember trips to the library? Story time? Or maybe you stop by as an adult to get books and movies or use the computers. Douglas County readers will no longer have that option. In the November election, they failed to pass a measure that would create a special taxing district to fund the libraries, and now all of the branches of the Douglas County Library System, centered around Roseburg, will close by the end of May. Listen to Think Out Loud’s full conversation with the folks grappling with what to do next.

Live Music From Americana Chameleon Tony Furtado - 34:46
Songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Tony Furtado is an Americana chameleon. He effortlessly shifts between bluegrass, folk, blues, old time and rock sounds. It’s a fascinating career arc that was beautifully captured in his most recent release, a live album called “Cider House Sessions” recorded at Portland’s Reverend Nat’s Hard Cider. On a recent icy afternoon, Furtado and fiddler, Luke Price, came into our studio to play some tunes and chat with opbmusic’s Jerad Walker.





Portland author and essayist Sallie Tisdale

Writer Sallie Tisdale on Mining the Deeply Personal - 40:31
The Portland writer Sallie Tisdale is one of Oregon’s true literary treasures. She’s the author of eight books, including “Talk Dirty to Me” and “Stepping Westward,” but she is first and foremost an essayist — someone who can make art out of her process of trying to make sense of the world. Her latest book, “Violation,” is a collection of essays that she wrote over the past three decades. Listen to her full conversation with Dave Miller at Portland’s Wordstock Literary Festival in November.

White River Junction Productions provides magazine and book editorial and production services for the railroad-oriented segment of the publishing industry. We specialize in authoring, copy-writing, editing, and magazine and book design and layout, which includes typesetting, photo scanning, and image restoration. We also maintain a photo archive of some 100,000 railroad images taken by WRJP founder and proprietor Mike Schafer starting in 1964. We are closely allied with Kevin EuDaly's Missouri-based White River Productions and invite you to visit WRP's website whiteriverproductions.com to see examples of both WRP's and WRJP's work. Kevin's White River Productions is the Number One producer of magazines for railroad historical societies, and we're proud that our White River Junction Productions has played a key role in this.

Our “Slides With Mike Schafer” photo CD series continues to grow!
In 2012, White River Junction Productions began offering its own line of products, the flagship of which is our “Slides With Mike Schafer” photo CD series. Known for his slide shows documenting his railroading adventures since 1964, Mike has traveled from coast to coast and Canada to the Gulf, sharing his slides with a wide array of railroad groups. Our photo CDs are the next best thing to Mike giving a slide show in person in your own home. Check our PRODUCT DEPOT for more information on Mike’s photo CDs and other items in our line of products.
White River Junction Productions will also be offering books in which we played a part in their production, and we also have some items for sale for the discerning railroad modeler. Do let us know what you would like to see in the way of future product offerings.
 Named for Vermont's beautiful White River and its namesake railroad junction in the southern part of the Green Mountain State—a favorite vacation and railfanning destination for proprietor Schafer—White River Junction Productions was founded in Mike's home state of Illinois in 2005, not far from the nation's railroad capital: Chicago.
