Uptick Newswire Interview with Alex Cunningham










CDIF Stock Overview with CEO Alex Cunningham













                                3 Ways to Invest with Cardiff:1. Preferred Class I Shares – Minimum Investment Required2. Direct Subsidiary Investment – Minimum Investment Required3. Cardiff Shareholder – Purchase CDIF Stock on Open Market; No Minimum




















Cardiff Platform










Preferred Class I Shares
Cardiff provides a premier alternative investment opportunity with mitigated risk in today’s small cap market. Now, accredited investors can invest directly with Cardiff through our Preferred Class “I” Shares. This tranche is designed as a discounted enhanced investment class whereby one share of Preferred Share Class I converts to 1.5 shares of Cardiff common shares. Preferred Share Class I spreads the investment across the entire Cardiff portfolio. Cardiff subsequently invests these proceeds in new acquisitions, debt conversion, subsidiary growth and operations. Phased Liquidity: “Lock-Up Period” – Shareholders are not allowed to convert and sell any shares for the first (6) months and one day. Make Whole Provision – On the date that is six months from the date of an investment in Cardiff Preferred Class “I”, should that investment have a Market Value of less the original investment amount, Cardiff would issue a number of additional shares of common stock so that the total number of shares issued has a value equal to the original investment. The Cardiff Holding Company is a pioneer offering accredited, longer term investors the opportunity to invest in one specific company while being protected by all Cardiff Subsidiaries. Investors who previously were unable to invest in Preferred Stock, now have that option. 



















				
											
												 
												







Direct Subsidiary Investment 
Cardiff also gives you the ability to invest in one or all of our subsidiaries. Cardiff’s “U” Pick option, allows accredited investors to pick which subsidiary has the most potential for future dividends and/or long-term growth. You select and invest in the subsidiary of your choice. Typically, “targeted” investment opportunities are hard to find for the average accredited investor. Most, if not all, small cap companies offer one series of Preferred Stock to key employees, VC Groups and Angels. Phased Liquidity: “Lock-Up Period” – Shareholders are not allowed to convert and sell any shares for the first (1) year. The Leak Out – Each direct subsidiary investor may then sell up to 8% each month for during months 7 to 12. Month 13 or thereafter they may, if so inclined, sell any or all remaining 44% on the open market. Not Cumulative – If you don’t sell in March, April, and May – you can still only sell 8% in June. This ensures maximum share price. The benefits of longer term Direct Subsidiary Investment could include: Reduced TaxesVarious Conversion RatesSPO – Possible future “Secondary Public Offering”Future Dividends – Determined by each Share Class

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
