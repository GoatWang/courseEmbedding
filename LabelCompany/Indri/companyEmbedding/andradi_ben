Ben Andradi and Stratford Caldecott
GK Chesterton Centre for Faith and Culture, 
    Oxford
CONFERENCE REPORT 
      "People First PLC" 
      by Ben Andradi and Stratford Caldecott 
      (Published in The Tablet on 07/02/2004) 
Businesses badly need values. Can Catholic social teaching supply them? Company directors meeting recently at 
      Worth Abbey believe so.
How do leaders of large global businesses who are also 
      Catholics make sense of their world of work in the light of 
      their faith? How can they integrate their faith and their 
      work experience? Can Catholic social teaching actually 
      be applied to the way modern businesses and organisations work? These were the key questions behind a con- 
      ference organised by business leaders and bishops at 
      Worth Abbey in West Sussex last month.
"Leadership as if Faith Mattered" was convened by the 
      Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, Kieran Conry, who sits 
      on the bishops’ World of Work committee, and hosted by 
      the Abbot of Worth,Christopher Jamison OSB. Abbot 
      Christopher, who believes the ancient Rule of St Benedict 
      is a rich source of inspiration for the modern manager, led 
      the regular sessions oflectio divina – readings of Scripture in the monastic tradition.    
The first speaker was Sr Helen Alford OP from the Angelicum University in Rome, co-author with Michael J. 
      Naughton of Managing as if Faith Mattered. She drew on 
      the idea of the "Level 5" executive who transcends mere 
      leadership, an idea developed by Jim Collins 
      (www.jimcollins.com). The "Level 5" executive, the one 
      who makes his or her company "great", is humble yet 
      fearless; he takes responsibility for the mistakes of the 
      company but not its successes, attributing those to others 
      or to luck. He or she normally grows up within the com- 
      pany instead of being headhunted from outside. He or 
      she genuinely puts the company first, in other words, and 
      does not simply make use of it to further personal ends.    
Such a manager plays something of a Christ-like role 
      within the company, at least relative to the other members 
      of the business. This is a leader who takes the company’s 
      "sins" on himself and transforms them for the good of the 
      company ("redemption"). Sr Helen went on to explore the 
      concept of the "virtuous" manager, and the relationship 
      between ethics and success in a fallen world. From a 
      Catholic ethical perspective, it is important for both ends 
      and means to be virtuous. Is the product serving the common good? Is it being produced in a way that furthers the 
      common good?    
In the Catholic social tradition human beings are not 
      means to an end, but ends in themselves. They are 
      "persons", a term derived from Trinitarian theology which 
      speaks of God as one substance but three persons. Persons are not just individuals but constituted in part by their 
      relationships to others; persons working together in a 
      company do not create a machine but a community. The 
      "common good" is the nexus or fruit of these relationships 
      within a community. Thus the "Level 5" executive is the 
      one who is serving the common good of the company and 
    the wider community, Sr Helen concluded.
Arie de Geus, the former head of group planning for the 
      Royal Dutch/Shell Group and author of the bestseller The 
      Living Company, reported that a Shell survey had discov- 
      ered a total of 27 companies in the world that have sur- 
      vived for more than 150 years (in one case, for as many 
      as 700 years). All these companies that had stood the 
      test of time shared four characteristics. First, they were all 
      conservative in financing (they preferred money in the 
      pocket). Second, they were outward-looking, sensitive to 
      and engaged with the world around them. Third, they had 
      a sense of cohesion and company identity, with clear values, aims, and principles; and saw their organisation as a 
      "living community". Lastly, their leaders were "tolerant" – 
      delegating authority and leaving space for others to flourish, without losing control.    
Most existing companies are not like this, and survive for 
      decades, at best, rather than centuries. Research, in fact, 
      shows that the average lifespan of companies is in steep 
      decline, de Geus noted.
His conclusion was radical: business schools and conventional economics are killing companies by defining their 
      purpose as the "maximisation of shareholder value" – increasing the price of product that the market will stand in 
      relation to cost in terms of land, labour and capital. He 
      reinforced this by reference to research by Jim Collins 
      reported in another book, Built to Last, which showed that 
      companies which do not put profit at the top of their list of 
      priorities were actually 15 times more profitable over a 
      16-year period than companies which did. Profit, he concluded, should be regarded much like oxygen: as necessary for life, but not the reason for which we are living. 
      The second chapter of St Benedict’s Rule, quoting Matthew 6:33, agrees: "Strive first for the Kingdom of God 
      and his righteousness, and all these things will given to 
      you as well."
De Geus is not a Catholic, but he sees the Catholic 
      Church as a natural ally in his campaign for the revision of 
      company law. Since the nineteenth century shareholders 
      have had the power because they supply the capital. But 
      this is no longer a world of scarce capital, he said, and so 
      the maximisation of capital should no longer be the criterion of success. The more important criteria should be the 
      flourishing of the people in the business – their talent, loyalty, creativity and so on – as well as the quality of the 
      product. In the long run this reorientation of business to 
      People First PLC Ben Andradi and Stratford Caldecott 
      GK Chesterton Centre for Faith and Culture, Oxford 2 
      put "human capital" at the centre should ensure a more 
      sustainable economic system, he argued.
The third main speaker was the young chairman of Bren- 
      ninkmeijer Family Enterprises which owns the C&A textile 
      giant. Catholic social teaching, saidMaurice Brennink- 
      meijer, is "the only coherent, holistic, integrated frame- 
      work for viewing the quality of man’s relationships with his 
      world". It can be used to identify both how the world ought 
      to be and how to get there. The "servant-leader" model 
      helps others move up the pyramid: from a concern with 
      mere survival, to assuredness, communication, recognition/prestige and creativity – a pyramid roughly equivalent to Collins’s five levels.    
Brenninkmeijer had good advice of his own. The central 
      values in business should be Trust and Truth, he said. 
      While virtuous companies value profitability, they value 
      other things more. The goal of good leadership is to 
      "kindle the soft flame of wanting to be better"; to be virtu- 
      ous was to "act as though one loved". Faith was a source 
      of strength in learning to love. And he quoted former 
      President Harry S. Truman: "There is no limit to what you 
      can achieve provided you don’t mind who gets the credit." 
      This meeting of high-level business executives was im- 
      pressive in its radicalism. They saw business as a vocation and their leadership roles as a great calling. Far from 
      aligning with the conventional wisdom of the business 
      schools, they were attempting to bring the humanistic and 
      personalistic principles of their faith to bear on the way 
      they did business. They saw the need of these principles 
      more than ever in the current world of business, shaken 
      and unsure in the wake of the Enron and Parmalat scan- 
      dals. Fat-cat salaries, lack of integrity and trust in business had tarnished the image of business, and had led to 
      prestigious management journals asking themselves what 
      businesses are for. This is the time, in other words, for 
      Christians to provide some unique insights and leadership 
      in this area. We are already planning another conference 
      for next year.

BTopenworld is BT's new high growth, mass market Internet business focused increasingly on broadband services. BTopenworld is essentially an ISP, but with content that is designed to work with BTopenworld. The technology used by BT is ADSL. ADSL stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. It transforms the twisted copper pairs of wires between the local telephone exchange and your telephone socket into a high-speed digital line. It is called "asymmetric" because it moves data more quickly from the exchange to you than vice versa. This makes it ideal for applications where you would typically receive more data than you transmit such as the reception of digital audio-visual material. Compared to narrowband, broadband is up to10 times faster, always connected, offers varied portal content, home and business services, use of phone while surfing, unlimited usage at a flat fee, video rich content.streamingmedia.com: The next wave Internet is getting ready for launch. BTopenworld in the UK are in a unique position to facilitate for broadband, mobile computing and also to offer personalized services. What can we expect from this extraordinary portal?Ben Andradi: We will offer our customers compelling content and an easy to use intuitive portal delivered with high standards of customer service and technical quality. We will price, market and roll-out services aggressively. We are currently working with companies to offer the best in broadband content, and have more than 60 content deals in place, with a number of content providers covering everything from auctions to zoology. You will be able to buy cars, find jobs, play interactive games, watch movies and keep up with the latest national and international news. Content providers signed up so far include Blockbuster, Carlton On-Line, Rapido TV, Pearson Television, ITN, Cartoon Network and the Internet Movie Database. So for example, with a service such as the Internet Movie Database, the website you would look at with a modem is mainly text based, but on broadband the focus is geared much more to providing high quality streaming video, with crystal clear stereo sound.Q: New media content providers were obviously longing for the time after narrowband. You are concentrating on broadband specific content. What makes this more exciting than narrowband or TV content?A: The opportunities for delivering content on broadband are huge. The major advantage over narrowband is speed, with broadband delivering large files, such as audio and video clips is simple and fast. Live streaming of video also becomes viable with broadband. The current capabilities are just the tip of the iceberg, as the speed increases even more over time, the opportunities will become phenomenal.Q: How do BTopenworld attract big content providers?A: Content providers see broadband, our mobile Internet and our personal BTopenworld as a very powerful proposition. What they like is the ability to give us one load of content that comes out via a multiplicity of devices. The ability to approach a content provider and propose to distribute their content via the range of devices that we own is a very powerful proposition.Q: What's the timeframe in rolling out all these services? When do you reach ‘mainland' Europe and do you have any plans to enter the US market?A: At this time, we have rolled out to 500 exchanges covering approx. 35% of the UK. See http://www.bt.com/broadbandfor the latest details of the roll-out. We believe that the take-up of broadband, once people see how it completely transforms their on-line experience, will be very rapid. It is, however, a completely new service, so absolute numbers and market share, especially as this is also dependant on the marketing activities of our competitors, are impossible to estimate accurately BTopenworld will enter attractive second wave markets around the world deploying skills, platforms, content relationships and aggressive marketing to gain fast mover advantages.Q: Ben Andradi, thank you for the interview.
