About Our Abuse-Deterrent Technology

Elite’s proprietary abuse-deterrent technology, ART™, is a multi-particulate capsule which contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. When this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed. If the multi-particulate beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is designed to release. The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers. Elite’s pharmacological approach to abuse-deterrence can be applied to a wide range of opioids used today in pain management.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, as filed on June 15, 2016 with the SEC. We use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.  Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms "Elite", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" refer to Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsidiary.  Background  We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products.  We occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the "Northvale Facility"). The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") registered facility for research, development and manufacturing.  Strategy  We focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Application's ("ANDAs"); (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.  Our focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require new drug applications ("NDAs") under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the "Drug Price Competition Act") as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.  We believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.  Commercial Products  We own, license or contract manufacture the following products current being sold commercially:   Branded Product Therapeutic Launch Product Equivalent Category Date Phentermine HCl 37.5mg tablets Adipex-P� Bariatric April 2011 ("Phentermine 37.5mg") Lodrane D � Immediate Release capsules n/a OTC Allergy September 2011 ("Lodrane D") Methadone HCl 10mg tablets Dolophine� Pain January 2012 ("Methadone 10mg") Hydromorphone HCl 8mg tablets Dilaudid� Pain March 2012 ("Hydromorphone 8mg") Phendimetrazine Tartrate 35mg tablets Bontril� Bariatric November 2012 ("Phendimetrazine 35mg") Phentermine HCl 15mg and 30mg capsules Adipex-P� Bariatric April 2013 ("Phentermine 15mg" and "Phentermine 30mg") Naltrexone HCl 50mg tablets Revia� Pain September 2013 ("Naltrexone 50mg") Isradipine 2.5mg and 5mg capsules ("Isradipine 2.5mg" and "Isradipine n/a Cardiovascular January 2015 5mg") Hydroxyzine HCl 10mg, 25mg and 50mg tablets Atarax�, Vistaril� Antihistamine April 2015 ("Hydroxyzine 10mg" and "Hydroxyzine 25mg" and "Hydroxyzine 50mg") Oxycodone HCl Immediate Release 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg tablets ("OXY IR 5mg", "Oxy IR 10mg", "Oxy Roxycodone� Pain March 2016 IR 15mg", "OXY IR 20mg" and "Oxy IR 30mg")  Note: Phentermine 15mg and Phentermine 30mg are collectively and individually referred to as "Phentermine Capsules". Isradipine 2.5mg and Isradipine 5mg are collectively and individually referred to as "Isradipine Capsules". Hydroxyzine 10mg, Hydroxyzine 25mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg are collectively and individually referred to as "Hydroxyzine". Oxy IR 5mg, Oxy IR 10mg, Oxy IR 15mg Oxy IR 20mg and Oxy IR 30mg are collectively and individually referred to as "Oxy IR".  Phentermine 37.5mg  The approved ANDA for Phentermine 37.5mg was acquired pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Epic Pharma LLC ("Epic") dated September 10, 2010 (the "Phentermine Purchase Agreement").  Sales and marketing rights for Phentermine 37.5mg are included in the licensing agreement between the Company and Precision Dose Inc. ("Precision Dose") dated September 10, 2010 (the "Precision Dose License Agreement"). Please see the section below titled "Precision Dose License Agreement" for further details of this agreement.  The first shipment of Phentermine 37.5mg was made to Precision Dose's wholly owned subsidiary, TAGI Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("TAGI"), pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, with such initial shipment triggering a milestone payment under this agreement. Phentermine 37.5mg is currently being manufactured by Elite and distributed by TAGI under the Precision Dose License Agreement.  Lodrane D(R)  On September 27, 2011, the Company, along with ECR Pharmaceuticals ("ECR"), launched Lodrane D(R), an immediate release formulation of brompheniramine maleate and pseudoephedrine HCl, an effective, low-sedating antihistamine combined with a decongestant.  Lodrane D(R) is marketed under the Over-the-Counter Monograph (the "OTC Monograph") and accordingly, under the Code of Federal Regulations can be lawfully marketed in the US without prior approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). Within the past few years, the FDA has revised its enforcement policies, significantly limiting the circumstances under which these unapproved products may be marketed. If the FDA determines that a company is distributing an unapproved product that requires approval, the FDA may take enforcement action in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, product seizures and seeking a judicial injunction against distribution.  ECR products have since been divested so that Lodrane D(R) is promoted and distributed in the United States of America ("U.S.") now by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Lodrane D(R) is available over-the-counter but also has physician promotion. Lodrane D(R) is one of the only adult brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at this time.  There have been several mergers relating to ECR and successor entities and transfer of brand name ownership since this product was originally launched. Lodrane D(R) is accordingly currently promoted and distributed in the U.S. by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. ("Valeant"). Lodrane D(R) is available over-the-counter but also has physician promotion. Lodrane D(R) is the one of the only adult brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at this time.  Elite is manufacturing the product for Valeant and will receive manufacturing revenues for this product.  Methadone 10mg  Methadone 10mg is contract manufactured by Elite for Ascend Laboratories, LLC ("Ascend"), the owner of the approved ANDA.  On January 17, 2012, Elite commenced shipping Methadone 10mg tablets to Ascend pursuant to a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement dated June 23, 2011, as amended on September 24, 2012 and January 19, 2015, between Elite and Ascend (the "Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement"). Under the terms of the Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, Elite performs manufacturing and packaging of Methadone 10mg for Ascend.  Hydromorphone 8mg  The approved ANDA for Hydromorphone 8mg was acquired pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Mikah Pharma LLC ("Mikah Pharma") dated May 18, 2010 (the "Hydromorphone Purchase Agreement"). Transfer of the manufacturing process of Hydromorphone 8mg to the Northvale Facility, a prerequisite of the Company's commercial launch of the product, was approved by the FDA on January 23, 2012.  Sales and marketing rights for Hydromorphone 8mg are included in the Precision Dose License Agreement. Please see the section below titled "Precision Dose License Agreement" for further details of this agreement.  The first shipment of Hydromorphone 8mg was made to TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, in March 2012, with such initial shipment triggering a milestone payment under this agreement. Hydromorphone 8mg is currently being manufactured by Elite and distributed by TAGI under the Precision Dose License Agreement.  Phendimetrazine Tartrate 35mg  The ANDA for Phendimetrazine 35mg was acquired by Elite as part of the asset purchase agreement between the Company and Mikah Pharma, dated August 1, 2013 (the "Mikah ANDA Purchase"). Please see "Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications" below for more information on this agreement. The Northvale Facility was already an approved manufacturing site for this product as of the date of the Mikah ANDA Purchase. Prior to the acquisition of this ANDA, Elite had been manufacturing this product on a contract basis pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement with Mikah Pharma, dated June 1, 2011.  Phendimetrazine 35mg is currently a commercial product being manufactured by Elite and distributed by Epic Pharma LLC ("Epic") on a non-exclusive basis, and by Elite.  Phentermine 15mg and Phentermine 30mg  Phentermine 15mg capsules and Phentermine 30mg capsules were developed by the Company, with Elite receiving approval of the related ANDA in September 2012.  Sales and marketing rights for Phentermine 15mg and Phentermine 30mg are included in the Precision Dose License Agreement. Please see the section below titled "Precision Dose License Agreement" for further details of this agreement.  The first shipments of Phentermine 15mg and Phentermine 30mg were made to TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, in April 2013, with such initial shipments triggering a milestone payment under this agreement. Phentermine 15mg and Phentermine 30mg are currently being manufactured by Elite and distributed by TAGI under the Precision Dose License Agreement.  Naltrexone 50mg  The approved ANDA for Naltrexone 50mg was acquired by the Company pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between the Company and Mikah Pharma dated August 27, 2010 (the "Naltrexone Acquisition Agreement") for aggregate consideration of $200,000.

The first shipment of Hydroxyzine 10mg, Hydroxyzine 25mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg were made by Epic, pursuant to the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, in April 2015. Hydroxyzine 10mg, Hydroxyzine 25mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg are currently being manufactured and distributed by Epic under the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement.  Oxycodone 5mg, Oxycodone 10mg, Oxycodone 15mg, Oxycodone 20mg and Oxycodone 30mg  We received notification from Epic in October 2015 of the approval by the FDA of Epic's ANDA for Oxy IR. This product was an Identified IR Product in the Epic Strategic Alliance Agreement Dated March 18, 2009 (the "Epic Strategic Alliance"). Oxy IR was developed at the Northvale Facility pursuant to the Epic Strategic Alliance, in which we are entitled to a Product Fee of 15% of Profits as defined in the Epic Strategic Alliance.  Epic advised us that the first commercial sale of Oxy IR occurred in March 2016 and such sales are ongoing.  Filed products under FDA review  SequestOx(TM) - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone  SequestOx(TM) is our lead abuse-deterrent candidate for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. SequestOx(TM) is an immediate-release Oxycodone Hydrochloride containing sequestered Naltrexone which incorporates 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg doses of oxycodone into capsules.  In January 2016, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx(TM), after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, the Company received notification of the FDA's acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") of July 14, 2016.  On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx(TM) NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form.  On December 21, 2016, the Company met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that the Company could take to obtain approval of SequestOx(TM). Based on the FDA response, the Company believes that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. The Company believes that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOx(TM) formulation. The Company plans on proceeding immediately with the in vitro and in vivo studies required and expect to resubmit the SequestOx(TM) application later this year. The in vivo studies include bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation.  Please note, however, that there can be no assurances that the Company's intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if the Company receives marketing approval, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits relating to this product, or that any such future revenues and profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.  Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP CII (generic version of Percocet(R))  On August 9, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Percocet(R) (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen. Percocet(R) is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to severe pain.  Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII (generic version of Norco)  On December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Norco(R) (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII) 2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets. Norco is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. The combination products of hydrocodone and acetaminophen have total annual US sales of approximately $700 million, according to IMS Health Data.  There can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.  Approved Products Not Yet Commercialized  We currently own six different approved ANDAs, all of which were acquired as part of the Mikah ANDA Purchase. Each approved ANDA requires manufacturing site transfers as a prerequisite to commencement of commercial manufacturing and distribution. The products relating to each approved ANDA are included in the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, with Elite granting ANDA specific, exclusive or non-exclusive market rights (depending on the ANDA) to Epic. Commercial manufacturing of these products is expected to be transferred to either Epic or the Northvale Facility, with the required supplements to be filed with FDA in the manner and time frame that is economically beneficial to us.  Asset Acquisition Agreements  Generic Phentermine Capsules  On September 10, 2010, together with our wholly owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc., executed a purchase agreement (the "Phentermine Purchase Agreement") with Epic for the purpose of acquiring from Epic, an ANDA for a generic phentermine product (the "Phentermine ANDA"), with such being filed with the FDA at the time the Phentermine Purchase Agreement was executed. On February 4, 2011, the FDA approved the Phentermine ANDA. The acquisition of the Phentermine ANDA closed on March 31, 2011 and Elite paid the full acquisition price of $450,000 from the purchase agreement with Epic Pharma.  This product is being marketed and distributed by Precision Dose and its wholly owned subsidiary, TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, a description of which is set forth below.  Generic Hydromorphone HCl Product  On May 18, 2010, we executed an asset purchase agreement with Mikah Pharma (the "Hydromorphone Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Hydromorphone Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired from Mikah Pharma an approved ANDA for Hydromorphone 8 mg for aggregate consideration of $225,000, comprised of an initial payment of $150,000, which was made on May 18, 2010. A second payment of $75,000 was due to be paid to Mikah Pharma on June 15, 2010, with the Company having the option to make this payment in cash or by issuing to Mikah Pharma 937,500 shares of our common stock. We elected and did issue 937,500 shares of Common Stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, in full payment of the $75,000 due to Mikah Pharma pursuant to the Hydromorphone Purchase Agreement dated May 18, 2010.  This product is currently being marketed and distributed by Precision Dose and its wholly owned subsidiary, TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, a description of which is set forth below.  Generic Naltrexone Product  On August 27, 2010, we executed an asset purchase with Mikah Pharma (the "Naltrexone Acquisition Agreement"). Pursuant to the Naltrexone Acquisition Agreement, Elite acquired from Mikah Pharma the ANDA number 75-274 (Naltrexone Hydrochloride Tablets USP, 50 mg), and all amendments thereto, that have to date been filed with the FDA seeking authorization and approval to manufacture, package, ship and sell the products described in this ANDA within the United States and its territories (including Puerto Rico) for aggregate consideration of $200,000. In lieu of cash, Mikah Pharma agreed to accept product development services to be performed by us.  This product is being marketed and distributed by Precision Dose and its wholly owned subsidiary, TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, a description of which is set forth below.  Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications  On August 1, 2013, Elite executed the Mikah ANDA Purchase with Mikah Pharma and acquired a total of thirteen ANDAs, consisting of twelve ANDAs approved by the FDA and one ANDA under active review with the FDA, and all amendments thereto (the "Mikah Thirteen ANDA Acquisition") for aggregate consideration of $10,000,000, payable pursuant to a secured convertible note due in August 2016.  Each of the products referenced in the twelve approved ANDAs require manufacturing site approval with the FDA. We believe that the site transfers qualify for Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ("CBE 30") review, with one exception, which would allow for the product manufacturing transfer on an expedited basis. However, we can give no assurances that all will qualify for CBE 30 review, or on the timing of these transfers of manufacturing site, or on the approval by the FDA of the transfers of manufacturing site.  As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following products included in the Mikah Purchase Agreement have successfully achieved manufacturing site transfers:  � Phendimetrazine 35mg  � Isradipine 2.5mg and Isradipine 5mg  � Hydroxyzine 10mg, Hydroxyzine 25mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg  We have executed the Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License Agreement, relating to the manufacturing, marketing and sale of these twelve ANDAs. Please see below for further details on the Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License Agreement.  Licensing, Manufacturing and Development Agreements  Sales and Distribution Licensing Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC for SequestOx(TM)  On June 4, 2015, we executed an exclusive License Agreement (the "2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement") with Epic, to market and sell in the U.S., SequestOx(TM), an immediate release oxycodone with sequestered naltrexone capsule, owned by us. Epic will have the exclusive right to market ELI-200 and its various dosage forms as listed in Schedule A of the Agreement. Epic is responsible for all regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters related to the products. Pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement, Epic will pay us non-refundable payments totaling $15 million, with such amount representing the cost of an exclusive license to SequestOx(TM), the cost of developing the product, the filing of a NDA with the FDA and the receipt of the approval letter for the NDA from the FDA. As of the date of filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company has received $7.5 million of the $15 million in non-refundable payments due pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement, with such amount consisting of $5 million being due and owing on the execution date of the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement, and $2.5 million being earned as of January 14, 2016, the date of Elite's filing of an NDA with the FDA for the relevant product. Both of these non-refundable fees (i.e., the $5 million fee and the $2.5 million fee), have been paid by Epic.  The remaining $7.5 million in non-refundable payments due pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement is due on the FDA's approval of SequestOx(TM) for commercial sale in the United States of America (please see the paragraph below for further details). In addition, we will receive a license fee computed as a percentage (50%) of net sales of the products as defined in the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement and is entitled to multi-million-dollar minimum annual license fees we will manufacture the product for sale by Epic on a cost-plus basis and both parties agree to execute a separate Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. The license fee is payable quarterly for the term of the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement. The term of the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement is five years and may be extended for an additional five years upon mutual agreement of the parties. Elite can terminate the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement on 90 days' written notice in the event that Epic does not pay us certain minimum annual license fees over the initial five-year term of the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement. Either party may terminate this 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement upon a material breach and failure to cure that breach by the other party within a specified period. Please note that there was a change in management of Epic that occurred in May 2016, concurrent with a change in ownership of Epic. The new management of Epic has advised us of their desire to renegotiate the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement. While the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement is still in effect, as a prudent business practice, we are currently cooperating with Epic and are engaged in such negotiations with Epic, which are ongoing, as well as pursuing other options relating to the license and/or distribution of Sequest-Ox(TM). We believe that if agreement is reached with Epic on revised terms and conditions and amendment is made to the 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement, such amendment may materially differ from the current 2015 SequestOx(TM) License Agreement.  In addition, on July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx(TM) NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form. On December 21, 2016, the Company met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that the Company could take to obtain approval of SequestOx(TM). Based on the FDA response, the Company believes that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. The Company believes that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOx(TM) formulation. The Company plans on proceeding immediately with the in vitro and in vivo studies required and expect to resubmit the SequestOx(TM) . . .  Feb 09, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

OF OPERATIONS
						



THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

                                COMPARED TO THE

           THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)



  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 should be read in
conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our
discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as
a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk
Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
2016, as filed on June 15, 2016 with the SEC. We use words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "plan," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe,"
"intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions to identify
forward-looking statements.



Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms "Elite",
the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" refer to Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
subsidiary.



Background



We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development
and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how
and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products.



We occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow
Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the "Northvale Facility"). The
Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP")
and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") registered facility for
research, development and manufacturing.



Strategy



We focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain
management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical
products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Application's ("ANDAs"); (iii)
development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of
the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v)
commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of
royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development
of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other
pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures
and
other collaborations.



Our focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including
branded drug products which require new drug applications ("NDAs") under Section
505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration
Act of 1984 (the "Drug Price Competition Act") as well as generic drug products
which require ANDAs.



We believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a
diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in
various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish
licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us
to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.



Commercial Products



We own, license or contract manufacture the following products current being
sold commercially:

Phentermine 37.5mg



The approved ANDA for Phentermine 37.5mg was acquired pursuant to an asset
purchase agreement with Epic Pharma LLC ("Epic") dated September 10, 2010 (the
"Phentermine Purchase Agreement").




Sales and marketing rights for Phentermine 37.5mg are included in the licensing
agreement between the Company and Precision Dose Inc. ("Precision Dose") dated
September 10, 2010 (the "Precision Dose License Agreement"). Please see the
section below titled "Precision Dose License Agreement" for further details
of
this agreement.



The first shipment of Phentermine 37.5mg was made to Precision Dose's wholly
owned subsidiary, TAGI Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("TAGI"), pursuant to the Precision
Dose License Agreement, with such initial shipment triggering a milestone
payment under this agreement. Phentermine 37.5mg is currently being manufactured
by Elite and distributed by TAGI under the Precision Dose License Agreement.



Lodrane D



On September 27, 2011, the Company, along with ECR Pharmaceuticals ("ECR"),
launched Lodrane D, an immediate release formulation of brompheniramine maleate
and pseudoephedrine HCl, an effective, low-sedating antihistamine combined
with
a decongestant.



Lodrane D is marketed under the Over-the-Counter Monograph (the "OTC
Monograph") and accordingly, under the Code of Federal Regulations can be
lawfully marketed in the US without prior approval of the United States Food and
Drug Administration ("FDA"). Within the past few years, the FDA has revised its
enforcement policies, significantly limiting the circumstances under which these
unapproved products may be marketed. If the FDA determines that a company is
distributing an unapproved product that requires approval, the FDA may take
enforcement action in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, product
seizures and seeking a judicial injunction against distribution.




ECR products have since been divested so that Lodrane D is promoted and
distributed in the United States of America ("U.S.") now by Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Lodrane D is available over-the-counter but
also has physician promotion. Lodrane D is one of the only adult
brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at this time.
There have been several mergers relating to ECR and successor entities and
transfer of brand name ownership since this product was originally launched.
Lodrane D is accordingly currently promoted and distributed in the U.S. by
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. ("Valeant"). Lodrane D is available
over-the-counter but also has physician promotion. Lodrane D is the one of the
only adult brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at
this
time.



Elite is manufacturing the product for Valeant and will receive manufacturing
revenues for this product.

as defined in the Epic Strategic Alliance.




Epic advised us that the first commercial sale of Oxy IR occurred in March 2016
and such sales are ongoing.
Filed products under FDA review
SequestOx? - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone




SequestOx? is our lead abuse-deterrent candidate for the management of moderate
to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. SequestOx?
is an immediate-release Oxycodone Hydrochloride containing sequestered
Naltrexone which incorporates 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg doses of oxycodone
into capsules.



In January 2016, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for
SequestOx?, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the
FDA. In March 2016, the Company received notification of the FDA's acceptance of
this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA
with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") of
July
14, 2016.



On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding
the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx? NDA is complete
and the application is not ready for approval in its present form.



On December 21, 2016, the Company met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting
to discuss steps that the Company could take to obtain approval of SequestOx?.
Based on the FDA response, the Company believes that there is a clear path
forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. The Company believes that the
meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to
address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOx?
formulation. The Company plans on proceeding immediately with the in vitro and
in vivo studies required and expect to resubmit the SequestOx? application later
this year. The in vivo studies include bioequivalence and bioavailability fed
and fasted studies comparing the modified formulation to the original
formulation.



Please note, however, that there can be no assurances that the Company's
intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing will be accepted by or
receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if the Company
receives marketing approval, there can be no assurances of future revenues or
profits relating to this product, or that any such future revenues and profits
would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments
made to secure this marketing authorization.

Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP CII (generic version of Percocet)




On August 9, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version
of Percocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and
10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen. Percocet is a combination medication
and is used to help relieve moderate to severe pain.




Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII (generic version of
Norco)
On December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic
version of Norco (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII)
2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets. Norco is a
combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to moderately severe
pain. The combination products of hydrocodone and acetaminophen have total
annual US sales of approximately $700 million, according to IMS Health Data.



There can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing
authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all.
In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no
assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such
future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on
the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.
Approved Products Not Yet Commercialized




We currently own six different approved ANDAs, all of which were acquired as
part of the Mikah ANDA Purchase. Each approved ANDA requires manufacturing site
transfers as a prerequisite to commencement of commercial manufacturing and
distribution. The products relating to each approved ANDA are included in the
Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, with Elite granting ANDA specific,
exclusive or non-exclusive market rights (depending on the ANDA) to Epic.
Commercial manufacturing of these products is expected to be transferred to
either Epic or the Northvale Facility, with the required supplements to be filed
with FDA in the manner and time frame that is economically beneficial to us.



Asset Acquisition Agreements



Generic Phentermine Capsules



On September 10, 2010, together with our wholly owned subsidiary, Elite
Laboratories, Inc., executed a purchase agreement (the "Phentermine Purchase
Agreement") with Epic for the purpose of acquiring from Epic, an ANDA for a
generic phentermine product (the "Phentermine ANDA"), with such being filed with
the FDA at the time the Phentermine Purchase Agreement was executed. On February
4, 2011, the FDA approved the Phentermine ANDA. The acquisition of the
Phentermine ANDA closed on March 31, 2011 and Elite paid the full acquisition
price of $450,000 from the purchase agreement with Epic Pharma.




This product is being marketed and distributed by Precision Dose and its wholly
owned subsidiary, TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, a
description of which is set forth below.
Generic Hydromorphone HCl Product
On May 18, 2010, we executed an asset purchase agreement with Mikah Pharma (the
"Hydromorphone Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Hydromorphone Purchase
Agreement, the Company acquired from Mikah Pharma an approved ANDA for
Hydromorphone 8 mg for aggregate consideration of $225,000, comprised of an
initial payment of $150,000, which was made on May 18, 2010. A second payment of
$75,000 was due to be paid to Mikah Pharma on June 15, 2010, with the Company
having the option to make this payment in cash or by issuing to Mikah Pharma
937,500 shares of our common stock. We elected and did issue 937,500 shares of
Common Stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, in full payment of the
$75,000 due to Mikah Pharma pursuant to the Hydromorphone Purchase Agreement
dated May 18, 2010.



This product is currently being marketed and distributed by Precision Dose and
its wholly owned subsidiary, TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License
Agreement, a description of which is set forth below.



Generic Naltrexone Product



On August 27, 2010, we executed an asset purchase with Mikah Pharma (the
"Naltrexone Acquisition Agreement"). Pursuant to the Naltrexone Acquisition
Agreement, Elite acquired from Mikah Pharma the ANDA number 75-274 (Naltrexone
Hydrochloride Tablets USP, 50 mg), and all amendments thereto, that have to date
been filed with the FDA seeking authorization and approval to manufacture,
package, ship and sell the products described in this ANDA within the United
States and its territories (including Puerto Rico) for aggregate consideration
of $200,000. In lieu of cash, Mikah Pharma agreed to accept product development
services to be performed by us.

This product is being marketed and distributed by Precision Dose and its wholly
owned subsidiary, TAGI, pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, a
description of which is set forth below.
Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications
On August 1, 2013, Elite executed the Mikah ANDA Purchase with Mikah Pharma and
acquired a total of thirteen ANDAs, consisting of twelve ANDAs approved by the
FDA and one ANDA under active review with the FDA, and all amendments thereto
(the "Mikah Thirteen ANDA Acquisition") for aggregate consideration of
$10,000,000, payable pursuant to a secured convertible note due in August 2016.



Each of the products referenced in the twelve approved ANDAs require
manufacturing site approval with the FDA. We believe that the site transfers
qualify for Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ("CBE 30") review, with one
exception, which would allow for the product manufacturing transfer on an
expedited basis. However, we can give no assurances that all will qualify for
CBE 30 review, or on the timing of these transfers of manufacturing site, or on
the approval by the FDA of the transfers of manufacturing site.



 As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following
products included in the Mikah Purchase Agreement have successfully achieved
manufacturing site transfers:



   Phendimetrazine 35mg




   Isradipine 2.5mg and Isradipine 5mg




   Hydroxyzine 10mg, Hydroxyzine 25mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg




We have executed the Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License Agreement, relating
to the manufacturing, marketing and sale of these twelve ANDAs. Please see below
for further details on the Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License Agreement.
Licensing, Manufacturing and Development Agreements
Sales and Distribution Licensing Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC for SequestOx?




On June 4, 2015, we executed an exclusive License Agreement (the "2015
SequestOx? License Agreement") with Epic, to market and sell in the U.S.,
SequestOx?, an immediate release oxycodone with sequestered naltrexone capsule,
owned by us. Epic will have the exclusive right to market ELI-200 and its
various dosage forms as listed in Schedule A of the Agreement. Epic is
responsible for all regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters related to the
products. Pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement, Epic will pay us
non-refundable payments totaling $15 million, with such amount representing the
cost of an exclusive license to SequestOx?, the cost of developing the product,
the filing of a NDA with the FDA and the receipt of the approval letter for the
NDA from the FDA. As of the date of filing of this quarterly report on Form
10-Q, the Company has received $7.5 million of the $15 million in non-refundable
payments due pursuant to the 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement, with such amount
consisting of $5 million being due and owing on the execution date of the 2015
SequestOx? License Agreement, and $2.5 million being earned as of January 14,
2016, the date of Elite's filing of an NDA with the FDA for the relevant
product. Both of these non-refundable fees (i.e., the $5 million fee and the
$2.5 million fee), have been paid by Epic.




The remaining $7.5 million in non-refundable payments due pursuant to the 2015
SequestOx? License Agreement is due on the FDA's approval of SequestOx?
  for

commercial sale in the United States of America (please see the paragraph below
for further details). In addition, we will receive a license fee computed as a
percentage (50%) of net sales of the products as defined in the 2015 SequestOx?
License Agreement and is entitled to multi-million-dollar minimum annual license
fees we will manufacture the product for sale by Epic on a cost-plus basis and
both parties agree to execute a separate Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. The
license fee is payable quarterly for the term of the 2015 SequestOx? License
Agreement. The term of the 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement is five years and
may be extended for an additional five years upon mutual agreement of the
parties. Elite can terminate the 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement on 90 days'
written notice in the event that Epic does not pay us certain minimum annual
license fees over the initial five-year term of the 2015 SequestOx? License
Agreement. Either party may terminate this 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement
upon a material breach and failure to cure that breach by the other party within
a specified period. Please note that there was a change in management of Epic
that occurred in May 2016, concurrent with a change in ownership of Epic. The
new management of Epic has advised us of their desire to renegotiate the 2015
SequestOx? License Agreement. While the 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement is
still in effect, as a prudent business practice, we are currently cooperating
with Epic and are engaged in such negotiations with Epic, which are ongoing, as
well as pursuing other options relating to the license and/or distribution of
Sequest-Ox?. We believe that if agreement is reached with Epic on revised terms
and conditions and amendment is made to the 2015 SequestOx? License Agreement,
such amendment may materially differ from the current 2015 SequestOx? License
Agreement.

In addition, on July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or
CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx?
NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present
form. On December 21, 2016, the Company met with the FDA for an end-of-review
meeting to discuss steps that the Company could take to obtain approval of
SequestOx?. Based on the FDA response, the Company believes that there is a
clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. The Company believes
that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a
plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the
SequestOx? formulation. The Company plans on proceeding immediately with the in
vitro and in vivo studies required and expect to resubmit the SequestOx?
application later this year. The in vivo studies include bioequivalence and
bioavailability fed and fasted studies comparing the modified formulation to the
original formulation.



There can be no assurances that the Company's intended future resubmission of
the NDA product filing will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from
the FDA. In addition, even if the Company receives marketing approval, there can
be no assurances of future revenues or profits relating to this product, or that
any such future revenues and profits would be in amounts that provide adequate
return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing
authorization.




Manufacturing and License Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC




On October 2, 2013, we executed the Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License
Agreement (the "Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement"). This agreement
granted Epic certain rights to manufacture, market and sell in the United States
and Puerto Rico the twelve approved ANDAs acquired by us pursuant to the Mikah
Thirteen ANDA Acquisition. Of the twelve approved ANDAs, Epic will have the
exclusive right to market six products as listed in Schedule A of the Epic
Manufacturing and License Agreement, and a non-exclusive right to market six
products as listed in Schedule D of the Epic Manufacturing and License
Agreement. Epic will manufacture the products and is responsible for all
regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters related to the products and for all
costs related to the site transfer for all products. We have no further
obligations or deliverables under the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement.
Pursuant to the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, we will receive a
license fee and milestone payments. The license fee will be computed as a
percentage of the gross profit, as defined in the Epic Manufacturing and License
Agreement, earned by Epic a result of sales of the products. The manufacturing
cost used for the calculation of the license fee is a predetermined amount per
unit plus the cost of the drug substance (API) and the sales cost for the
calculation is predetermined based on net sales.



If we manufacture any product for sale by Epic, then Epic shall pay us the same
predetermined manufacturing cost per unit plus the cost of the API. The license
fee is payable monthly for the term of the Epic Manufacturing and License
Agreement. Epic shall pay to us certain milestone payments as defined by the
Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement. The term of the Epic Manufacturing and
License Agreement is five years and may be extended for an additional five years
upon mutual agreement of the parties. Twelve months following the launch of a
product covered by the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, we may
terminate the marketing rights for any product if the license fee paid, by Epic,
falls below a designated amount for a six-month period of that product. We may
also terminate the exclusive marketing rights if Epic is unable to meet the
annual unit volume forecast for a designated product group for any year, subject
to the ability of Epic, during the succeeding six-month period, to achieve at
least one-half of the prior year's minimum annual unit forecast. The Epic
Manufacturing and License Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement, as a
result of a breach by either party that is not cured within 60 days' notice of
the breach, or by us as a result of Epic Pharma becoming a party to a
bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding that continues for a
period of 30 days or more.




Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
On June 23, 2011 and as amended on September 24, 2012 and January 19, 2015, we
entered into an agreement to manufacture and supply Methadone 10mg to
ThePharmaNetwork LLC (the "Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement").
ThePharmaNetworkLLC was subsequently acquired by Alkem Laboratories Ltd
("Alkem") and now goes by the name Ascend Laboratories LLC ("Ascend") and is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Alkem.



Ascend in the owner of the approved ANDA for Methadone 10mg, and the Northvale
Facility is an approved manufacturing site for this ANDA. The Methadone
Manufacturing and Supply Agreement provides for the manufacture and packaging by
the Company of Ascend's methadone hydrochloride 10mg tablets.




The initial shipment of Methadone 10mg pursuant to the Methadone Manufacturing
and Supply Agreement occurred in January 2012.
On August 26, 2016, the Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement was amended
and extended through December 31, 2017.

Precision Dose License Agreement
On September 10, 2010, we executed a License Agreement with Precision Dose (the
"Precision Dose License Agreement") to market and distribute Phentermine 37.5mg,
Phentermine 15mg, Phentermine 30mg, Hydromorphone 8mg, Naltrexone 50mg, and
certain additional products that require approval from the FDA, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, TAGI, in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada.
Phentermine 37.5mg was launched in April 2011. Hydromorphone 8mg was launched in
March 2012. Phentermine 15mg and Phentermine 30mg were launched in April 2013.
Naltrexone 50mg was launched in September 2013. Precision Dose will have the
exclusive right to market these products in the United States and Puerto Rico
and a non-exclusive right to market the products in Canada.



Pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, Elite will receive a license
fee and milestone payments. The license fee will be computed as a percentage of
the gross profit, as defined in the Precision Dose License Agreement, earned by
Precision Dose as a result of sales of the products. The license fee is payable
monthly for the term of the Precision Dose License Agreement. The milestone
payments will be paid in six installments. The first installment was paid upon
execution of the Precision Dose License Agreement. The remaining installments
are to be paid upon FDA approval and initial shipment of the products to
Precision Dose. The term of the Precision Dose License Agreement is 15 years and
may be extended for 3 successive terms, each of 5 years.




Development Agreement with Akorn Pharmaceuticals




On January 10, 2011, we entered into an agreement for us to develop an
intermediate product for a generic version of a prescription product for Hi-Tech
Pharmacal Co, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Akorn Pharmaceuticals) ("Akorn").
Under the terms of the agreement, we will undertake a development program for an
intermediate product that Akorn shall then incorporate into a final product.
Akorn or its designees, shall be responsible for the filing of the ANDA for the
finished product and the ANDA will be filed under the Akorn name. Upon approval
of the ANDA, Elite will manufacture the intermediate product. Akorn will
manufacture the final product and will be responsible for the marketing and
sales of the final product. Akorn will pay us milestone payments for the
development work. Upon commercialization, we will receive payment for the
manufacturing of the intermediate product and a percentage of the profits
generated from the sale of the product.



Please note that there is currently no development activity being conducted
pursuant to this agreement and there was no activity during the prior fiscal
year as well. There can be no assurances that development activities will resume
or that a resumption of development activities will result in the successful
development of the relevant product. Furthermore, there can be no assurances
that the development program will result in an intermediate product that can be
incorporated into a final product. There can be no assurances that an ANDA will
be filed by Akorn or its designees or that any such ANDA filed will receive
marketing approval by the FDA. Furthermore, there can be no assurances of the
commercialization of a final product containing the intermediate relating to
this agreement or that such commercialization will result in profits being
generated from the sale of the product.




Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC




On August 24, 2016, we entered into an agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC
("SunGen") (the "SunGen Agreement") to undertake and engage in the research,
development, sales and marketing of four generic pharmaceutical products. Two of
the products are classified as CNS stimulants (the "CNS Products") and two of
the products are classified as beta blockers (the "Beta Blocker Products").



Under the terms of the SunGen Agreement, Elite and SunGen will share in the
responsibilities and costs in the development of these products and will share
in the profits from sales. Upon approval, the know-how and intellectual property
rights to the products will be owned jointly by Elite and SunGen. SunGen shall
have the exclusive right to market and sell the Beta Blocker Products using
SunGen's label and Elite shall have the exclusive right to market and sell the
CNS Products using Elite's label. Elite will manufacture and package all four
products on a cost plus basis.



Products Under Development



Elite's research and development activities are primarily focused on developing
its proprietary abuse deterrent technology and the development of a range of
abuse deterrent opioid products that utilize this technology or other approaches
to abuse deterrence.



Elite's proprietary abuse-deterrent technology, utilizes the pharmacological
approach to abuse deterrence and consists of a multi-particulate capsule which
contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used
primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. When
this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through
the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing
therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed. If the multi-particulate
beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is designed
to release. The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria
by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist
and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug
abusers.



  8






We filed an NDA for the first product to utilize our abuse deterrent technology,
Immediate Release Oxycodone 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg with sequestered
Naltrexone (collectively and individually referred to as "SequestOx?"), on
January 14, 2016. On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter,
or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the
SequestOx? NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its
present form. On December 21, 2016, the Company met with the FDA for an
end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that the Company can take to obtain
approval of SequestOx?. Based on the FDA response, the Company believes there is
a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. The meeting
minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address
the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOx? formulation.
The Company plans on proceeding immediately with the in vitro and in vivo
studies required and expects to resubmit the SequestOx? application later this
year. The in vivo studies include bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and
fasted studies comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation.
Please note that there can be no assurances of the Company receiving marketing
authorization for SequestOx?, and accordingly, there can be no assurances that
the Company will earn and receive the additional $7.5 million or future license
fees. If the Company does not receive these payments or fees, it will materially
and adversely affect our financial condition.



On August 9, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version
of Percocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and
10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen ("Generic Oxy/APAP"). Percocet is a
combination medication, with abuse deterrence, and is used to help relieve
moderate to severe pain. Please note that there can be no assurances of this
product receiving marketing authorization, or achieving commercialization. In
addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is
commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such
amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made
to secure marketing authorization for this product.



On December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic
version of Norco (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII)
2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets ("Generic
Hydrocodone/APAP"). Norco is a combination medication and is used to help
relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. Please note that there can be no
assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization, or achieving
commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and
the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or
profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant
investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product.



The Company believes that the abuse deterrent technology can be applied to and
incorporated into a wide range of opioids used today for pain management and
has, to date, identified 10 additional products for potential development. All
of these products are at early stages of development, with research and
development activities mainly consisting of in-house process development and
laboratory studies. Extensive efficacy and safety studies, similar to those
conducted for SequestOx?, Generic Oxy/APAP and Generic Hydrocodone/APAP, have
not yet been conducted for these other products. As a result, costs incurred in
relation to the development of these 10 products have not been material.



Research and development costs were $1.5 million and $3.2 million for the three
months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $4.3 million and $10.0
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Costs incurred during the prior fiscal year relate almost entirely to the
development of the abuse deterrent opioid product, SequestOx?, and costs
incurred during the current fiscal year relate almost entirely to the
development of the abuse deterrent opioid products, SequestOx?, Generic Oxy/APAP
and Generic Hydrocodone/APAP.



On June 4, 2015, the Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing
agreement which included a non-refundable payment of $5 million to Elite for
prior research and development activities, with such representing the first
material net cash inflows being generated by ELI-200. On January 14, 2016, the
Company filed an NDA with the FDA for SequestOx?, thereby earning a
non-refundable $2.5 million milestone. An additional $7.5 million non-refundable
milestone is due upon the FDA's approval of Elite's NDA. Please note, as further
detailed above, there can be no assurances of the Company receiving marketing
authorization for SequestOx?, and accordingly, there can be no assurances that
the Company will earn and receive the additional $7.5 million or future license
fees. The non-receipt by the Company of these payments and or fees may
materially and adversely affect our financial condition.



Please note that, while the FDA is required to review applications within
certain timeframes, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that
additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent
submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until
an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurances that the information
requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify
approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject
to FDA regulation. Based on the foregoing, it is impossible to anticipate the
amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product.
In addition, there can be no assurances of the Company filing the required
application(s) with the FDA or of the FDA approving such application(s) if
filed, and the Company's ability to successfully develop and commercialize
products incorporating its abuse deterrent technology is subject to a high level
of risk as detailed in "Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business" of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 15, 2016, and further
detailed in "Item 1A-Risk Factors" in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.




Abuse-Deterrent and Sustained Release Opioids




The abuse-deterrent opioid products utilize our patented abuse-deterrent
technology that is based on a pharmacological approach. These products are
combinations of a narcotic agonist formulation intended for use in patients with
pain, and an antagonist, formulated to deter abuse of the drug.  Both, agonist
and antagonist, have been on the market for a number of years and sold
separately in various dose strengths. We have filed INDs for two abuse resistant
products under development and has tested products in various pharmacokinetic
studies. We expect to continue to develop multiple abuse resistant products.
Products utilizing the pharmacological approach to deter abuse such as
Suboxone, a product marketed in the United States by Reckitt Benckiser
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Embeda, a product marketed in the United States by
Pfizer, Inc., have been approved by the FDA and are being marketed in the United
States.



  9






We have developed, and retain the rights to these abuse resistant and sustained
release opioid products. We may license these products at a later date to a
third party who could provide funding for the remaining clinical studies and who
could provide sales and distribution for the product.



We also developed controlled release technology for oxycodone under a joint
venture with Elan which terminated in 2002. According to the Elan Termination
Agreement, we acquired all proprietary, development and commercial rights for
the worldwide markets for the products developed by the joint venture, including
the sustained release opioid products. Upon licensing or commercialization of an
oral controlled release formulation of oxycodone for the treatment of pain, we
will pay a royalty to Elan pursuant to the Elan Termination Agreement. If we
were to sell the product itself, we will pay a 1% royalty to Elan based on the
product's net sales, and if we enter into an agreement with another party to
sell the product, we will pay a 9% royalty to Elan based on our net revenues
from this product. We are allowed to recoup all development costs including
research, process development, analytical development, clinical development and
regulatory costs before payment of any royalties to Elan.



Patents



Since our incorporation, we have secured the following patents, of which two
have been assigned for a fee to another pharmaceutical company. Our patents are:




PATENT                                                    EXPIRATION DATE

U.S. patent 5,837,284 (assigned to Celgene Corporation)   November 2018

Canadian patent 2,541,371                                 September 2024
U.S. patent 9,056,054                                     June 2030




We also have pending applications for two additional U.S. patents and three
foreign patents. We intend to apply for patents for other products in the
future; however, there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications
or other applications which we may file will be granted. We have also filed
corresponding foreign applications for key patents.




Prior to the enactment in the United States of new laws adopting certain changes
mandated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ("GATT"), the exclusive
rights afforded by a U.S. Patent were for a period of 17 years measured from the
date of grant. Under GATT, the term of any U.S. Patent granted on an application
filed subsequent to June 8, 1995 terminates 20 years from the date on which the
patent application was filed in the United States or the first priority date,
whichever occurs first. Future patents granted on an application filed before
June 8, 1995, will have a term that terminates 20 years from such date, or 17
years from the date of grant, whichever date is later.



Under the Drug Price Competition Act, a U.S. product patent or use patent may be
extended for up to five years under certain circumstances to compensate the
patent holder for the time required for FDA regulatory review of the product.
Such benefits under the Drug Price Competition Act are available only to the
first approved use of the active ingredient in the drug product and may be
applied only to one patent per drug product. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to take advantage of this law.



Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and
patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection
against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance,
therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an
invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents
covering the same invention, or that any judicial interpretation of the
validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one
country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding
patent issued in another country. Furthermore, even if our patents are
determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no
assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and
compete with us using the resulting alternative technology.



Trademarks



SequestOx? is a trademark owned by Elite, which received a Notice of Allowance
by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on December 22, 2015.



  10






We currently plan to license at least some of our products to other entities in
the marketing of pharmaceuticals, but may also sell products under our own brand
name in which case we may register trademarks for those products.




Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Manufacturing




A significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign
sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business
abroad, including:



   ?  greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication
      problems;




  ? the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies;




   ?  interim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment
      shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or
      fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and




   ?  uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the
      enforcement of contracts and other rights.




While we currently obtain the raw materials that we need from over 20 suppliers,
some materials used in our products are currently available from only one
supplier or a limited number of suppliers. The FDA requires identification of
raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw
materials were unavailable from a specified supplier, FDA approval of a new
supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved.




We have acquired pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment for manufacturing our
products. We have registered our facilities with the FDA and the DEA.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers




Each year we have had one or a few customers that have accounted for a large
percentage of our limited revenues, therefore the termination or restructuring
of a contract with a customer may result in the loss of material amount or
substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new
relationships with existing or new customers, but despite these efforts we may
not, at the time that any of our current contracts expire, have other contracts
in place generating similar or material revenue. We have agreements with Epic,
Precision Dose and Ascend for the licensing, sales and distribution of products
that we manufacture. We are currently renegotiating a licensing contract with
Epic, which may result in the termination of an existing contract or an amended
licensing contract that is materially different from that already in place. We
receive revenues to manufacture these products and also receive a profit split
or royalties based on in-market sales of the products.




Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with GAAP, and our discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and operating results require our management to make
judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 -
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the
preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates
and such differences may be material.



Results of Operations



The following set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The
period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative
of future results.



Three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015
Revenue, Cost of revenue and Gross profit:

                                           For the Three Months Ended December 31,                  Change
                                               2016                      2015              Dollars        Percentage
Manufacturing fees                      $         1,885,765       $         1,622,052     $  263,713               16 %
Licensing fees                                      444,884                   571,824       (126,940 )            -22 %
Total revenue                                     2,330,649                 2,193,876        136,773                6 %
Cost of revenue                                   1,726,751                   835,675        891,076              107 %
Gross profit                            $           603,898       $         1,358,201     $ (754,303 )            -56 %

Gross profit - percentage                                26 %                      62 %




Total revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 increased by
$0.1 million or 6%, to $2.3, as compared to $2.2 million, for the corresponding
period in 2015 due to the timing of generic product shipments.




Manufacturing fees increased by $0.3 million, or 16%, due to timing of generic
product shipments.




Licensing fees decreased by $0.1 million, or 22%. This decrease is primarily due
to the timing of in-market sales of the Company's generic products, as well as
margins achieved by the Company's licensed marketing partners. License fees
earned are based on in-market sales and accordingly, there is a natural lag
between manufacturing revenues earned by the Company and related license fees
being earned from in market sales occurring subsequent to the Company's shipment
of licensed generic products to its marketing partners. In market profits
achieved by the Company's marketing partners are also a factor, with a direct
correlation to the license fee revenues earned by the Company.



Costs of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of
revenue increased by $0.9 million or 107%, to $1.7 million as compared to $0.8
million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in costs of revenue
is primarily due to increased and continued investments in Company's facility
and resources leading to higher overhead absorption rates.



Our gross profit margin was 26% during the three months ended December 31, 2016
as compared to 62% during the three months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease
in gross margin is due to the product mix of generics manufactured during the
quarter, combined with higher overhead absorption rates.

Operating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and
administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization
expenses. Operating expenses for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016
decreased by $1.8 million, or 43%, to $2.3 million, as compared to $4.1 million
for the corresponding period in 2015.



Research and development costs for the three months ended December 31, 2016 were
$1.5 million, a decrease of $1.7 million or 52% from $3.2 million of such costs
for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was due to the timing
and composition of ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other
products.



General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016
and 2015 was $0.7 million. The Company has continued to increase the utilization
of the Company's manufacturing facilities resulting in lower unallocated
overheads.



Non-cash compensation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and
2015 was $0.08 million. Non-cash compensation expense derives from the timing in
amortization of the value of employee stock options issued over the course
of
the last three years.



Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended December 31,
2016 was $0.02 million, a decrease of $0.18 million, or 87% from $0.2 million of
such costs for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was due to
the combination of increased facility utilization and higher depreciation
absorption rates currently as a result of facility expansion and improvements
over the last year.



As a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the three months
ended December 31, 2016 was $1.7 million, compared to a loss from operations of
$2.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was net
other income of $1.5 million, an increase in net other income of $11.0 million
from the net other (expense) of $(9.5) million for the comparable period of the
prior year. The increase in other income was due to derivative income relating
to changes in the fair value of our outstanding warrants during the quarter
ended December 31, 2016 totaling other income of $1.6 million, as compared to
other (expense) of $(9.5) million for the comparable period of the prior year.
Please note that derivative income (expenses) is determined in large part by the
number of warrants outstanding and the change in the closing price of the
Company's Common Stock as of the end of the period, as compared to the closing
price at the beginning of the period, with a strong inverse relationship between
derivative revenues and increases in the closing price of the Company's Common
Stock.

Pharmacy Choice - Pharmaceutical News - ELITE PHARMACEUTICALS INC /NV/ - 10-K - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION - July 22, 2017
Pharmacy News Article






							 6/14/17 - ELITE PHARMACEUTICALS INC /NV/ - 10-K - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION
						



Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, or MD&A, is intended to provide a reader of our consolidated
financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on
our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other
factors that may affect our future results. You should read the following
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial
data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained
in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report,
including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business,
includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You
should review Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the
following discussion and analysis.



Background



We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development
and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how
and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products.



We occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow
Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ. The Northvale Facility operates
under Current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") and is a United States Drug
Enforcement Agency ("DEA") registered facility for research, development, and
manufacturing.



Strategy



We focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain
management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical
products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Application's ("ANDAs"); (iii)
development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of
the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v)
commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of
royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development
of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other
pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures
and
other collaborations.



Our focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including
branded drug products which require new drug applications ("NDAs") under Section
505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration
Act of 1984 (the "Drug Price Competition Act") as well as generic drug products
which require ANDAs.



  57






We believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a
diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in
various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish
licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us
to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.




Product Development Activities




In January 2016, we submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx?,
after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March
2016, we received notification of the FDA's acceptance of this filing and that
such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action
under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") of July 14, 2016. On July 15,
2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The
CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx? NDA is complete and the
application is not ready for approval in its present form. On December 21, 2016,
we met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that we could
take to obtain approval of SequestOx?. Based on the FDA response, we believe
that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. We
believe that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017,
supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying
the SequestOx? formulation. Such plan includes, without limitation, conducting
bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies, comparing the
modified formulation to the original formulation. The fed study is in progress.
The Company plans on initiating the fasted study after successful completion of
the fed study. Resubmission of the SequestOx? application requires successful
completion of all required studies, including these fed and fasted studies.
Please note, however, that there can be no assurances that our intended future
resubmission of the NDA product filing will be accepted by or receive marketing
approval from the FDA. In addition, even if we receive marketing approval, there
can be no assurances of future revenues or profits relating to this product, or
that any such future revenues and profits would be in amounts that provide
adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing
authorization.



On August 9, 2016, we filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of
Percocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and
10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen. Percocet is a combination medication
and is used to help relieve moderate to severe pain. The Company has not
received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.



On December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic
version of Norco (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII)
2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets. Norco is a
combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to moderately severe
pain. The combination products of hydrocodone and acetaminophen have total
annual US sales of approximately $700 million, according to IMS Health Data. The
Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.



There can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing
authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all.
In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no
assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such
future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on
the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.



On March 22, 2017, European Patent No. 1615623 titled "Abuse-Resistant Oral
Dosage Forms and Method of Use Thereof" was issued. This patent expands the
intellectual property for the Company's opioid abuse deterrent technology. Elite
now has four US patents, one European patent, and two Canadian patents issued in
this area with additional patents pending in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Results of Operations:



Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016
Revenue, Cost of revenue and Gross profit:



                               Years Ended March 31,                    Change
                               2017             2016           Dollars         Percentage
Manufacturing fees          $ 7,326,959     $  8,002,866     $   (675,907 )             -8 %
Licensing fees                2,310,756        4,495,466       (2,184,710 )            -49 %
Total revenue                 9,637,715       12,498,332       (2,860,617 )            -23 %
Cost of revenue               5,898,405        4,484,162        1,414,243               32 %
Gross profit                $ 3,739,310     $  8,014,170     $ (4,274,860 )            -53 %

Gross profit - percentage            39 %             64 %




Total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $2.9 million or
23%, to $9.6 million, as compared to $12.5 million, for the corresponding year.




Manufacturing fees decreased by $0.7 million, or 8%, due to decrease in generic
Methadone, Hydromorphone and Phentermine sales, partially offset by increases in
generic Naltrexone sales.



Licensing fees decreased by $2.2 million, or 49%. This decrease is primarily due
to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in
January 2016 related to the filing of a New Drug Application for SequestOx?.
This milestone payment was offset by increases in license fees from generic
sales licensed to TAGI and Epic.



Costs of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of
revenue increased by $1.4 million or 32%, to $5.9 million as compared to $4.5
million for the corresponding period. The increase in costs of revenue is
primarily due to increased and continued investments in Company's facility and
resources, and increased regulatory costs, leading to higher overhead absorption
rates.



Our gross profit margin was 39% during the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared
to 64% during the year ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin is due
to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in
January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOx?, which resulted in a
greater gross profit margin in the prior year, as compared to the current year,
combined with a product mix consisting of lower margin products and higher
overhead absorption rates in the current year, as compared to the prior year.



Operating expenses:



                                            Years Ended March 31,                    Change

Total operating expenses                $ 11,095,243     $ 16,330,970     $
(5,235,727 )            -32 %




Operating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and
administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization
expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $5.2
million, or 32%, to $11.1 million, as compared to $16.3 million for the prior
year.



Research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $8.3
million, a decrease of $4.1 million or 33% from $12.4 million of such costs for
the prior year. The decrease was due to the timing and composition of ongoing
development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products in addition to a
focus on clinical trials for generic products.



General and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $2.1
million, a decrease of $0.8 million or 28% from $2.9 million of such costs for
the prior year. The decrease was due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives
focused on an actual and proportionate reduction of general and administrative
expenses, as compared to commercial and product development activities and
achieving an operating expense profile with an increased direct correlation to
these commercial and product development activities.



  59






Non-cash compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.36
million, an increase of $0.03 million or 7% from $0.33 million of such costs for
the prior year. Non-cash compensation expense derives from the timing in
amortization of the value of employee stock options issued over the course
of
the last three years.



Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.4
million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 47% from $0.7 million of such costs for
the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was due to the combination
of increased facility utilization and higher depreciation absorption rates
currently as a result of facility expansion and improvements over the last year.



As a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March
31, 2017 was $7.4 million, compared to a loss from operations of $8.3 million
for the year ended March 31, 2016.

Other income (expense), net for the year ended March 31, 2017 was net other
income of $9.3 million, an increase in net other income of $2.2 million from the
net other income of $7.1 million for the comparable period of the prior year.
The increase in other income was due to the change in the fair value of our
outstanding warrants (derivative instruments) during the year ended March 31,
2017 totaling other income of $9.5 million, as compared to $7.4 million for the
prior year. Please note that the change in fair value of derivative instruments
is determined in large part by the number of warrants outstanding and the change
in the closing price of our Common Stock as of the end of the year, as compared
to the closing price at the beginning of the year, with a strong inverse
relationship between derivative revenues and increases in the closing price
of
our Common Stock.



As a result of the foregoing, our net income from operations before the net
benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits for the year ended March
31, 2017 was $1.9 million, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the prior
year.



Net benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits

the prior year. Accordingly, net income attributable to common shareholders for
the year ended March 31, 2017 was a net income of $24.5 million, compared to a
net loss of $10.0 million for the prior year.

Total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased by $7.5 million, or
149%, to $12.5 million, as compared to $5.0 million, for the corresponding year
due to continued growth in the Company's generic product lines.




Manufacturing fees increased by $4.1 million, or 107%, due to continued growth
in the Company's generic product sales.
Licensing fees increased by $3.4 million, or 294%. This increase is due to the
Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January
2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOx? in addition to increased
profit splits from product sales relating to TAGI and Epic.



Costs of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of
revenue increased by $1.5 million or 49%, to $4.5 million, as compared to $3.0
million for the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is due to the increase
in manufacturing volumes.



Our gross profit margin was 64% during the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared
to 40% during the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is due in large part
to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in
January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOx?.

Operating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and
administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization
expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased by $2.2
million, or 12%, to $16.3 million, as compared to $18.5 million for the year
ended March 31, 2015.



Research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2016 were $12.4
million, a decrease of $2.3 million or 16% from $14.7 million of such costs for
the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was due to the timing and
composition of ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other
products.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015
were $2.9 million. We have continued to increase the utilization of our
manufacturing facilities resulting in lower unallocated overheads.

Non-cash compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was
$0.33 million, an increase of $0.07 million, or approximately 28% from $0.26
million for the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was due to the
issuance of options to purchase an aggregate of 4,334,000 shares of Common Stock
to various employees during the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily pursuant to
employment agreements, and the timing of the amortization schedule established
at the time of issuance of the related stock options



Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 was
$0.67 million, an increase of $0.05 million, or 8% from $0.62 million of such
costs for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the
expansion and upgrading of the Northvale Facility, which has required
substantial investments in property, plant and equipment.



As a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March
31, 2016 was $8.3 million, compared to a loss from operations of $16.5 million
for the year ended March 31, 2015.

Other income for the year ended March 31, 2016 totaled a net other income of
$7.1 million, a decrease in net other income of $14.6 million from the net other
income of $21.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in other
income was due to the change in the fair value of our outstanding warrants
(derivative instruments) during the year ended March 31, 2016 totaling $7.4
million, as compared to a net derivative income of $20.3 million and gain on
sale of investment totaling $1.7 for the year ended March 31, 2015, a $14.6
million overall decrease in other income. Please note that the change in fair
value of derivative instruments is determined in large part by the number of
warrants outstanding and the change in the closing price of our Common Stock as
of the end of the year, as compared to the closing price at the beginning of the
year, with a strong inverse relationship between derivative revenues and
increases in the closing price of our Common Stock.




As a result of the foregoing, our net loss from operations before the net
benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits for the year ended March
31, 2016, including credits for income taxes totaling $0.5 million was $1.2
million, compared to a net income of $5.2 million, inclusive of credit for
income taxes totaling $0.003 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.
Net benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits
During the year ended March 31, 2016, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Elite, received final approval from the New Jersey Economic Development
Authority for the sale of net tax benefits. The Company sold the net tax
benefits approved for total proceeds of $520,452.
Change in value of Series I convertible preferred stock:
Changes in the value in our Series I convertible preferred stock, which is
included in the calculation of net loss attributable to common shareholders
resulted in the net loss being increased by $9.3 million for the year ended
March 31, 2016, as compared to an increase in net income attributable to common
shareholders of $23.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. Accordingly,
net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders for the year ended March
31, 2016 was net loss of $10.0 million, compared to net income attributable to
common shareholders of $28.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.

                                March 31,
                          2017             2016            Change
Current assets        $ 18,412,720     $ 16,713,956     $  1,698,764

Working capital         15,067,974       12,073,767        2,994,207




The Company considers cash and working capital balances as several of the
factors the Company uses in evaluating its performance, without limitation. As
of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash on hand of $10.6 million and a working
capital surplus of $15.1 million. The Company believes that such resources,
combined with the Company's access to the new equity line with Lincoln Park
Capital (see below), are sufficient to fund operations through the current
operating cycle. For the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company had losses from
operations totaling $7.4 million, net other income totaling $9.3 million and net
income of $3.8 million. In addition, changes in the carrying value of preferred
share mezzanine equity for the year ended March 31, 2017 were an increase of
$20.7 million, with such amount being charged to net income available to common
shareholders. Please note that the Company's other income/(expenses) and net
income available to common shareholders are significantly influenced by the
fluctuations in the fair value of outstanding preferred share and warrant
derivatives, and that such fair values bear a strong, inverse correlation to the
market share price of the Company's Common Stock.



Our working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities)
increased by $3.0 million from $12.1 million as of March 31, 2016 to $15.1
million as of March 31, 2017, with such increase being primarily related to
capital financings that included $7.6 million in proceeds from the sale of
Common Stock pursuant to the 2014 Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and $1.9
million in proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and options, offset in
large part by purchases of fixed assets and leasehold improvements totaling $1.1
million and payment on principal of $0.2 million in NJEDA Bonds and other loans.
Please note that capital financings provide cash to the Company without a
corresponding current liability and accordingly have an accretive effect on
working capital.



The Company does not anticipate being profitable for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2018, due in large part to its plans to conduct clinical development
and commercialization activities on a range of abuse deterrent opioid products,
on an accelerated and simultaneous basis. Such activities require the investment
of significant amounts in clinical trials, safety and efficacy studies,
bioequivalence studies, product manufacturing, regulatory expertise and filings,
as well as investments in manufacturing and lab equipment and software. In order
to finance these significant expenditures, the Company entered into a new
purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, with such agreement providing
the Company with an equity line totaling $40 million. We believe this amount of
financing, if received, is sufficient to fund the commercialization of the abuse
deterrent opioid products identified. Please see below for further details on
the financing transactions with Lincoln Park.



In addition, the Company had previously received Notices of Default from the
Trustee of the NJEDA Bonds as a result of the utilization of the debt service
reserve being used to pay interest payments as well as the company's failure to
make scheduled principal payments. All monetary defaults have been cured during
Fiscal 2015 and the Company is current on all NJEDA Bond interest and principal
payments. See "NJEDA Bonds" below and the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A
entitled "A notice of default was issued by the New Jersey Economic Development
Authority in relation to prior obligations of our tax-exempt bonds. Although we
are current in our payments under these bonds, If the principal balances due
under these bonds are accelerated pursuant to the notice of default, our ability
to operate in the future will be materially and adversely affected".

Lincoln Park Capital



On April 10, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and a Registration
Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park (the "2014 LPC Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant
to the terms of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park had agreed to
purchase from us up to $40 million of our common stock (subject to certain
limitations) from time to time over a 36-month period.
Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 1,928,641 shares of our
common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as consideration
for its commitment to purchase additional shares of our common stock under that
agreement and were obligated to issue up to an additional 1,928,641 commitment
shares to Lincoln Park pro rata as up to $40 million of our common stock is
purchased by Lincoln Park.



The 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement expired on June 1, 2017. During the term of the
2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, we sold an aggregate of 110.6 million shares to
Lincoln Park, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $27.0 million. In
addition, we issued an aggregate of 3.2 million commitment shares.




On May 1, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the "2017 LPC Purchase
Agreement"), together with a registration rights agreement (the "2017 LPC
Registration Rights Agreement"), with Lincoln Park.



  64






Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2017 LPC Purchase
Agreement, we have the right to sell to and Lincoln Park is obligated to
purchase up to $40 million in shares of our common stock ("Common Stock"),
subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period
commencing on June 5, 2017. We may direct Lincoln Park, at our sole discretion
and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common
Stock on any business day, provided that at least one business day has passed
since the most recent purchase, increasing to up to 1,000,000 shares, depending
upon the closing sale price of the Common Stock (such purchases, "Regular
Purchases"). However, in no event shall a Regular Purchase be more than
$1,000,000. The purchase price of shares of Common Stock related to the future
funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time
of sales. In addition, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts
as accelerated purchases under certain circumstances. Our sales of shares of
Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement are limited
to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial
ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of
more than 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.



In connection with the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued to Lincoln Park
5,540,550 shares of Common Stock and we are required to issue up to 5,540,550
additional shares of Common Stock pro rata as we require Lincoln Park to
purchase our shares under the Purchase Agreement over the term of the agreement.
Lincoln Park has represented to us, among other things, that it is an
"accredited investor" (as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")). We sold
the securities in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in
Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The securities sold may not be offered
or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption
from
registration requirements.



The 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement and the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement
contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions to
completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of
the parties. We have the right to terminate the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement at
any time, at no cost or penalty. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to
Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to
be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market
conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to
the appropriate sources of funding for us and our operations. There are no
trading volume requirements or, other than the limitation on beneficial
ownership discussed above, restrictions under the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln
Park has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases
from us as we direct in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has
covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or
indirect short selling or hedging of our shares.



The net proceeds received by us under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will
depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our stock to
Lincoln Park. We anticipate that any proceeds received by us from such sales to
Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will be used for research and
product development, general corporate purposes and working capital
requirements.




A registration statement on form S-3 was filed with the SEC on May 10, 2017 and

Hakim $1,000,000 Bridge Revolving Credit Line




On October 15, 2013 (the "Hakim Credit Line Effective Date"), and as amended on

Agreement") with Nasrat Hakim, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President
and CEO. Under the terms of the Hakim Loan Agreement, we have the right, in our
sole discretion, to a line of credit ("Hakim Credit Line") in the maximum
principal amount of up to $1,000,000 at any one time. Mr. Hakim provided the
Credit Line for the purpose of supporting the acceleration of our product
development activities. The outstanding amount matured on March 31, 2016.
Amounts borrowed under the Hakim Credit Line bear interest at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum. As of March 31, 2016, the principal balance owed under
the Credit Line was $718k with an additional $71k in accrued interest being also
owed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Line. The entire
principal amount due under the Hakim Credit Line, which expired on March 31,
2016, was paid on May 24, 2016. An additional $9k in interest, accrued at an
annual rate of 10%, was incurred on the principal balance outstanding during the
period beginning on April 1, 2016 and ending on May 24, 2016, the date on which
the principal balance was paid. All interest amounts owed in relation to
principal balances outstanding on the Hakim Credit Line and consisting of
interest amounts due and owing as of March 31, 2016 and interest amounts
incurred subsequent to March 31, 2016 and up to the date of principal repayment,

Convertible Note Payable to Mikah Pharma LLC




On August 1, 2013, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
executed an asset purchase agreement (the "Mikah Purchase Agreement") with Mikah
Pharma LLC ("Mikah"), an entity that is wholly owned by Mr. Nasrat Hakim, who,
in conjunction with this transaction, was appointed as Elite's CEO, President
and a Director on August 2, 2012, and acquired from Mikah a total of 13
Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") consisting of 12 ANDAs approved by
the FDA and one ANDA under active review with the FDA, and all amendments
thereto (the "Acquisition") for aggregate consideration of $10,000,000,
inclusive of imputed interest payable pursuant to a non-interest bearing,
secured convertible note due in August 2016 (the "Mikah Note"). Please see
"Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs")" in Part I, Item 1
Business, above for more information on the Acquisition. The Mikah Note was
amended on February 7, 2014 to make it convertible into shares of the Company's
Series I Convertible Preferred Stock.



The Mikah Note, as amended, was interest free and due and payable on the third
anniversary of its issuance. Subject to certain limitations, the principal
amount of the Mikah Note was convertible at the option of Mikah into shares of
Common Stock at a rate of $0.07 (approximately 14,286 shares per $1,000 in
principal amount), the closing market price of the Company's Common Stock on the
date that the asset purchase agreement and Note were executed and/or into shares
of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock at the rate of 1 share of
Series I Preferred Stock for each $100,000 of principal owed on the Mikah Note.
The conversion rate was adjustable for customary corporate actions such as stock
splits and, subject to certain exclusions, includes weighted average
anti-dilution for common stock transactions at prices below the then applicable
conversion rate. Pursuant to a security agreement (the "Security Agreement"),
repayment of the Mikah Note was secured by the ANDAs acquired in the
Acquisition.




On February 7, 2014, Mikah converted the principal amount of $10,000,000,
representing the entire principal balance due under the Mikah Note, into 100
shares of the Company's Series I Preferred Stock, and was retired.



NJEDA Bonds



On August 31, 2005, the Company successfully completed a refinancing of a prior
1999 bond issue through the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds (the "Bonds"). The
refinancing involved borrowing $4,155,000, evidenced by a 6.5% Series A Note in
the principal amount of $3,660,000 maturing on September 1, 2030 and a 9% Series
B Note in the principal amount of $495,000 maturing on September 1, 2012. The
net proceeds, after payment of issuance costs, were used (i) to redeem the
outstanding tax-exempt Bonds originally issued by the Authority on September 2,
1999, (ii) refinance other equipment financing and (iii) for the purchase of
certain equipment to be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. As
of March 31, 2016, all of the proceeds were utilized by the Company for such
stated purposes.



Interest is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The
Bonds are collateralized by a first lien on the Company's facility and equipment
acquired with the proceeds of the original and refinanced Bonds. The related
Indenture requires the maintenance of a Debt Service Reserve Fund of $366,000 in
relation to the Series A Notes.




Bond issue costs of $354,000 were paid from the bond proceeds and are being
amortized over the life of the bonds. Amortization of bond issuance costs
amounted to $14,179 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.



  66






The NJEDA Bonds require the Company to make an annual principal payment on
September 1st of varying amounts as specified in the loan documents and
semi-annual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st, equal to interest
due on the outstanding principal at the applicable rate for the semi-annual
period just ended.
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no
interest or principal amounts in arrears. The Series B Notes were retired, at
par in July 2014.

 1 Consists of lease payments pursuant to the operating lease for 135 Ludlow Ave
   for a period, exclusive of taxes and insurance, expiring on December 31, 2021.
   The lease also includes an additional five-year option, exercised at the sole
   discretion of the Company and at fixed rates, which are defined in the lease.
   Due to the relevance to the Company's operations, of the facility at 135 Ludlow
   Avenue, the Company expects to exercise the first five-year option. If such
   option were to be exercised, a new contractual obligation would be created,
   with payments totaling $1.2 million, exclusive of real estate taxes and
   insurance, over the full five-year term of the option period.




Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that would be considered
material to investors.



Effects of Inflation



We are subject to price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market
prices of the products that we sell. Management does not believe that inflation
risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.



Cybersecurity



As of March 31, 2017, the Company had no reportable incidents of cybersecurity.



  67






Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are
those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex
estimates.



Revenue Recognition



The Company enters into licensing, manufacturing and development agreements,
which may include multiple revenue generating activities, including, without
limitation, milestones, licensing fees, product sales and services. These
multiple elements are assessed in accordance with ASC 605-25, Revenue
Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements in order to determine whether
particular components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting.



An arrangement component is considered to be a separate unit of accounting if
the deliverable relating to the component has value to the customer on a
standalone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return
relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item
is considered probable and substantially in control of the Company.



The Company recognizes payments received pursuant to a multiple revenue
agreement as revenue, only if the related delivered item(s) have stand-alone
value, with the arrangement being accordingly accounted for as a separate unit
of accounting. If such delivered item(s) are considered to either not have
stand-alone value, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of
accounting, and the payments received are recognized as revenue over the
estimated period of when performance obligations relating to the item(s) will be
performed.



Whenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a
single unit of accounting, it determines the period over which the performance
obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. If it cannot
reasonably estimate the timing and the level of effort to complete its
performance obligations under a multiple-element arrangement, revenues are then
recognized on a straight-line basis over the period encompassing the expected
completion of such obligations, with such period being reassessed at each
subsequent reporting period.



Arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to
all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price (the relative
selling price method). When applying the relative selling price method, the
selling price of each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective
evidence of selling price, if such exists; otherwise, third-part evidence of
selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party
evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, the Company uses its best
estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative
selling price method. In deciding whether we can determine vendor-specific
objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, the Company does
not ignore information that is reasonably available without undue cost and
effort.



When determining the selling price for significant deliverables under a
multiple-element revenue arrangement, the Company considers any or all of the
following, without limitation, depending on information available or information
that could be reasonably available without undue cost and effort:
vendor-specific objective evidence, third party evidence or best estimate of
selling price. More specifically, factors considered can include, without
limitation and as appropriate, size of market for a specific product, number of
suppliers and other competitive market factors, forecast market shares and gross
profits, barriers/time frames to market entry/launch, intellectual property
rights and protections, exclusive or non-exclusive arrangements, costs of
similar/identical deliverables from third parties, contractual terms, including,
without limitation, length of contract, renewal rights, commercial terms, profit
allocations, and other commercial, financial, tangible and intangible factors
that may be relevant in the valuation of a specific deliverable.



  68






Milestone payments are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605-28, Revenue
Recognition - Milestone Method for any deliverables or units of accounting under
which the Company must achieve a defined performance obligation which is
contingent upon future events or circumstances that are uncertain as of the
inception of the arrangement providing for such future milestone payment.
Determination of the substantiveness of a milestone is a matter of subjective
assessment performed at the inception of the arrangement, and with consideration
earned from the achievement of a milestone meeting all of the following:




  It must be either commensurate with the Company's performance in achieving the
   milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result
   of a specific outcome resulting from the Company's performance to achieve the
   milestone; and




  It relates solely to past performance; and
  It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms
   (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement.
Collaborative Arrangements
Contracts are considered to be collaborative arrangements when they satisfy the
following criteria defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements:
  The parties to the contract must actively participate in the joint operating
   activity; and




  The joint operating activity must expose the parties to the possibility of
   significant risk and rewards, based on whether or not the activity is
   successful.




The Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement with Epic
Pharma LLC, dated June 4, 2015 (the "2015 Epic License Agreement"), which has
been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative
agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.




The Company entered into a Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen
Pharma LLC dated August 24, 2016 (the "SunGen Agreement"), which has been
determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative
agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.



Accounts Receivable



Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net of
estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability,
historical trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed on a
periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances.



Intangible Assets



The Company capitalizes certain costs to acquire intangible assets; if such
assets are determined to have a finite useful life they are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Costs to acquire indefinite
lived intangible assets, such as costs related to ANDAs are capitalized
accordingly.




The Company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually (as of
March 31st) and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment
may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining
if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among
others and without limitation: a significant decline in the Company's expected
future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company's stock price
and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in
the business climate of the Company's segments; unanticipated competition;
and
slower growth rates.



As of March 31, 2017, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment.



  69






Income Taxes



Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. Where applicable, the Company records a valuation
allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets that it determines will not be
realizable in the future.



The Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has
taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax position is
more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
based on the technical merits of the position. These tax benefits are measured
based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate resolution.



Stock-Based Compensation



The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic
718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition
provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant
date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the
awards. The cost of the stock-based payments to nonemployees that are fully
vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is measured and recognized at
that date, unless there is a contractual term for services in which case such
compensation would be amortized over the contractual term.



In accordance with the Company's Director compensation policy and certain
employment contracts, director's fees and a portion of employee's salaries are
to be paid via the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of
cash, with the valuation of such share being calculated on a quarterly basis and
equal to the simple average closing price of the Company's common stock.



Warrants and Preferred Shares



The accounting treatment of warrants and preferred share series issued is
determined pursuant to the guidance provided by ASC 470, Debt, ASC 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as
applicable. Each feature of a freestanding financial instruments including,
without limitation, any rights relating to subsequent dilutive issuances,
dividend issuances, equity sales, rights offerings, forced conversions, optional
redemptions, automatic monthly conversions, dividends and exercise are assessed
with determinations made regarding the proper classification in the Company's
financial statements.



Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs ("ASU 2015-3"). ASU 2015-3 revises previous guidance to require
that debt issuance costs be reported in the audited consolidated financial
statements as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability,
consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the amendments,
debt issuance costs were presented as a deferred charge (i.e. an asset) on the
audited consolidated financial statements. This new guidance is effective for
the annual period ending after December 15, 2015, and for annual periods and
interim periods thereafter. The amendments must be applied retrospectively. The
Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03. Refer to Note 2 Change in
Accounting Principle for the effect of adopting ASU 2015-03 on the consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.




Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. This standard
is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The
amendments in this update deferred the effective date for implementation of ASU
2014-09 by one year and is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim reporting
periods within that period. Topic 606 is effective for the Company in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU
2014-09 and related ASUs noted below on its audited consolidated financial
statements.



  70






From March through December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU
2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09
and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting,
ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections
and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These
amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of
Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are
the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09
and ASU No. 2015-14.



In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory (Topic 330) ("ASU 2015-11"). The amendments in ASU 2015-11 clarify the
determination of net realizable value of inventory, applicable to measurement of
inventory asset value on the balance sheet. The amendments do not change the
core principal of the guidance provided in Topic 330, specifically the valuation
of inventory at the lower of cost or market value, with market value being
determined by the net realizable value of the inventory item(s). The amendments
clarify, however, that net realizable value is to be measured as the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable
costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for
the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and
interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as
of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is
currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-11 on its audited consolidated
financial statements.



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU
2016-02"), which is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required
to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term
leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the
lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease
term. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-02 on its
audited consolidated financial statements.



In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting (Topic 718) ("ASU 2016-09"). The amendments in ASU 2016-09
provide revised guidance in relation to the following with regards to share
based payments: i) Accounting for forfeitures, ii) Income tax effects, and iii)
classification of excess tax benefits. The guidance is effective for the annual
period beginning after December 15, 2016, a

Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.
