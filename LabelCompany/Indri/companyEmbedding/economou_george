George Economou - Unfinished and Uncollected

	ISBN 9781848614369. Paperback, 9x6ins. 100pp. Download a sample PDF from this book here.

	"Invaluable as they are, these retrieved Cavafy poems at moments seem a prologue to Economou's own, so deeply has he assimilated, in the course of decades of translation, both the older poet and the store of Greek classic poetry in which he also was invested. But the very American wit and formal hijinks are Economou's own, as are the grace, for instance, of an epithalamion that Sappho might have sung—this isn't pastiche, but a bringing of past into present, as Cavafy did, and also of present into past. This is the stance of irony, which demands a double vision. As its final gift this eloquent book treats us to a fractured narrative of the poet's education in the irony that is and has been an essential armament of survival for those in both his benighted lands." ––Mark Weiss

	 

	Three cheers for continuations, real or imagined, for the various post-Homerica, even for the chimerical Lollius, and Henryson's Testament of Cresseid. Economou’s steering of Cavafy's Ta Atelē to their unwritten télē ought to remind us that without Wide Sargasso Sea, Jane Eyre would still be a sad little non-starter." ––Stavros Deligiorgis 

	 

	“George Economou is one of those rare writers, like the ancient Ananios, whom you wish you had invented, even if he exists. He can show how the world is finished in poetry, as poetry is a way to unfinish words. He can also set the angels straight by demonstrating that translation and poetry as half-siblings are often more interbred than offspring of a common tongue. Cavafy should be pleased.” ––Yiorgos Chouliaras

George Economou - Ananios of Kleitor

Paperback, 144pp, 9x6ins

	Download a PDF sampler from this book here.

Ananios of Kleitor introduces to the revolving stage of world literature the work of an ancient Greek poet largely unknown and hitherto unread outside of a small circle of cognoscenti. The poet's extant poems and fragments, as well as the record of their reception and preservation, are presented in this one-of-a-kind book of the sort that would have appealed to Menippus of Gadara and his followers, a medley of verse and prose and a diversity of genres, ranging from the epistolary novel to scholarly annotations and an Index Nominum. Ananios and his scholars and commentators perform their work at the edge of the real world and the margins of a thoroughly historicized and critically acute context. Ananios was born in 399 BC in the Arcadian city of Kleitor according to the third century AD author Theonaeus, who refers to a lost work by Chamaemelon of Patrae on the poets of Achaia and Arcadia in which the poet's birth is said to have occurred during the Nemean Crown Games following the 95th Olympiad. Forty-one poems and fragments of his have survived, along with twenty-five passages of verse attributed to him in quotations cited in various commentaries and literary works extending from the second century BC to the eleventh century AD. The fragmentary nature of so much of his writing makes it impossible for us to speak with full confidence about the range of his subject matter, though the ancient and Byzantine attestations, sparse as they may be, primarily identify him as an amatory poet.

Early life[edit]
Economou was born in Athens, where his father owned a small paper-products company.[2] He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he obtained an MSc in naval architecture and marine engineering, and another MSc in shipping and shipbuilding management.[2]
Career[edit]
In 2005, DryShips (DRYS) was listed on Nasdaq, but Cardiff Marine is privately owned by Economou.[2] Economou owns 34% of DryShips, but has been accused of running it like a private company for personal profit at shareholders' expense, destroying any shareholder value over the last several years with massive dilution and dubious forms of financing.[3][4][5] Economou has allegedly lied to the SEC in multiple 6-K filings and is now being investigated.[6] Despite the privileged tax status of the shipping industry in Greece - the industry pays no tax on international earnings brought into the country under rules incorporated in Greece’s constitution in 1967 - traders and other finance professionals caution against investing in companies run by Economou, on the grounds that his business strategy is to acquire assets personally and sell them on to his public companies for a profit, Economou getting cash while shareholders inherit operating risks exacerbated by further share dilutions.[7][4] Lloydslist remarks that "No one who calls their yacht Barracuda can be too concerned about safeguarding an angelic image."[8]
Since 2008, Economou has allegedly been doing affiliate transactions from his own private company to steal shareholder value.[9][10]
In March 2015, he had a net worth of $1.5 billion, and a fleet of 116 ships, according to Bloomberg.[11]
In November 2016, DryShips announced $100 million in financing from Kalani, a mysterious company based in the British Virgin Islands and Jersey, Channel Islands, which the "Panama Papers" show was incorporated on March 22, 1990 but struck off on October 31, 1991 after defaulting.[12] Currently, it is impossible to prove Economou is directly involved in the ownership of Kalani due to the British Virgin Islands status as an offshore tax haven that provides secrecy for its clients.
On December 15, 2016, DryShips announced a “comprehensive refinancing, deleveraging and strategic repositioning” that included upping the company’s credit facility to $200 million. It also included a $33.5 million payment to Economou.[3]
On December 27, 2016, Kalani came up with another $200 million refinancing agreement. DryShips then announced a new option contract to purchase 4 VLGC ships from other companies controlled by Economou at a total potential cost of $334 million for DryShips shareholders. Investors and traders speculate that Economou pulls the strings at Kalani, using it to recapitalize DryShips and unload assets at the expense of DryShips shareholders.[3]
In 2016 and 2017 Economou diluted DryShips shares four times through reverse split (total reverse split is 12,000 : 1) to decrease DryShips outstanding shares to 1 million. Then he issued 60 million new shares to make affiliate transactions from his own private company to sell DryShips four overpriced very large gas carriers (VLGC). In 2017, he reverse split the shares again at 8:1.[13][6][14]
Art collector[edit]
In 2006, he started collecting art, mainly from European artists of the early 20th century such as George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Christian Schad, Werner Schramm, Andy Warhol, Diego Rivera, Fernando Botero, Hermann Scherer and Heinrich Hoerle.[15][16]
Personal life[edit]
Economou's two former wives own a total 15% of DryShips. His sister, Chryssoula Kandylidis, owns 30% of Cardiff Marine. His nephew Antonios Kandylidis, is the founder and largest shareholder in OceanFreight, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2007.[2]

Early life[edit]
Economou was born in Athens, where his father owned a small paper-products company.[2] He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he obtained an MSc in naval architecture and marine engineering, and another MSc in shipping and shipbuilding management.[2]
Career[edit]
In 2005, DryShips (DRYS) was listed on Nasdaq, but Cardiff Marine is privately owned by Economou.[2] Economou owns 34% of DryShips, but has been accused of running it like a private company for personal profit at shareholders' expense, destroying any shareholder value over the last several years with massive dilution and dubious forms of financing.[3][4][5] Economou has allegedly lied to the SEC in multiple 6-K filings and is now being investigated.[6] Despite the privileged tax status of the shipping industry in Greece - the industry pays no tax on international earnings brought into the country under rules incorporated in Greece’s constitution in 1967 - traders and other finance professionals caution against investing in companies run by Economou, on the grounds that his business strategy is to acquire assets personally and sell them on to his public companies for a profit, Economou getting cash while shareholders inherit operating risks exacerbated by further share dilutions.[7][4] Lloydslist remarks that "No one who calls their yacht Barracuda can be too concerned about safeguarding an angelic image."[8]
Since 2008, Economou has allegedly been doing affiliate transactions from his own private company to steal shareholder value.[9][10]
In March 2015, he had a net worth of $1.5 billion, and a fleet of 116 ships, according to Bloomberg.[11]
In November 2016, DryShips announced $100 million in financing from Kalani, a mysterious company based in the British Virgin Islands and Jersey, Channel Islands, which the "Panama Papers" show was incorporated on March 22, 1990 but struck off on October 31, 1991 after defaulting.[12] Currently, it is impossible to prove Economou is directly involved in the ownership of Kalani due to the British Virgin Islands status as an offshore tax haven that provides secrecy for its clients.
On December 15, 2016, DryShips announced a “comprehensive refinancing, deleveraging and strategic repositioning” that included upping the company’s credit facility to $200 million. It also included a $33.5 million payment to Economou.[3]
On December 27, 2016, Kalani came up with another $200 million refinancing agreement. DryShips then announced a new option contract to purchase 4 VLGC ships from other companies controlled by Economou at a total potential cost of $334 million for DryShips shareholders. Investors and traders speculate that Economou pulls the strings at Kalani, using it to recapitalize DryShips and unload assets at the expense of DryShips shareholders.[3]
In 2016 and 2017 Economou diluted DryShips shares four times through reverse split (total reverse split is 12,000 : 1) to decrease DryShips outstanding shares to 1 million. Then he issued 60 million new shares to make affiliate transactions from his own private company to sell DryShips four overpriced very large gas carriers (VLGC). In 2017, he reverse split the shares again at 8:1.[13][6][14]
Art collector[edit]
In 2006, he started collecting art, mainly from European artists of the early 20th century such as George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Christian Schad, Werner Schramm, Andy Warhol, Diego Rivera, Fernando Botero, Hermann Scherer and Heinrich Hoerle.[15][16]
Personal life[edit]
Economou's two former wives own a total 15% of DryShips. His sister, Chryssoula Kandylidis, owns 30% of Cardiff Marine. His nephew Antonios Kandylidis, is the founder and largest shareholder in OceanFreight, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2007.[2]

Early life[edit]
Economou was born in Athens, where his father owned a small paper-products company.[2] He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he obtained an MSc in naval architecture and marine engineering, and another MSc in shipping and shipbuilding management.[2]
Career[edit]
In 2005, DryShips (DRYS) was listed on Nasdaq, but Cardiff Marine is privately owned by Economou.[2] Economou owns 34% of DryShips, but has been accused of running it like a private company for personal profit at shareholders' expense, destroying any shareholder value over the last several years with massive dilution and dubious forms of financing.[3][4][5] Economou has allegedly lied to the SEC in multiple 6-K filings and is now being investigated.[6] Despite the privileged tax status of the shipping industry in Greece - the industry pays no tax on international earnings brought into the country under rules incorporated in Greece’s constitution in 1967 - traders and other finance professionals caution against investing in companies run by Economou, on the grounds that his business strategy is to acquire assets personally and sell them on to his public companies for a profit, Economou getting cash while shareholders inherit operating risks exacerbated by further share dilutions.[7][4] Lloydslist remarks that "No one who calls their yacht Barracuda can be too concerned about safeguarding an angelic image."[8]
Since 2008, Economou has allegedly been doing affiliate transactions from his own private company to steal shareholder value.[9][10]
In March 2015, he had a net worth of $1.5 billion, and a fleet of 116 ships, according to Bloomberg.[11]
In November 2016, DryShips announced $100 million in financing from Kalani, a mysterious company based in the British Virgin Islands and Jersey, Channel Islands, which the "Panama Papers" show was incorporated on March 22, 1990 but struck off on October 31, 1991 after defaulting.[12] Currently, it is impossible to prove Economou is directly involved in the ownership of Kalani due to the British Virgin Islands status as an offshore tax haven that provides secrecy for its clients.
On December 15, 2016, DryShips announced a “comprehensive refinancing, deleveraging and strategic repositioning” that included upping the company’s credit facility to $200 million. It also included a $33.5 million payment to Economou.[3]
On December 27, 2016, Kalani came up with another $200 million refinancing agreement. DryShips then announced a new option contract to purchase 4 VLGC ships from other companies controlled by Economou at a total potential cost of $334 million for DryShips shareholders. Investors and traders speculate that Economou pulls the strings at Kalani, using it to recapitalize DryShips and unload assets at the expense of DryShips shareholders.[3]
In 2016 and 2017 Economou diluted DryShips shares four times through reverse split (total reverse split is 12,000 : 1) to decrease DryShips outstanding shares to 1 million. Then he issued 60 million new shares to make affiliate transactions from his own private company to sell DryShips four overpriced very large gas carriers (VLGC). In 2017, he reverse split the shares again at 8:1.[13][6][14]
Art collector[edit]
In 2006, he started collecting art, mainly from European artists of the early 20th century such as George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Christian Schad, Werner Schramm, Andy Warhol, Diego Rivera, Fernando Botero, Hermann Scherer and Heinrich Hoerle.[15][16]
Personal life[edit]
Economou's two former wives own a total 15% of DryShips. His sister, Chryssoula Kandylidis, owns 30% of Cardiff Marine. His nephew Antonios Kandylidis, is the founder and largest shareholder in OceanFreight, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2007.[2]

DryShips Inc. (DRYS): George Economou
According, to his bio, “George Economou has over 30 years of experience in the maritime industry and has served as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dryships Inc. since its incorporation in 2004. He successfully took the Company public in February 2005, on NASDAQ under the trading symbol: DRYS. Mr. Economou has overseen the Company’s growth into one of the largest US listed drybulk company in fleet size and revenue and the third largest Panamax owner in the world. The Company subsequently invested in and developed Ocean Rig UDW Inc., an owner of drilling rigs and drillships involved in ultra deepwater drilling. Mr. Economou is the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Rig UDW Inc. Mr. Economou is a member of ABS Council, Intertanko Hellenic Shipping Forum and Lloyds Register Hellenic Advisory Committees.”

“Since 2000, Mr. Economou has been a director and the President of AllShips Ltd. and, since 2010, he has been a member of the board of directors of Danaos Corporation. Apart from his shipping interests, Mr. Economou has also invested in real estate. Mr. Economou is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and holds both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and a Master of Science in Shipping and Shipbuilding Management.”



Thoughts: George Economou appears to have an empire of several kinds of shipping companies as well, including container ships and drill ships. He’s involved with shipping committees but doesn’t have as many ties with financial institutions as Angeliki Frangou does. I wonder how he did in real estate, just out of curiosity. He graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, and Shipping and Shipbuilding Management—very specific and tailored to the marine shipping industry. On a side note, he’s 60 years old.
