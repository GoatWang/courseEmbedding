History[edit]
Founding and early history[edit]




Alexander Brown



Alexander Brown (1764 — 1834), an Irish linen merchant, emigrated in 1800 from Ballymena in Ulster to the United States, settling in Baltimore, Maryland, where he established the first investment banking firm in the U.S.[1] In 1808, the company organized the first initial public offering in the U.S., that of the Baltimore Water Company.[1]




Alex. Brown & Sons Building in Baltimore, Maryland


In 1810, Alexander Brown was joined in business by his sons, William, George, John, and James, and the firm was named Alex. Brown and Sons, Inc.[2] By the 1820s, Alexander Brown had expanded his business interests into sterling exchange and international trade, including tobacco and cotton.[3]
Brown's sons eventually started related businesses in various locations, beginning with William. William founded William Brown and Company in Liverpool, England, which later became Brown, Shipley & Co. In 1818, John and James started Brown Bros. & Co. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. James subsequently opened a branch in New York City in 1825, a predecessor to Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.[2]
George remained at the firm's Baltimore headquarters, where he took a leading role in the founding of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1827. Upon Alexander Brown's death in 1834, George became the head of Alex. Brown and Sons, which proclaimed itself "America's foremost international banking enterprise in the nineteenth century."[2]
Some historical records of Alex Brown & Sons are housed in the manuscript collections at New-York Historical Society.
Acquisition by Bankers Trust, Integration into Deutsche Bank, and Acquisition by Raymond James[edit]




BT Alex. Brown logo in use between 1997 and 1999 following its acquisition by Bankers Trust


At the time the oldest privately held bank in the U.S., Alex. Brown & Sons was bought by Bankers Trust in 1997 to form BT Alex. Brown. Two years later, in 1999, BT Alex. Brown was acquired by Deutsche Bank. BT paid $1.7 billion in a stock acquisition of Alex. Brown.
The Alex Brown name initially survived as Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, the brokerage services division of Deutsche Bank Securities. September 2016 marked a new chapter for Alex Brown Wealth Management when it was officially sold to Raymond James.[4]
The company provides a range of advisory, brokerage, research, and investment services to high-net-worth individual investors in the US. It performs research on more than 2,500 stocks, as well as corporate bonds and foreign securities.
Noted alumni[edit]
Alex. Brown's chairman in 1998 was A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard, who was appointed Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2001.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that BT Alex. Brown Inc. had agreed to pay $15.3 million to settle allegations that the brokerage firm defrauded the federal government and the state of Pennsylvania in municipal bond transactions in the early 1990's.The settlement is the largest yet won by federal officials, who have been investigating accusations that several Wall Street firms engaged in  ''yield burning,'' or profiting heavily by vastly inflating the prices of government securities.As part of its investigation, the S.E.C. also charged six people, including the former head of public finance at BT Alex. Brown and a key adviser to the former state treasurer of Pennsylvania, and three other companies with participating in the activity, which S.E.C. officials said included influence peddling and undisclosed financial arrangements.In resolving its case, BT Alex. Brown, now a unit of Deutsche Bank, also reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, both of which had been investigating the case. The firm said it neither acknowledged nor denied wrongdoing.

As part of the case, the S.E.C. filed a securities fraud complaint against Patrick H. McCarthy III for his role in two bond offerings in 1994.

The S.E.C. said that although he was not a state employee, Mr. McCarthy used his influence as a fund-raiser and key adviser to the former state treasurer, Catherine Baker Knoll, to influence state decisions and steer business to Alex. Brown on the condition that the brokerage firm agree to split its fees with the state's financial adviser, Arthurs Lestrange & Company, a Pittsburgh brokerage firm. The S.E.C. said that Mr. McCarthy then arranged to have a consultant to the financial adviser make a payment to his law firm. Continue reading the main story

The S.E.C. does not contend that either Alex. Brown or the financial adviser were aware of the payments to Mr. McCarthy's law firm. But the agency said Mr. McCarthy failed to disclose to the state of Pennsylvania the compensation that his law firm received. No state officials were charged with wrongdoing.Mr. McCarthy, a prominent Pennsylvania lawyer, could not be reached for comment yesterday. But his lawyer issued a statement on his behalf that read, ''Rather than face years of litigation and attendant legal fees, my family and I decided to move on with our lives.'' Mr. McCarthy agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000; his law firm repaid $172,000  to Pennsylvania.Yesterday, the S.E.C. also reached settlements totaling more than $500,000 with several former employees of Alex. Brown; two consulting firms, HDI Inc. and JMS Associates Inc.; and Arthurs Lestrange. Continue reading the main story
