The Ansay Way
Ansay & Associates is committed to providing products and services to our clients through insurance companies that are committed to providing stable, competitive products.






Customer satisfaction is our first and foremost priority. It starts when you call - with a personal greeting from a live operator, and is extended to everything we do.
Ansay & Associates helps people, advising them on insurance and benefit solutions to secure, protect and help grow the American dream.
The Ansay Approach™
The Ansay (4-step strategic process) Approach™ starts with our four step process and five star customer service.  We implement this approach for each customer, personal and business, and each product and service including home, life and auto insurance, financial planning, commercial insurance, employee benefits and corporate retirement plans.
The Ansay Approach™ understands that price is important but it knows value is the most critical element to have satisfied customers in both good and bad times. The Ansay Approach™ includes value-added services as necessary and appropriate. Some of the value-added services are 24/7 claims reporting, ConciergeCONNECT, online access to certificates, auto ID cards, policy details, safety, loss control and claims management services, wellness programs, business seminars, webinars and more… Why? Because… Ansay & Associates is more than insurance. Ansay & Associates is your personal and business solutions partner.

Anticipating my needs. A few years back my policy renewal period was coming up. My agent called to make an appointment. When he arrived, he mentioned he had bad news to deliver, my premiums were going up. Partly due to my business growth and partly due to . . well premiums go up. My agent anticipated my needs and shopped for a lower rate that still met my needs. He had two proposals with him on the day he arrived with the bad news, which turned out to be good news.Kenlyn Gretz, AMERICOLLECT

It is not often I feel inclined to write a testimonial for our insurance agency, but I am honored to do so for Ansay & Associates LLC.

They are always looking for the best use of my insurance dollars and still providing the coverages that I need. Their genuine interest and concern for me and my business has helped us to continue running a successful business and given me the peace of mind that our needs are being metPeter Burback, Cooks Corner
