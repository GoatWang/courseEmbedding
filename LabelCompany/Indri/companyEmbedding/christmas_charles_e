Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Item Description: London: Pan Books., 1945. FIRST PAN EDITION. Slim octavo, pp.117. With lithographic reproductions of the original illustrations. Publisher's red cloth with titles in gilt, illustrated dust-wrapper. Discreet gift note from 1945, rare jacket with a sizeable chip to front panel (not affecting lettering or artwork), torn to fold, chips to extremities. Shows well. A presentable copy of a particularly scarce and important book; the famous paperback publisher Pan was founded in 1944 and produced their first two books in 1945, being this title and a softcover collection of ghost stories. A Christmas Carol is therefore the first ever hardcover volume issued by Pan and is also the closest possible printing to any centennial commemoration; the jacket blurb explains "amid the stresses and shortages of the war no special centenary edition was issued in Great Britain during 1943. The present edition was planned to appear in time for the first Christmas of Peace on Earth". Listed in 100 Books That Shaped World History [Raftery, 2002]. Also The Observer; All-Time 100 Best Novels [2003], BBC Big Read (200 Best Novels) [2003].  Bookseller Inventory # 47935
