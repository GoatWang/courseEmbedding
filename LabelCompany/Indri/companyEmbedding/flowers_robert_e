I worked with Bob in the early 60s for a computer manufacturing company named Computer Products Inc.in Belmar. Bob was a dedicated worker, devoted family man, and good friend. I believe he was commuting from north Jersey in the  beginning before moving to Toms River. We enjoyed some good times.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
