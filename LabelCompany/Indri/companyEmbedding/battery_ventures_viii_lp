Battery assists its portfolio companies with a range of public-relations and communications issues. Battery’s communications team—led by Vice President Rebecca Buckman and Marketing Manager Alicia Halatsis—is a resource for early-stage companies just starting to tell their stories, as well as more-mature firms that may want to re-position their brands in advance of a liquidity event or restructuring, or get help during a crisis. Battery also employs an outside PR firm to assist with some portfolio-company announcements and offer ongoing, strategic guidance. Specific services include:

Tactical help with news announcements, such as a fundraising or a product launch;
Assistance hiring an outside PR firm or internal PR/marketing staff;
Serving as a liaison with industry and financial conference organizers;
Crisis communications;
Corporate messaging and positioning, and help with PR strategy;
Assistance with strategy on content marketing and executive bylines.



At Battery, business development is built into our DNA. We work tirelessly to connect our portfolio executives with partners and potential new customers. We strive to maintain a set of high-level relationships with CIOs, CTOs, CMOs and other buyers of technology around the globe—as well as with top executives at larger corporations. Whether you are seeking feedback on product/market fit, looking to better understand enterprise buyers’ requirements, or searching for qualified customer introductions, the Battery team is available to provide both guidance as well as introductions to executives from across our network.
We also hold small and large events, ranging from intimate dinners to larger summits, year-round, to facilitate customer and partner introductions.


Talent management and acquisition have long been a focus at Battery. This discipline is led by Kelly Kinnard, Battery’s VP of Talent.  Kelly is a resource for startups needing to create and develop a high-performance organization, as well as for late-stage companies looking for specific executive talent.
Battery’s HR services include:

Directly leading executive searches for portfolio companies;
Managing a preferred group of retained and contingent search firms to support portfolio companies;
Offering advice on employee on-boarding and team building;
Assisting with developing compensation plans.

Strategy
In our private equity practice, we leverage Battery’s 34 years of experience identifying and building technology companies across all stages of development. We work with management teams to accelerate growth, access new markets and transform businesses in the information and industrial technology sectors.  We embrace complex situations and provide highly flexible capital to meet the needs of a diverse range of deal types, including buyouts of family or founder-owned companies; public to privates; and divisional carve-outs of business units. Because we are technology experts, and not just financial investors, we can look beyond basic profit metrics to understand the true potential of a business. We invest in companies with revenue between $5 million and $200 million and build promising businesses into global technology leaders. As a firm, we have raised over $5.6 billion since inception and are now investing our latest funds with a combined capitalization of $950 million.







Team


Our investment staff works together as a single, global unit to evaluate and support potential investments. Every portfolio company — before, during and after we invest — will work with a dedicated team of experts to help it grow.

Companies


Our firm has invested in more than 300 companies over our 34-year history, and we’ve been fortunate to back some very big ideas. We value creativity and innovation, and applaud individuals and teams with a relentless desire to build companies that will redefine technology sectors, industries and the way we live.

As the end result, the planet will be healthier and you won’t have to pay a huge amount of money for a brand new battery, simply because they are very expensive.
Hybrid battery reconditioning
Hybrid cars are some of the best vehicles on the planet and they have two main components, so they are simple as well. The main components are the electric motor and the battery. The battery can last up to 200.000 miles, in most hybrid cars.
If it gets damaged while it is under warranty, the manufacturer will replace it. However, most of these batteries last longer, so they will get damaged after the warranty has expired. In that case, you must pay for a new hybrid battery. You must know that a new battery of this type can cost up to $3.000!
This also means that reconditioning a battery is a great thing you can do. Another fact you should know is that it is possible and it is very simple.
In A rush ? Check out Hybrid battery reconditioning Video Steps By Steps

All hybrid batteries consist of modules. Some cars have more, some less, but each one of them is based on the same principle. For example, the Toyota Prius has 28 modules. When the manufacturer replaces a battery, it will repair the old one and sell it again.
A good thing is that you can do the same. In fact, all you need to do it to replace the damaged module and that battery will last for a long time. The price for this fix is about $700, so it is a lot cheaper than buying a new one. On the other side, the reconditioning battery will last for another 6-7 years, so it is a wise investment as well.
How to recondition a car battery
Car batteries are expensive components in your car. A good thing is the fact you can recondition them and end up with a new battery. The main fact you should know is that a reconditioning battery will have up to 70% of the power of a brand new unit, but this is more than your car needs. All you need to do is to follow these simple steps.
You will need: distilled water, voltmeter, battery charger and syringe. 
1. Remove the battery and remove the rubber that protects the caps. Then, remove the caps as well. Some batteries may have 6-7 caps, but some may have more or less. It is mandatory to remove all of them.
2. Fill a battery with the distilled water and recharge it. Keep in mind that you shouldn’t put the caps back. Place the battery on a charger and charge it for one hour.You should see bubbles on the holes.
If there are no bubbles, reverse the negative and positive wires and wait for 2 minutes. You should see the bubbles now. Reverse the wires to the correct position and recharge the battery for additional 30 minutes.
3. You can also try to replace the acid inside a battery and mix a new acid with the distilled water. Then, recharge the battery for a few hours. In any case, you will get a new battery that can last for a long time.

How to recondition a laptop battery
Laptop battery reconditioning is more than just possible and there are a lot of different ways to achieve that, but some of them may be time consuming. In any case, it is the best choice to try simply because a new laptop battery is expensive and it may cost more than a new laptop.
On the other side, all of these ways are simple and you can do them by yourself. Laptops that have removable batteries are much simpler to do this, but you can try these steps on laptops with non-removable batteries.
In addition, do not use these solutions on a new battery, simply because this will have a negative effect and they will get damaged. In any case, you can recondition an old battery and you will be able to use that laptop for a lot more time. The best part is that all solutions cost nothing.
Solution 1

Remove a battery from your laptop and place it is a plastic bag.
Place it in a freezer and wait for 12 hours. Then, remove it from the bag and clean it.
Place it in a laptop and fully recharge it.

If the battery is not leaking, there is no acid around it, this way will be successful. In any case, you will end up with a new battery that can last for a long time. In addition, you can repeat the procedure a few times.
Solution 2
Some laptops must be ‘’reset’’ in order to get better battery life. This is a very simple solution, but it isn’t very successful. In fact, it is more about recalibrating a laptop than to reconditioning a battery. On the other side, most people have said that this is an effective solution.

Recharge the battery until it is 100% full and leave the laptop for 2-3 hours.
Now, leave the laptop unplugged and wait until the battery is completely empty and your laptop is turned off.
Leave it in this state for 5 hours.
Recharge the battery until it is 100% full. It is known that this solution increases the battery life and will make your laptop get more accurate info about the battery levels.

Solution 3
Reducing the temperature of your laptop seems to have a positive effect on the battery life. All you need to do is to buy the cooler and place a laptop on it. This will reduce the temperature of the battery and the laptop, so the battery will last longer. During the warmer months, this is an even better thing to do.
Solution 4 (BEST ONE – Recommended Video )
Do this to bring ANY old battery back to life – just like new
Solution 5
This method is more than just effective, but it is a time consuming process. In any case, you will have to plug in the battery and wait until it is 100% full. Then wait until it is almost empty, about 5%. Then, plug it in again and recharge it again. Repeat the procedure several times, until you get a reconditioned battery.
Solution 6
This solution may sound weird, but it is very simple. Also, it is only possible if your laptop has a removable battery. You will have to plug a laptop and leaver it charge. When the battery is completely full, remove the battery from a laptop. If your laptop cannot function without a battery, this procedure won’t be effective. On the other side, if it can, the battery life will be extended.
This is possible due to the fact when you do it, you will stop the chemical process in the battery and you will reset it., As the end result, your battery will be able to recharge a lot better and stay full for a longer period of time.
Recondition NiCad Batteries
You should know that NiCad batteries can be reconditioned as well. However, first you should know why they get damaged. This happens, due to the sulfur crystals that eventually reach both terminals and it prevents charging. This can be solved, so your batteries will last for a long time. In addition, the procedure is more than just simple.
Don’t buy 1 new battery – do this instead Video

You are going to need the flash camera capacitor. There are a lot of cheap cameras of this type that you can disassemble and use their parts. You will know what a capacitor is, due to the fact it is a big cylinder part.
Add a battery holder and a switch to the capacitor. Stick the wires to the big black cylinder and connect them with the battery holder and a switch.
Make sure all wires are insulated and they don’t touch anything that can conduct electricity.
Place an alkaline battery into the capacitor and the NiCad battery into the holder you added before.
Then, press the switch and wait the LED to glow. Then repeat the step. Keep in mind that you should hear a sound, that’s meansthat the sulfur crystals are destroyed and your battery can be used again.

Once you make this ‘’gadget’’ you can use it for reconditioning NiCad batteries for ever. It may sound complicated, but it is very simple, and you cannot make a mistake. In addition, it is possible to buy a capacitor for this application, but it is too much expensive and it won’t do the job better than this device.
How To Recondition Lead Acid batteries
Lead acid batteries are expensive, so reconditioning one is a better choice than to buy a new one. At the same time, it is possible to fix an old battery and get several more years from it. In any case, this is a simple procedure, but it may be dangerous, due to the fact the acid can be dangerous. In any case, you will have to follow the next steps.
[Video] bring your old batteries back to life instead of buying new ones1. Remove the battery and open the caps. Some batteries have rubber protection, but you can easily remove it as well. Remove all the caps and do not place them back until you are done.
2. In most cases, a battery won’t have enough distilled water and this is the main issue. In that case, add the distilled water and recharge the battery. Once again, do not place the caps back. Keep in mind that the battery must have between 13 and 14 volts when you measure it with a voltmeter.
3. If this doesn’t solve the problem, you can try a more aggressive method. You should get an acid pack and replace the acid and add new distiller water. In that case, repeat the procedure with charging and you should get a new battery.
Don’t forget that the charging battery should be between 10 and 12 hours, if you use a slow charger. On the other side, if you use a quick charger you can recharge it in less than 6 hours. It is a much better choice to measure the battery levels with a voltmeter, while charging in order to get the best results.
Keep in mind that this type of acid can be dangerous, so it isn’t a very safe procedure, but you can manage it and be completely protected if you wear goggles and gloves. The situation is the same if you are planning to completely replace the battery acid.
In some cases, if the battery cells are damaged, you won’t get the 100% capacity from the battery, as when it was new. On the other side, you will get more than 70% of the power the battery had when it was new. This is enough for most batteries, simply because it is enough power for their applications.
Learning yourself how to recondition batteries will have a positive effect on the environment and the planet in general. At the same time, you will save money and you will be able to prolong the life of your batteries. On the other side, all these procedures are very simple.
