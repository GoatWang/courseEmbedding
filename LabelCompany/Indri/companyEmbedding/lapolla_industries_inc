General Overview
Lapolla is a leading United States based manufacturer and global distributor of foam, coatings, and equipment, focused on developing and commercializing foams and coatings targeted at commercial and industrial and residential applications in the insulation and construction industries. We believe that being vertically integrated in both foam and coating systems puts Lapolla in a strong competitive position as both product lines reduce energy consumption and ultimately lead to direct savings for consumers.  Lapolla’s products address growing consumer awareness of the building envelope. The building envelope is the separation between the interior and the exterior environments of a building and serves as the outer shell to protect the indoor environment as well as to facilitate its climate. Building envelopes with increased insulation levels are becoming standard practice. Consumers are increasingly involved in the selection of green building products due to rising energy costs and the recent availability of tax credits and energy rebates.
Operating Segments
We operate our business on the basis of two reportable segments — Foam and Coatings.  The Foam segment involves producing, and in limited instances applying through subcontractors, building envelope insulation foam for interior application, and roofing systems. The Coatings segment involves producing protective elastomeric coatings and primers. Both segments include supplying equipment and related ancillary items used in application of our products.
            Foam Segment
            Our foam business involves supplying spray polyurethane foam for insulation and roofing to the construction industry. Lapolla provides open and closed cell spray polyurethane foams for insulation, as well as closed cell technology for roofing applications.
                        Principal Products and Services and Markets
                        Spray foam insulation applications consist of perimeter wall, crawl space, and attic space for commercial, industrial, and residential applications. Roofing applications consist of new and retrofit commercial, industrial, and residential applications. Open-cell spray foam technology is a cost-effective solution to improve the energy efficiency of a building. The material expands 120 times its initial volume and fills cavities of any shape providing a continuous, protective air barrier that helps to minimize air leakage and air intrusion. Open-cell foam insulation is a performance upgrade over conventional insulation that leads to energy efficiency, improved occupant comfort, a cleaner indoor environment and greater noise reduction for building/home owners. Closed-cell spray foam insulation is one of the most efficient insulating materials commercially available, with aged R-Values above 6.0 per inch. The description “closed-cell” comes from the cell structure of the finished insulation material. One cubic inch of polyurethane foam insulation contains millions of tiny plastic closed cells filled with a non-ozone depleting blowing agent. The blowing agent is captured within the cells which contributes to highly efficient insulating properties. In addition, closed-cell foam provides an inherent air barrier with low moisture vapor permeability, and excellent resistance to water. The density for closed-cell spray foam is approximately two pounds per cubic foot. The medium density foam provides sheer and racking strength to wall assemblies in building applications. The solid nature and sealing capability of closed-cell spray foam, inhibits moisture-driven elements.
The Foam segment includes revenue from The AirTight Division. The AirTight Division primarily focuses on marketing, promoting, and selling energy saving products and energy reduction services through subcontractors. The AirTight Multi-Family Energy Savings Program is a turn-key project service. This service provides energy assessments and analysis with the assistance of independent consultants, project design, regulatory assistance to facilitate potential rebates from state and utility authorities, and project management services. This energy conservation program is designed to save landlords substantial energy costs while dramatically reducing the properties’ carbon footprint and increasing the tenants’ comfort. This will increase the overall value and return on investment of the property.
            Coatings Segment
            Our coatings business involves supplying protective coatings for roofing systems for new and retrofit commercial and industrial applications to the roofing industry. Lapolla provides an economical and effective roof coating system for application over new and existing roof substrates.
                        Principal Products and Services and Markets
Spray polyurethane foam roofing consists of two components: a closed-cell polyurethane foam insulation and a protective coating. The polyurethane foam adheres to the building substrate and items that penetrate the roof surface, making it self-flashing and giving it resistance to high winds. Spray polyurethane foams also offer enhanced impact resistance. Roofs featuring spray polyurethane foam can last 20 to 30 years with minimal maintenance requirements. Spray polyurethane roofing can be applied over an existing roof without requiring the removal of the old roof. While sprayed foam can be applied to a new roof, the majority of applications involve reroofing. Spray polyurethane foam roofing is particularly suited for roofs with unusual configurations or with multiple penetrations, as the sprayed material is self-flashing. Coatings often wear or need replacement before the foam, resulting in less tear offs and reducing waste. Spray polyurethane foam roofs are also selected by architects and designers because they can be coated with compounds that enhance reflectivity. Thus, spray polyurethane foam roofs can be considered cool roofs. Additionally, spray polyurethane foam is an excellent insulator and increases the energy efficiency of a building.

Closed Cell Foam Insulation
Closed-cell spray foam insulation is one of the most efficient insulating materials commercially available, with aged R-Values above 6.0 per inch.
The description “closed-cell” comes from the cell structure of the finished insulation material. One cubic inch of polyurethane foam insulation contains millions of tiny plastic closed cells filled with Enovate® 3000, a non-ozone depleting blowing agent.
The blowing agent is captured within the cells which contributes to highly efficient insulating properties. In addition, closed-cell foam provides an inherent air barrier with low moisture vapor permeability, and excellent resistance to water. The density for closed-cell spray foam is approximately two pounds per cubic foot. The medium density foam provides sheer and racking strength to wall assemblies in building applications.

Closed-cell spray foam insulation systems, when properly installed, deliver energy savings of up to 45%.

Small imperfections in the building envelope (holes, cracks, gaps) not properly sealed will eventually lead to poor building performance or worse, moisture accumulation, allergen/pathogen growth, and very possibly structural failure. The solid nature and sealing capability of closed-cell spray foam, inhibits moisture-driven elements. Two inches of closed-cell spray polyurethane foam insulation will minimize air infiltration, exfiltration, convection, conduction and control solar driven moisture in the building envelope.

What Is Spray Foam Insulation?
  
Air moves in and out of a home through every hole, crack, and crevice. Roughly 33% of air infiltrates through walls, ceiling, and floors. Adding an advanced insulation system is necessary to achieve optimal building performance. Lapolla is that advanced insulation system.
Spray foam insulation can maximize a homeowner’s investment by sealing the building envelope to stop conditioned indoor air from escaping and prevent unconditioned air from entering a home. Air exchange in and out of a home is a leading cause of escalated energy bills. The mechanical systems that heat and cool buildings are continuously operating; reducing extreme temperature variations saves on the overuse of mechanical systems and leads to lower energy bills.

Where Does My Home Lose Energy?Superior energy efficiency mostly depends on creating a better air “seal.” Wall insulation is a significant issue in home energy savings, but there are other factors that will lower home energy efficiency. As much as 40% of energy loss is due to air infiltration. Therefore, the most effective way to improve energy efficiency and comfort in your home is to seal it with foam.

* Moisture Control – Doors and Windows: Water and moisture in the building envelope is the single, greatest threat to building durability in residential construction. In addition to causing building-durability issues, moisture can create ideal conditions for mold growth, which can dramatically impact occupant health.
* Air Leakage – Ceilings, Outer Walls Floors and Crawlspaces: Unsealed, responsible for about a third of the air leakage in a home.

Let’s Compare The Most Popular Home Insulation Products

Insulation StandardsSpray Foam InsulationFiberglass InsulationCellulose InsulationHow Does It Work?
Spray polyurethane foam acts as a barrier between the home and outside, creating a seal that can conform to any architectural design

Traps air inside tiny glass fibers that contain small bubbles of air, which slows the transfer of heat.

Made of shredded newspaper and a fire retardant chemical (borate), the paper is broken down into cellular fibers.
Keep conditioned air and heat sealed inside your home:YesNoNoInstallation Method:
Sprayed by a certified spray foam applicator, spray foam can adapt to any structural design.

Folded, wrapped and cut to place in walls. Slanted and/or high ceilings and outlets can lengthen installation time.

Cellulose insulation is blown into walls. The material requires small amounts of water and glue to keep it in place.
R-Value:
6-6.6 per inch
2.2 per inch; loses up to R-Value 50% if it becomes damp
3.5-3.8 per inchPerformance in Cold/Hot:
Excellent thermal properties and a sealant for your home that keeps warm and conditioned air in your home year round.

Doesn’t hold in heat well. Loses 40% of insulating capacity when outside temperatures are below 20° F

Doesn’t stop air leakage by sealing. Weather will cause wind and air pressure to enter through the small holes in the insulation.
Energy Efficiency:
Most efficientLess Efficient
Less Efficient for your keeping your home insulated, even though it’s made from recycled newspaper
Health Hazards:
Polyurethane spray foam insulation consists of diisocyanate, which isn’t scientifically detectable after 1 hour of when the foam ins applied. Installing spray foam requires a professional certification and proper equipment to install it.

Fiberglass can be installed by anyone. Due to its long process for insulating around electrical outlets and windows, often insulation isn’t completed properly. Leaky ducts can pull loose fiberglass insulation and spread its particles throughout your home. Its small particles can be inhaled and cause serious respiratory conditions. The resin that bonds fiberglass can also emit small amounts of toxic fumes.

Not sealing your home means dirt and moisture can cause mold, mildew and bacteria to grow. Blown cellulose insulation is prone to create dust that is then blown through cracks in the walls and creates a health hazard.


What Kind Of Home Insulation Solutions Do You Provide?We offer two types of home insulation solutions:
Retrofit Insulation
Re-insulating part, or all, of your home. Through our energy assessment, we present to you the parts of your home that require the most insulation to decrease your energy loss. Usually this involves adding spray foam insulation to your attic, crawl space(s) and/or walls.
You can also retrofit part of your home that has never had insulation. We’ll assess these areas and provide a spray foam insulation estimate to maintain a low energy use. Occasionally homeowners need a wall, ceiling or flooring insulated to prevent drafts.
New Home Insulation
Have a new home being built, or have construction already in progress? Request for a spray foam estimate once the foundation and frame have been completed. Our insulators can provide an estimate at this level of construction.

Home Energy AssessmentContact us today! Our insulators can provide a swift response at all phases of construction, whether you’re at the conceptual phase or if construction is already underway.
A home energy assessment helps owners determine where their house is losing energy and money – and how such problems can be corrected to make the home more energy efficient. The estimate will include checking for air leaks, examining insulation, inspecting the furnace and duct work, performing a blower door test and using an infrared camera.

AgriculturalAirTight SprayFoam can be used in all sorts of agricultural applications. When unwanted air movement and thermal resistance are concerns, AirTight SprayFoam is the material of choice. Here are a few examples of common agricultural applications:
How Spray Foam Insulation is Helping U.S. Farmers Produce Better Poultry
Spray Foam insulation is certainly no stranger to the agricultural industry. For many years, spray foam has helped farmers create better climate controlled storage facilities, barns, coolers, and tanks; among other things. Recently, there has been a trend in the poultry industry to abandon the old methodology of “open air” side wall designed houses and move toward totally enclosed houses. This is big news for us in the spray foam industry because there isn’t a more cost effective, time saving or money saving option available for farmers when it comes to retrofitting their existing poultry houses.
Poultry Industry Opportunity
It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 poultry houses in the United States today, as reported by Auburn University’s Poultry Science Department. The majority of these houses were originally constructed without solid side walls. This design concept was intended to give farmers the ability to control air flow and sunlight with the use of a plastic curtain material that could be raised and lowered accordingly. The biggest problem with this type of design is that it is terribly inefficient. There is very little insulation value and virtually no way to prevent unwanted air, moisture, and temperature extremes from affecting the performance of the house. Some serious problems that occur with curtain sided houses are:

30-50% greater fuel costs in winter
Excess litter caking due to condensation
Increased heat gain in summer


Residential ApplicationsAn environmentally friendly home is a great benefit for builders, occupants, and the environment. Take an active role in helping reduce greenhouse gases, thus slowing the effects of global warming. By properly sealing a home the amount of oil that is needed to produce electricity and the carbon admitted into the environment is greatly reduced. Spray polyurethane foam insulation, because of its efficacy as an air sealer and waterproofing agent, has the potential to be a key component of the durability management strategy for a home. In addition to adding durability, spray foam contributes to projects’ achievement of high levels of energy efficiency because of the high R-value per inch and the performance characteristics of foam.

Lapolla Industries Inc. announced that its core building envelope products have been approved by the U.S. General Services Administration for inclusion in GSA Advantage. The program provides contractors with access to government-approved high-performance products for use in the construction of government buildings of all types, both domestically and abroad.
 
“We are extremely pleased to be able to widen access to our sustainable building products for government facilities,” said Doug Kramer, President and CEO of Lapolla Industries. “We look forward to growing our participation in this vital and expansive sector of the construction industry.”
 
As part of the prestigious GSA approval, numerous products of Lapolla’s core building envelope materials line are now available for purchase through GSA Advantage. These include Lapolla’s stand-out spray polyurethane products: FOAM-LOK 2000-4G, the next-generation closed-cell spray polyurethane foam insulation system, the first product of its kind globally to protect the ozone and reduce global warming impacts; FOAM-LOK 500, a new and improved open-cell spray polyurethane foam system offering high yield benefits to contractors; and FOAM-LOK 2800-4G, a rigid closed-cell spray polyurethane foam roofing system that may be applied over most new or retrofit roofing substrates and that, like FOAM-LOK 2000-4G, protects the ozone and reduces global warming impacts.
 
Additional Lapolla products which have been GSA approved include: RCS 5001, a powerful restoration coating system utilized to protect and extend the life of a roof; and cutting-edge equipment facilitating proper and efficient installation of Lapolla’s products.
 
“All of Lapolla’s products are designed for durability, and to enhance the performance and energy efficiency of structures,” added Kramer. “With this GSA approval, more and more people will be able to reap the benefits Lapolla products provide, with one of the key ones being significant energy cost savings.”

Visit the Roof Products  page for usage tips and buying guidelines.


            Although there are inherent benefits in the use of reflective roofing, before selecting a roofing product based 
            on expected energy savings consumers should explore the expected calculated results that can be found on the Department 
            of Energy's "Roof Savings Calculator" website at www.roofcalc.com. Please remember the Energy Savings that can be achieved 
            with reflective roofing is highly dependent on facility design, insulation used, climatic conditions, building location, 
            and building envelope efficiency.

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions.

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

Captain Brian Collins

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

            Manager
        





            Steve has been active in the polyurethane insulation business since late in 1999.

He worked his way up to the position of operations manager during his 9  1/2 year tenure with the VT based company.  Steve was involved in many commercial and residential projects that utilized Closed and Open cell spray and injected foams all over the east coast. Steve found himself involved in projects such as the Guggenheim Museum, Kennett High School, and the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, Harvard Law School, B&M Baked Beans and many other projects.  Steve's practical experience in the field helped him immensely in his position with Demilec USA and as Northeastern US territory manager for Lapolla Industries.
