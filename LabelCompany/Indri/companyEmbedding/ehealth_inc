eHealth, Inc. Debuts a New Resource to Help Consumers Review and Apply for Quality Life Insurance Coverage MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., January 18, 2010 – Today, eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH), parent company of eHealthInsurance, the leading online source of  health insurance for individuals, families, and small businesses, announced the launch of its new life insurance product offering, through http://www.ehealthinsurance.com and directly at www.elifeinsurance.com, which allows consumers to research and comparison shop for life insurance.   eHealth’s new offering will allow consumers to conduct side-by-side comparisons of quotes and life insurance policy benefits.   Through a referral partnership with Seattle-based Efinancial, LLC, eHealth is able to launch its life insurance offering with a broad offering of products from leading life insurance providers, with A.M. Best credit ratings ranging from “A-” to “A+.” The new life insurance offering from eHealth gives consumers access to several types of life insurance policies including traditionally underwritten policies, which require a medical review; guaranteed issue policies, which are available without a medical review or health questionnaire; and simplified issue policies, which can be applied for and approved online in a single online session by answering a few basic health questions.  eHealth also provides phone support, with access to Efinancial’s licensed agents who are qualified and able to answer any life insurance policy-related questions.    “We have been reviewing different online products to offer to our existing and new health insurance customers, and we believe that high quality and affordable term life insurance is a perfect fit,” said Bruce Telkamp, eHealth, Inc.’s Executive Vice President of Business and Corporate Development.  “Although we have sold life insurance coverage for several years as a “rider” to major medical health insurance, offering term life insurance on a standalone basis is new for us, and it’s an exciting expansion to our product portfolio.   Over the next several quarters we’ll continue to expand the integration of life insurance products into our platform.”  About eHealth, Inc.eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) is the parent company of eHealthInsurance, the nation's leading online source of health insurance for individuals, families and small businesses. Through the company's website, http://www.eHealthInsurance.com, consumers can get quotes from leading health insurance carriers, compare plans side by side, and apply for and purchase health insurance. eHealthInsurance offers thousands of health plans underwritten by more than 180 of the nation's leading health insurance companies. eHealthInsurance is licensed to sell health insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, making it a functioning national health insurance exchange.

These include statements regarding consumer’s ability to compare life insurance quotes and benefits on eHealth’s offering and the expansion of the integration of life insurance products into eHealth’s platform.  These forward-looking statements are inherently subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made, including risks associated with user demand for a source of life insurance products on eHealth’s platform, user experience on the eHealth platform, the performance, reliability and availability of the platform, the resources devoted to marketing the availability of life insurance information on the platform, the success of eHealth’s relationship with Efinancial, and the effectiveness of Efinancial in servicing life insurance referrals from eHealth’s platform.  eHealth may determine not to expand the integration of life insurance into its platform from a referral relationship to acting as a broker of record on sales of life insurance policies to platform users.  Additional factors that could cause results to differ from the forward looking statement in this release are described in eHealth's most recent periodic report as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the investor relations page of eHealth's website at www.ehealthinsurance.com and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov. eHealth does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in expectations.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
