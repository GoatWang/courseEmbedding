Somsak Chivavibul


Executive Vice President and Chief Decision Management Officer
"We've gone through many fundamental changes, and we are stronger in the process. We will continue to expand into other areas and leverage our services and skills to make us a stronger company."









Growing up outside Washington, D.C., Somsak Chivavibul got a job working at a golf course, where he sold and collected range balls at the driving range. The experience taught him two important lessons.
First, he discovered how to run a small business operation. Second, working at a golf course exposed him to many successful people.
One of those people was a certified public accountant who owned his own accounting firm. Somsak leveraged that relationship to a part-time job at the accounting firm during college.
Since those days, Somsak became a CPA himself and eventually became Navient’s first chief financial officer.
Today, as Chief Decision Management Officer, Somsak focuses on leveraging the company’s data assets, infrastructure and talent to provide insights to enhance business strategy, performance and value for customers and shareholders.
Somsak was 9 years old when his parents, who worked for the Thai embassy, moved to the United States for a four-year assignment. They liked the education system so much that they decided to stay so their three children could go to school here.
His father had an accounting background, and a high school class encouraged Somsak to pursue the field in college. He is, he says, a "logical and analytical thinker."
"My parents were both hard workers; they instilled that work ethic in me, and it's helped me throughout my career."
After graduating from University of Maryland in 1988, Somsak worked at Ernst & Young before transitioning to a new job at Sallie Mae in 1992 in the financial planning and analysis group.
"As an accountant, I was always looking at historical financial information and this new position allowed me to anticipate the future—what is going to happen instead of what happened," says Somsak. "That aspect of the job really appealed to me."
Change was a constant theme, and Somsak was involved with many significant developments from the privatization of Sallie Mae from its government-sponsored enterprise status to the 2014 spin-off of Navient. In the process, Somsak developed extensive experience in business and transaction modeling, corporate and portfolio acquisitions, financial analysis and management reporting. From 2014 to 2017, Somsak served as Navient’s CFO.
In his new role, which began in March 2017, Somsak is harnessing the power of data to answer key questions that can optimize success for our customers and the company.
When he's not spending time with his wife and daughter, he still relishes time on the golf course, either savoring the peaceful landscape by himself or spending time with friends. "You choose the environment," he says.
In both his professional and personal life, he enjoys bringing different personalities together to work as a team.
"You get everyone on the same page. At Navient, every day is different. There are today's challenges and tomorrow's challenges."

Signs for push-out forces
After almost three years on the job
Laud and praise for Chivavibul
Chris Lown taking over 
Chivavibul will remain as chief decision management officer at Navient

(management-change.com) — Wilmington, Delaware, February 21, 2017 — This news came the day after Presidents Day. Somsak Chivavibul, finance chief of Navient, leaves the position. It is a change at short notice. As announced by Navient Corporation in a news release and in a regulatory filing published on Tuesday, February 21, 2017, Somsak Chivavibul leaves the post as chief financial officer at the asset management and business processing services firm in a surprising move after almost three years on the job, effective March 27, 2017.
Chivavibul’s duties are taken over by Chris Lown, most recently investment banker at Morgan Stanley.
The fact that Chivavibul’s successor is brought in from outside suggests that the board may seek to stimulate change with fresh ideas and new initiatives.
In general, an outsider doesn’t have the constraints of an insider when it comes to leading painful changes or making unpopular decisions.
No reason given
In the announcement, Navient did not explicitly explain the reason for Chivavibul’s imminent move, leaving room for speculation.
Chivavibul will remain as chief decision management officer at Navient
“Chivavibul, current CFO, will spearhead the launch of a new enterprise-wide decision management center,” Navient said.
Chivavibul will assume his new role as the company’s executive vice president and chief decision management officer on March 27.
Reporting to the CEO, Chivavibul will focus on further leveraging the company’s data assets, infrastructure and talent to provide insights to enhance business strategy, performance, and value for customers and shareholders.
Chaired by William M. Diefenderfer III
Navient Corporation is chaired by William M. Diefenderfer III.
William M. Diefenderfer III is a partner of Diefenderfer, Hoover, Boyle & Wood in Pittsburgh, Pa., since 1991. He was previously a member of the Sallie Mae Board of Directors and played an integral role in the creation of Navient.
CEO: Jack Remondi
John (Jack) F. Remondi serves as CEO of Navient Corporation. Remondi has been the Chief Executive Officer and President of Navient Corporation since April 2014.
On the job as CFO since 2014
Somsak Chivavibul has been the Chief Financial Officer at Navient Corporation since April 2014.
After graduating in 1988, Somsak started working for Ernst & Young.
Sallie Mae was one of the firm’s audit clients, and a job at Sallie Mae in the financial planning and analysis group piqued his interest.
He started at Sallie Mae in 1992 and worked his way up from analyst to senior vice president of financial planning and analysis in 2007.
Change has been a constant theme at Sallie Mae and Somsak was involved with many of most important events at Sallie Mae from the privatization of Sallie Mae from its government sponsored enterprise status to the recent spin-off of Navient from Sallie Mae.
In the process, Somsak developed extensive experience in business and transaction modeling, corporate and portfolio acquisitions, financial analysis and management reporting.
