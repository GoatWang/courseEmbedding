Jackie Marie Clegg is the wife of U.S. Senator Christopher John Dodd (D-CT), who she married in 1999. [1]
She is currently a director of Blockbuster, a position she took up in July 2003. A biographical note states that she "serves as Managing Partner of Clegg International Consultants, LLC, an international strategic consulting firm she founded in September 2001, specializing in emerging markets." [2] She is also a director of CBOT Holdings Inc., the Chicago Board of Trade, a position she was appointed to in September 2003. She was appointed to a further three-year term on March 10, 2004. [3] (pdf)
She is also a director of Brookdale Senior Living Inc., Cardiome Pharma Corp. and Javelin Pharmaceuticals Inc. [[4]
As Director of Blockbuster, Bloomberg reported in 2005 that according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings that Clegg was paid $50,000, half in cash and half in stock. Dodd said that Cleeg had hired an attorney to review her business dealing to avoid conflict of interest problems. "We're sensitive to it," stated. "If something comes up -- we check." [5]
Bloomberg also reported that in 2004 Clegg earned director's fees from Blockbuster, the Chicago Board of Trade, Cardiome Pharma Corp., Innovative Drug Delivery Systems, Inc. and IPC Holdings, Ltd. [6]

In her role with the Export-Import Bank, Ms. Clegg had direct supervisory responsibilities for the financial operations of the Export-Import Bank and was responsible for financing more than $50 billion in U.S. exports and a portfolio of $65 billion, budgeting decisions for the Export-Import Bank's operational and program budgets and opening Export-Import Bank programs in several countries. Ms. Clegg also served as chair of the Loan and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors and as chair of the Budget Task Force and the Technology and Pricing Committees of the Export-Import Bank. Ms. Clegg had previously served as the Chief of Staff and Special Assistant to the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank from April 1993 through June 1997. Prior to her Export-Import Bank service, Ms. Clegg worked in the U.S. Senate, focusing on international finance and monetary policy, national security and foreign affairs.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
