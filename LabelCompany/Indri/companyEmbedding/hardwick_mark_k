Top Honoree, Public Companies

	When the economy went south in 2008, the executive management team at First Merchants Corp.—central Indiana’s largest financial services holding company, with a presence in 24 Indiana counties and two in Ohio—decided to do some very personal handholding with the firm’s roughly 1,200 employees.

	Instead of sending written memos about the company’s condition, they delivered the news in-person via “town hall meetings.” CFO Mark K. Hardwick was present for all of them.

	“We aggressively leaned into the challenges before us and took immediate actions that were difficult, but provided a framework for long-term success and corporate health,” Hardwick said.

Age: 41
Family: wife Cathy; daughter Halie, 14;
son Bryce, 9
Hometown: Dunkirk, Ind.
Education: bachelor’s degree in
accounting and MBA from Ball State
University; CPA; graduated from Stonier
Graduate School of Banking in 2001
Civic Involvement: President of
the Delaware County Country Club;
member of the Union Chapel United
Methodist Church finance committee;
supports United Way, First Choice for
Women, The Community Foundation,
The Youth Opportunity Center, and Ball
State athletics
Hobbies: Supporting children’s athletic
endeavors; cycling, golf, the occasional
mini-marathon (with his wife)


	“Our commitment to our highest-performing employees, proven processes, and stakeholder communications were keys to success as we emerged from the challenges of the Great Recession as a much stronger company.”

	Belt tightening and keeping a careful eye on the books didn’t just help Hardwick’s bank weather hard times. It also positioned it to reap rewards. In 2012 First Merchants seems set to establish a new record for total net income, which stood at $31.4 million through the first three quarters. Hardwick has overseen First Merchants’ books since 1997, when he signed on as corporate controller. Since then, the bank has grown from managing assets of roughly $1 billion to more than $4.2 billion, while the number of employees and locations has more than tripled. First Merchants, with Hardwick’s considerable input, also acquired Shelby County Bank last February.

	“Our risk management practices afford us the confidence to feel that we are prepared for whatever the future brings,” Hardwick said. “First Merchants expects to press forward and provide its customers with a service-driven alternative to the super-regional bank competitors in Indiana and Ohio, regardless of macro economic conditions.”

	Hardwick has been instrumental in his company’s slow-but-steady accumulation of assets. In 2010 he brokered a strategy in which the bank’s preferred stock was exchanged for trust preferred securities, resulting in an after-tax gain of roughly $10 million. Besides creating a pile of cash, the move also added several strong institutional bank stock investors to First Merchants’ shareholder base. And in 2011 Hardwick was instrumental both in raising $21.2 million in a direct private placement of the bank’s common stock, and repaying the company’s TARP obligation in full.

	To improve First Merchants’ efficiency, Hardwick also helped consolidate all affiliate bank charters into Merchants’ single remaining full-service bank charter. Though the task was handled with minimal disruption to customers, the heavy lifting required to execute the project wasn’t too different in scale and complexity from that of a bank acquisition.

	Such work is essential in an industry where the rule “go big or go home” is in full force. During the past 20 years the number of US banks has shrunk from roughly 15,200 to 7,500, with the largest 100 increasing their market share from 30 percent to 80 percent. So for Hardwick and First Merchants, the writing is on the wall: grow or die.

	“Our industry is one that truly captures financial economies of scale so we anticipate consolidation to continue,” Hardwick said. “We expect to accelerate our growth both organically and through acquisition. We are planning to excel despite increasing regulatory requirements, like Dodd-Frank and Basel III’s increasing capital standards, to mention a couple.”

	First Merchants’ chairman of the board Charles R. Schalliol said that one of Hardwick’s biggest challenges is guiding the company through the tougher post-financial-meltdown regulatory thicket. “The responsibility is significant and ever-changing in producing a safe and sound environment,” Schalliol said. “With Mark at the helm, First Merchants has increased its stock price nearly 250 percent in the last 36 months.”

	Nevertheless Hardwick expects 2013 to be another challenging year, with national GDP in the 1 to 3 percent range. A lot depends on US economic policies and whether the European Union can get its tottering financial house in order. But whatever comes, he’s confident the bank can handle it.•

Light Bulb - 40W

							PartSelect Number PS884734


							Manufacturer Part Number 8009              


							This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part.

Flat Style Oven Igniter Kit

							PartSelect Number PS1573892


							Manufacturer Part Number 12400035


							The flat style oven igniter kit is used in gas ovens and ranges. It is what provides the heat needed to open the gas valve, and it ignites fuel for the burner assembly. This part can be used for both bake and broil elements, and it can replace both short and long igniters. However, it cannot replace round style oven igniters. If your igniter glows for 90 seconds or more without igniting the burner, this means it is too weak to open the valve. The element in your igniter may have shorted it and it might not glow at all, or it might only glow orange or red. It needs to glow white hot; if it cannot get hot enough the gas will not be released from the safety valve and it will be impossible to light the burner in your oven. This kit includes the igniter, ceramic wire nuts, an insulation pad, a metal bracket, a variety of plug ends, and an instruction sheet. The body length is 3 3/4 inches, and the element inside is approximately 1 1/2 inches. This replacement part has an amperage range of 3.3 to 3.6. The element inside this igniter is extremely fragile, do not touch it. Before you start repairing your oven or range, make sure you have unplugged it and shut off the gas supply.

2 Piece Broiler Pan

							PartSelect Number PS971245


							Manufacturer Part Number 4396923           


							This is cookware designed for use in your range or oven. It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.

Light Bulb - 40W

							PartSelect Number PS1156014


							Manufacturer Part Number 8206443           


							The 40W lightbulb is found in the interior of your microwave, which will need to be replaced if you have noticed the light is no longer coming on after opening the door. The light bulb is clear in color and made of glass. For this installation, you will need a Phillips screw driver and utility knife. Before beginning, make sure to disconnect the power and wait a few minutes. Remove the two screws in the grove vent and set aside and then lift the grill vent forward and pull up to remove. The light bulb should be underneath a panel and may require the use of your utility knife to remove the silicone holding it in place. Line the new bulb up with the socket and screw into place until it is snug.

SEAL- DOOR

							PartSelect Number PS11743943

							This oven door seal creates a protective seal around an oven door to prevent heat from running out of a closed oven and keeps room air from entering the oven.

Remove screws  to take off old seal using pliers and replace it with the new seal. For detailed installation instructions and accurate guidance, refer to the diagram provided by the manufacturer.

Oven Door Spring

							PartSelect Number PS11744749


							Manufacturer Part Number WP7803P058-60


							The oven door springs create tension which allows the door to open and close with ease. This spring can be used on either the left or right side of your oven, is made completely of metal, and is approximately 6 inches long. If your oven door will not open or close easily, you may need to replace this part. It may be a good idea to replace both hinges at the same time, because if a spring has become loose, the other hinge is likely to have the same issue. You may need to remove the side panel of the oven to reach where the spring attaches, so make sure the oven is off and is cool to the touch. This part is sold individually.

Chrome Drip Bowl - 8"

							PartSelect Number PS11750107


							Manufacturer Part Number WPW10196405


							This drip bowl is also known as a drip pan, and it is designed for use with cooktops and ranges. It sits below 8-inch burner elements, and catches drips and spills from the cookware on the burner. The diameter of the drip bowl is approximately 9 3/4 inches.

Simply remove the burner element, remove the old bowl, line the hole on the new bowl up with the terminal block and drop it into place. Make sure the bowl is flat before reinstalling the element. While you have the element out you should inspect the terminals for corrosion, damage, or discoloration. If you notice any of those things you should also replace the element and terminal block.

Surface Burner Plug-In Block Kit

							PartSelect Number PS340571


							Manufacturer Part Number 330031            


							The surface burner plug-in block kit features a newer-style terminal block. This kit is designed for use with ranges and cooktops. This terminal block is how the coil element on your stove connects to the inner wiring of your appliance. Without this connection your burner element would not get the electrical current it needs to heat up. When your element will not heat at all, or if it is not heating properly it is likely an issue with the terminal block. You need to remove the element to replace this part. While you have the element out, inspect the element and the terminal for any corrosion, arcing, or discoloration. If you notice any damage to the element or the terminals we recommend you replace this part as well. This kit includes two metal brackets, two pre-crimped high-temperature wire leads, two ceramic wire nuts, two heat-shrinking insulators, and a mounting screw. Before you begin this repair, make sure you have unplugged your appliance.

							PartSelect Number PS884734


							Manufacturer Part Number 8009              


							This an authentic OEM 40-Watt replacement light bulb, used in a number of household appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part.

Temperature Sensor

							PartSelect Number PS304103


							Manufacturer Part Number WR55X10025        


							This temperature sensor, also known as a thermistor, is used for refrigerators and freezers. The sensor sends the temperature reading of the refrigerator towards the control board.

Before replacing the temperature sensor, make sure to unplug the fridge for safety. The tools needed for this repair are a nut driver, wire crimper, and wire splice connectors.

Thermal Fuse

							PartSelect Number PS11741460


							Manufacturer Part Number WP3392519


							This thermal fuse is designed for use in dryers. It is a safety mechanism that stops the flow of electricity to the heating element when a dryer overheats. When this fuse is faulty, your dryer will not start or it will not heat properly. This is a one-time fuse, meaning it cannot be re-set. It must be replaced when there is no longer continuity between the terminals. This replacement part features two 3/16 inch terminals, and is sold individually. It attaches to the blower wheel housing. Blown fuses can be caused by clogged dryer vents. We recommend checking to make sure all of the vents are clear when you perform this repair.

							PartSelect Number PS755842


							Manufacturer Part Number WE1M504

Lower Door Closing Cam

							PartSelect Number PS11739042
