The Boston Beer Company began in 1984 with a generations-old family recipe that Founder and Brewer Jim Koch uncovered in his father’s attic and brought to life in his kitchen. That beer was aptly named Samuel Adams Boston Lager, in recognition of one of our nation's great founding fathers, a man of independent mind and spirit. Little did Jim know at the time, Samuel Adams Boston Lager would soon become a catalyst of the American craft beer revolution.
Today, at Boston Beer, we brew more than 60 styles of Samuel Adams beer. We relentlessly pursue the development of new styles and the perfection of classic beers by searching the world for the finest ingredients. We remain focused on brewing quality beer and challenging drinkers’ perceptions of what beer can be through the use of innovative ingredients and brewing techniques. We are committed to elevating the image of American craft beer and are one of the world’s most award-winning breweries at international beer competitions. Although Samuel Adams beer is one of America's largest-selling craft beer, it accounts for only about one percent of the U.S. beer market.
The Boston Beer Company will continue its independently-minded quest to brew great beer and to advocate for the growth of craft beer across America. In addition to Samuel Adams beers and the other craft beers brewed by A&S Brewing, our craft beer incubator, our family of brands include Twisted Tea and Angry Orchard hard cider. For more information, please visit wwww.samueladams.com, www.angryorchard.com, and www.twistedtea.com.

Samuel Adams
BOSTON LAGER
With his great-great grandfather Louis Koch’s beer recipe in hand, Jim brewed the very first batch of Samuel Adams Boston Lager in his kitchen. When it was introduced in 1984, Samuel Adams Boston Lager was a complex and full-bodied craft beer in a world of thin, light-bodied mass marketed beers. After more than 30 years, this beer is still our favorite and sets the standard for all of our brews.

Samuel Adams
BOSTON LAGER
With his great-great grandfather Louis Koch’s beer recipe in hand, Jim brewed the very first batch of Samuel Adams Boston Lager in his kitchen. When it was introduced in 1984, Samuel Adams Boston Lager was a complex and full-bodied craft beer in a world of thin, light-bodied mass marketed beers. After more than 30 years, this beer is still our favorite and sets the standard for all of our brews.

The beers in our first ever Brewing the American Dream Variety Pack were brewed in collaboration with five rising-stars who participate in Brewing the American Dream. These breweries each have a story as unique as their beers, and we are excited to share them with you. We’ve also included Boston Lager, since this was the beer that started it all for us.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Boston Beer Company ca. 1880


The Boston Beer Company was founded in 1984 by James "Jim" Koch and Rhonda Kallman.[8] The initial beer offering was Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a 4.8% abv amber or Vienna lager.[9] Koch, the sixth-generation, first-born son to follow in his family's brewing footsteps, brewed his first batch of the beer in his kitchen, using the original family recipe for Louis Koch Lager.[10] At the time, Koch was working at Boston Consulting Group after receiving BA, MBA and JD degrees from Harvard University. While serving in his role as a manufacturing consultant at BCG, Koch developed a business plan for a locally focused beer company. He invested $100,000 of his own money and raised additional funds from investors, family members, and friends including former classmates and BCG colleagues.[1][8] The company was organized as a limited liability partnership; most early investors did not have active roles in the company.[11] However, one early investor, John B. Wing, held a board seat until 2002.[12]
Koch named his beer after the Boston patriot Samuel Adams, who fought for American independence, and who also had inherited a brewing tradition from his father.[13] In March 1985, Koch introduced the beer as Samuel Adams Boston Lager, over Patriot's Day weekend which honors the first battle of the American Revolution and today is more widely known for the running of the Boston Marathon. Six weeks later, Samuel Adams was voted "Best Beer in America" at the Great American Beer Festival,[1] in which 93 national and regional beers competed. The beer was first put on tap at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain.[14]
Initially, Koch rented excess capacity and brewed the beer at the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, best known for their Iron City brand of beer. As sales increased Koch developed other contract arrangements at various brewing facilities with excess capacity, ranging from Stroh breweries, Portland's original Blitz-Weinhard brewery (shuttered in 1999), Cincinnati's Hudepohl-Schoenling brewery (eventually purchased by the Boston Beer Company in early 1997), and industry giant SABMiller. The Boston Beer Company also has a small R&D brewery located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, where public tours and beer tastings are offered. The brewery occupies part of the premises of the old Haffenreffer Brewery.[15][16]
1990s – present[edit]
In 1997, Jim Koch returned to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, where his father apprenticed in the 1940s. This was also an important step the company took to reduce reliance on contract brewing.[17]




Brew kettles at the Samuel Adams Boston Brewery


The company's success occurred in conjunction with the U.S. craft beer movement. By 1995, some 500 independent breweries were producing specialty beers in the United States. That year, The Boston Beer Company went public, selling shares of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol, "SAM". These shares, however, have no voting rights, while the company is controlled through its Class B Common Stock, of which Koch owns 100% of the shares.[18]
Boston Beer launched Hardcore Cider in 1997, and Twisted Tea brand in 2000. In 2007, the Boston Beer Company purchased the former F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company brewery in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley.[19][20] The brewery had been owned by Diageo North America, Inc. and used for the production of Smirnoff Ice malt beverages since 2001.[20] By 2012, Samuel Adams was producing two-thirds of all its beer at the Breinigsville facility, and it has increased brewing capacity there.[20] In 2012 Boston Beer Company launched Angry Orchard hard cider company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[21]
As of 2014, the company had 1,325 employees in its Boston, Massachusetts, Cincinnati, Ohio and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania breweries.[3][5]
Products[edit]

Samuel Adams Boston Lager

Following Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.[22]

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA

First brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India Pale Ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo.[23] In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale.

Sam Adams Light

Introduced in 2001, Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. The company previously sold Boston Lightship, which was introduced in 1993.[24]

Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection

These Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood.[25] The beers in this collection are American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.[26]

Samuel Adams Utopias





A Samuel Adams Utopias beer bottle


The company followed this up in 2002 with Utopias; at 24% ABV, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new "vintages" of Utopias annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% ABV by 2007.
Utopias is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released.[27][28] Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of Utopias cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.
Because of legal restrictions, Utopias is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.[29]

Triple Bock

Triple Bock was released in 1994, 1995, and 1997. It has a black, opaque color, no carbonation, and at 17.5% ABV it was the strongest beer brewed at the time it was introduced.[30] Maple syrup was added in the brewing process. Triple Bock was a "forerunner" of later strong beers from Samuel Adams — Millennium (21% ABV released in 1999 only), and Utopias (24–26% ABV first released in 2002).

Seasonal beers

In addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has four seasonal offerings. The spring seasonal beers are Cold Snap, a Witbier and Escape Route, a Kölsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale and Porch Rocker, a radler. The Autumn seasonal beers are available August through October and are Octoberfest, a Marzen and Pumpkin Batch, a saison with pumpkin. The Winter/Holiday seasonal beers are available November through December and are, Winter Lager, a Bock and White Christmas an Ale.[31]
Samuel Adams also offers seasonal variety packs that include a mix of year-round and seasonal offerings.[31][32]

Hard cider

Samuel Adams began offering ciders in 1995. The company has both year-round and seasonal cider offerings.[33]
Weihenstephan partnership[edit]
In October 2009, the Boston Beer Company announced a two-year project with German brewery Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan to jointly produce a new craft beer named Infinium, to be marketed in both Germany and the U.S. The brewers describe the beer, which was sold in corked bottles and has alcohol content of 10.3% abv, as a Champagne-like "crisp pale brew".[34] Approximately 15,000 cases were released in North America in December 2010 at a suggested retail price of $20 per 750 mL bottle,[35] Marketed towards drinkers who would rather toast with beer than Champagne on New Year's Eve, Infinium is described by the brewers as "the first new beer style created under the Reinheitsgebot in over a hundred years."[34][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream[edit]
In 2008, Jim Koch created the Brewing the American Dream program.[37] As of 2015, the company has helped more than 4,000 entrepreneurs and together with their lending partner, Accion, made close to 400 loans totaling $400 million.[37]
2008 hops shortage[edit]
In early 2008, amidst a worldwide shortage of hops—a key ingredient in beer—Boston Beer Company agreed to sell 20,000 pounds of its hops, at cost, to craft brewers throughout the United States. The company selected 108 craft brewers to divide the 20,000 pounds they had spare.[38][39]
Samuel Adams shared their hops again in June 2012.[38]
LongShot American Homebrew Competition[edit]
Created in 1996, the Samuel Adams LongShot American Homebrew Competition is an annual competition among amateur homebrewers.

Since 1990, the company has produced a seasonal fruit beer labeled "Cranberry Lambic". "Lambic" describes a spontaneously fermented beer generally produced in Brussels or the nearby Pajottenland region,[41] and the Samuel Adams product is not spontaneously fermented, consumers and brewers charged that "Cranberry Lambic" was mislabeled[42] and could cause consumer confusion (Michael Jackson, a leading beer critic, called it "a misleading name".[43]) Grant Wood, Senior Brewing Manager at Boston Beer, defended the name, saying, "I wouldn't consider it mislabeling. Whenever I have served the Cranberry Lambic, I have always been really up front about it. Is it a true lambic made in that region in Belgium? No. Does it taste like one? Yes. So it's sort of our homage to the style without the pain and agony of it."[42]
During 2000–2002, the company sponsored a radio show on WNEW in New York called "Opie & Anthony." The hosts created a promotion called "Sex for Sam", in which Opie and Anthony encouraged couples to have sex in notable public places in New York City. On August 15, 2002, a Virginia couple was charged with public lewdness after attempting to have sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral; this led to the firing of the radio hosts a week later.
In October 2007, in an incident referred to by the Wall Street Journal as "Sam Adams v. Sam Adams,"[44] the Boston Beer Company demanded that control of the domain names "samadamsformayor.com" and "mayorsamadams.com" be turned over to the company.[45] The domains had been purchased by an employee of the Portland, Oregon radio station NewsRadio 1190 KEX for the campaign of Portland mayoral candidate, Sam Adams. In a cease-and-desist letter,[45] the company expressed concern that consumers might confuse the mayoral candidate with their beer. In an interview with the Associated Press the company said it was willing to discuss Adams' use of his name on his Web sites, "probably for the length of the time the election is being held."[46]
In April 2008, the Boston Beer Company issued its first recall, because of potential defects found in certain 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) glass bottles manufactured by a third-party supplier which supplies about a quarter of the bottles the Boston Beer Company uses. The Boston Beer Company stated that they believed fewer than 1% of bottles from the supplier could contain small pieces of glass and issued a recall for the safety of consumers. There were no reports of injuries.[47] News of the recall led to shares of the company temporarily dropping by over 3%.[48]
On July 4, 2013, a video commercial for Sam Adams beer was rolled out on the July 4th holiday that created controversy over an omitted phrase. The manufacturer decided to leave out "endowed by their creator" in its invocation of the Declaration of Independence which outraged critics. But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement: "The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, 'Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.' We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines."[49]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Boston Beer Company ca. 1880


The Boston Beer Company was founded in 1984 by James "Jim" Koch and Rhonda Kallman.[8] The initial beer offering was Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a 4.8% abv amber or Vienna lager.[9] Koch, the sixth-generation, first-born son to follow in his family's brewing footsteps, brewed his first batch of the beer in his kitchen, using the original family recipe for Louis Koch Lager.[10] At the time, Koch was working at Boston Consulting Group after receiving BA, MBA and JD degrees from Harvard University. While serving in his role as a manufacturing consultant at BCG, Koch developed a business plan for a locally focused beer company. He invested $100,000 of his own money and raised additional funds from investors, family members, and friends including former classmates and BCG colleagues.[1][8] The company was organized as a limited liability partnership; most early investors did not have active roles in the company.[11] However, one early investor, John B. Wing, held a board seat until 2002.[12]
Koch named his beer after the Boston patriot Samuel Adams, who fought for American independence, and who also had inherited a brewing tradition from his father.[13] In March 1985, Koch introduced the beer as Samuel Adams Boston Lager, over Patriot's Day weekend which honors the first battle of the American Revolution and today is more widely known for the running of the Boston Marathon. Six weeks later, Samuel Adams was voted "Best Beer in America" at the Great American Beer Festival,[1] in which 93 national and regional beers competed. The beer was first put on tap at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain.[14]
Initially, Koch rented excess capacity and brewed the beer at the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, best known for their Iron City brand of beer. As sales increased Koch developed other contract arrangements at various brewing facilities with excess capacity, ranging from Stroh breweries, Portland's original Blitz-Weinhard brewery (shuttered in 1999), Cincinnati's Hudepohl-Schoenling brewery (eventually purchased by the Boston Beer Company in early 1997), and industry giant SABMiller. The Boston Beer Company also has a small R&D brewery located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, where public tours and beer tastings are offered. The brewery occupies part of the premises of the old Haffenreffer Brewery.[15][16]
1990s – present[edit]
In 1997, Jim Koch returned to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, where his father apprenticed in the 1940s. This was also an important step the company took to reduce reliance on contract brewing.[17]




Brew kettles at the Samuel Adams Boston Brewery


The company's success occurred in conjunction with the U.S. craft beer movement. By 1995, some 500 independent breweries were producing specialty beers in the United States. That year, The Boston Beer Company went public, selling shares of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol, "SAM". These shares, however, have no voting rights, while the company is controlled through its Class B Common Stock, of which Koch owns 100% of the shares.[18]
Boston Beer launched Hardcore Cider in 1997, and Twisted Tea brand in 2000. In 2007, the Boston Beer Company purchased the former F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company brewery in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley.[19][20] The brewery had been owned by Diageo North America, Inc. and used for the production of Smirnoff Ice malt beverages since 2001.[20] By 2012, Samuel Adams was producing two-thirds of all its beer at the Breinigsville facility, and it has increased brewing capacity there.[20] In 2012 Boston Beer Company launched Angry Orchard hard cider company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[21]
As of 2014, the company had 1,325 employees in its Boston, Massachusetts, Cincinnati, Ohio and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania breweries.[3][5]
Products[edit]

Samuel Adams Boston Lager

Following Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.[22]

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA

First brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India Pale Ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo.[23] In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale.

Sam Adams Light

Introduced in 2001, Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. The company previously sold Boston Lightship, which was introduced in 1993.[24]

Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection

These Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood.[25] The beers in this collection are American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.[26]

Samuel Adams Utopias





A Samuel Adams Utopias beer bottle


The company followed this up in 2002 with Utopias; at 24% ABV, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new "vintages" of Utopias annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% ABV by 2007.
Utopias is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released.[27][28] Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of Utopias cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.
Because of legal restrictions, Utopias is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.[29]

Triple Bock

Triple Bock was released in 1994, 1995, and 1997. It has a black, opaque color, no carbonation, and at 17.5% ABV it was the strongest beer brewed at the time it was introduced.[30] Maple syrup was added in the brewing process. Triple Bock was a "forerunner" of later strong beers from Samuel Adams — Millennium (21% ABV released in 1999 only), and Utopias (24–26% ABV first released in 2002).

Seasonal beers

In addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has four seasonal offerings. The spring seasonal beers are Cold Snap, a Witbier and Escape Route, a Kölsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale and Porch Rocker, a radler. The Autumn seasonal beers are available August through October and are Octoberfest, a Marzen and Pumpkin Batch, a saison with pumpkin. The Winter/Holiday seasonal beers are available November through December and are, Winter Lager, a Bock and White Christmas an Ale.[31]
Samuel Adams also offers seasonal variety packs that include a mix of year-round and seasonal offerings.[31][32]

Hard cider

Samuel Adams began offering ciders in 1995. The company has both year-round and seasonal cider offerings.[33]
Weihenstephan partnership[edit]
In October 2009, the Boston Beer Company announced a two-year project with German brewery Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan to jointly produce a new craft beer named Infinium, to be marketed in both Germany and the U.S. The brewers describe the beer, which was sold in corked bottles and has alcohol content of 10.3% abv, as a Champagne-like "crisp pale brew".[34] Approximately 15,000 cases were released in North America in December 2010 at a suggested retail price of $20 per 750 mL bottle,[35] Marketed towards drinkers who would rather toast with beer than Champagne on New Year's Eve, Infinium is described by the brewers as "the first new beer style created under the Reinheitsgebot in over a hundred years."[34][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream[edit]
In 2008, Jim Koch created the Brewing the American Dream program.[37] As of 2015, the company has helped more than 4,000 entrepreneurs and together with their lending partner, Accion, made close to 400 loans totaling $400 million.[37]
2008 hops shortage[edit]
In early 2008, amidst a worldwide shortage of hops—a key ingredient in beer—Boston Beer Company agreed to sell 20,000 pounds of its hops, at cost, to craft brewers throughout the United States. The company selected 108 craft brewers to divide the 20,000 pounds they had spare.[38][39]
Samuel Adams shared their hops again in June 2012.[38]
LongShot American Homebrew Competition[edit]
Created in 1996, the Samuel Adams LongShot American Homebrew Competition is an annual competition among amateur homebrewers. Homebrewers submit their brew to a series of judging and taste tests with the chance to see their creation in larger-scale production and sold on store shelves as part of a Samuel Adams mixed 6-pack the following year.[40]

But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement: "The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, 'Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.' We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines."[49]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Boston Beer Company ca. 1880


The Boston Beer Company was founded in 1984 by James "Jim" Koch and Rhonda Kallman.[8] The initial beer offering was Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a 4.8% abv amber or Vienna lager.[9] Koch, the sixth-generation, first-born son to follow in his family's brewing footsteps, brewed his first batch of the beer in his kitchen, using the original family recipe for Louis Koch Lager.[10] At the time, Koch was working at Boston Consulting Group after receiving BA, MBA and JD degrees from Harvard University. While serving in his role as a manufacturing consultant at BCG, Koch developed a business plan for a locally focused beer company. He invested $100,000 of his own money and raised additional funds from investors, family members, and friends including former classmates and BCG colleagues.[1][8] The company was organized as a limited liability partnership; most early investors did not have active roles in the company.[11] However, one early investor, John B. Wing, held a board seat until 2002.[12]
Koch named his beer after the Boston patriot Samuel Adams, who fought for American independence, and who also had inherited a brewing tradition from his father.[13] In March 1985, Koch introduced the beer as Samuel Adams Boston Lager, over Patriot's Day weekend which honors the first battle of the American Revolution and today is more widely known for the running of the Boston Marathon. Six weeks later, Samuel Adams was voted "Best Beer in America" at the Great American Beer Festival,[1] in which 93 national and regional beers competed. The beer was first put on tap at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain.[14]
Initially, Koch rented excess capacity and brewed the beer at the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, best known for their Iron City brand of beer. As sales increased Koch developed other contract arrangements at various brewing facilities with excess capacity, ranging from Stroh breweries, Portland's original Blitz-Weinhard brewery (shuttered in 1999), Cincinnati's Hudepohl-Schoenling brewery (eventually purchased by the Boston Beer Company in early 1997), and industry giant SABMiller. The Boston Beer Company also has a small R&D brewery located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, where public tours and beer tastings are offered. The brewery occupies part of the premises of the old Haffenreffer Brewery.[15][16]
1990s – present[edit]
In 1997, Jim Koch returned to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, where his father apprenticed in the 1940s. This was also an important step the company took to reduce reliance on contract brewing.[17]




Brew kettles at the Samuel Adams Boston Brewery


The company's success occurred in conjunction with the U.S. craft beer movement. By 1995, some 500 independent breweries were producing specialty beers in the United States. That year, The Boston Beer Company went public, selling shares of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol, "SAM". These shares, however, have no voting rights, while the company is controlled through its Class B Common Stock, of which Koch owns 100% of the shares.[18]
Boston Beer launched Hardcore Cider in 1997, and Twisted Tea brand in 2000. In 2007, the Boston Beer Company purchased the former F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company brewery in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley.[19][20] The brewery had been owned by Diageo North America, Inc. and used for the production of Smirnoff Ice malt beverages since 2001.[20] By 2012, Samuel Adams was producing two-thirds of all its beer at the Breinigsville facility, and it has increased brewing capacity there.[20] In 2012 Boston Beer Company launched Angry Orchard hard cider company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[21]
As of 2014, the company had 1,325 employees in its Boston, Massachusetts, Cincinnati, Ohio and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania breweries.[3][5]
Products[edit]
See also: Samuel Adams (beer)

Samuel Adams Boston Lager

Following Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.[22]

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA

First brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India Pale Ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo.[23] In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale.

Sam Adams Light

Introduced in 2001, Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. The company previously sold Boston Lightship, which was introduced in 1993.[24]

Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection

These Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood.[25] The beers in this collection are American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.[26]

Samuel Adams Utopias





A Samuel Adams Utopias beer bottle


The company followed this up in 2002 with Utopias; at 24% ABV, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new "vintages" of Utopias annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% ABV by 2007.
Utopias is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released.[27][28] Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of Utopias cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.
Because of legal restrictions, Utopias is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.[29]

Triple Bock

Triple Bock was released in 1994, 1995, and 1997. It has a black, opaque color, no carbonation, and at 17.5% ABV it was the strongest beer brewed at the time it was introduced.[30] Maple syrup was added in the brewing process. Triple Bock was a "forerunner" of later strong beers from Samuel Adams — Millennium (21% ABV released in 1999 only), and Utopias (24–26% ABV first released in 2002).

Seasonal beers

In addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has four seasonal offerings. The spring seasonal beers are Cold Snap, a Witbier and Escape Route, a Kölsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale and Porch Rocker, a radler. The Autumn seasonal beers are available August through October and are Octoberfest, a Marzen and Pumpkin Batch, a saison with pumpkin. The Winter/Holiday seasonal beers are available November through December and are, Winter Lager, a Bock and White Christmas an Ale.[31]
Samuel Adams also offers seasonal variety packs that include a mix of year-round and seasonal offerings.[31][32]

Hard cider

Samuel Adams began offering ciders in 1995. The company has both year-round and seasonal cider offerings.[33]
Weihenstephan partnership[edit]
In October 2009, the Boston Beer Company announced a two-year project with German brewery Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan to jointly produce a new craft beer named Infinium, to be marketed in both Germany and the U.S. The brewers describe the beer, which was sold in corked bottles and has alcohol content of 10.3% abv, as a Champagne-like "crisp pale brew".[34] Approximately 15,000 cases were released in North America in December 2010 at a suggested retail price of $20 per 750 mL bottle,[35] Marketed towards drinkers who would rather toast with beer than Champagne on New Year's Eve, Infinium is described by the brewers as "the first new beer style created under the Reinheitsgebot in over a hundred years."[34][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream[edit]
In 2008, Jim Koch created the Brewing the American Dream program.[37] As of 2015, the company has helped more than 4,000 entrepreneurs and together with their lending partner, Accion, made close to 400 loans totaling $400 million.[37]
2008 hops shortage[edit]
In early 2008, amidst a worldwide shortage of hops—a key ingredient in beer—Boston Beer Company agreed to sell 20,000 pounds of its hops, at cost, to craft brewers throughout the United States. The company selected 108 craft brewers to divide the 20,000 pounds they had spare.[38][39]
Samuel Adams shared their hops again in June 2012.[38]
LongShot American Homebrew Competition[edit]
Created in 1996, the Samuel Adams LongShot American Homebrew Competition is an annual competition among amateur homebrewers. Homebrewers submit their brew to a series of judging and taste tests with the chance to see their creation in larger-scale production and sold on store shelves as part of a Samuel Adams mixed 6-pack the following year.[40]
Controversies[edit]





This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. (December 2014)


Since 1990, the company has produced a seasonal fruit beer labeled "Cranberry Lambic". "Lambic" describes a spontaneously fermented beer generally produced in Brussels or the nearby Pajottenland region,[41] and the Samuel Adams product is not spontaneously fermented, consumers and brewers charged that "Cranberry Lambic" was mislabeled[42] and could cause consumer confusion (Michael Jackson, a leading beer critic, called it "a misleading name".[43]) Grant Wood, Senior Brewing Manager at Boston Beer, defended the name, saying, "I wouldn't consider it mislabeling. Whenever I have served the Cranberry Lambic, I have always been really up front about it. Is it a true lambic made in that region in Belgium? No. Does it taste like one? Yes. So it's sort of our homage to the style without the pain and agony of it."[42]
During 2000–2002, the company sponsored a radio show on WNEW in New York called "Opie & Anthony." The hosts created a promotion called "Sex for Sam", in which Opie and Anthony encouraged couples to have sex in notable public places in New York City. On August 15, 2002, a Virginia couple was charged with public lewdness after attempting to have sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral; this led to the firing of the radio hosts a week later.
In October 2007, in an incident referred to by the Wall Street Journal as "Sam Adams v. Sam Adams,"[44] the Boston Beer Company demanded that control of the domain names "samadamsformayor.com" and "mayorsamadams.com" be turned over to the company.[45] The domains had been purchased by an employee of the Portland, Oregon radio station NewsRadio 1190 KEX for the campaign of Portland mayoral candidate, Sam Adams. In a cease-and-desist letter,[45] the company expressed concern that consumers might confuse the mayoral candidate with their beer. In an interview with the Associated Press the company said it was willing to discuss Adams' use of his name on his Web sites, "probably for the length of the time the election is being held."[46]
In April 2008, the Boston Beer Company issued its first recall, because of potential defects found in certain 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) glass bottles manufactured by a third-party supplier which supplies about a quarter of the bottles the Boston Beer Company uses. The Boston Beer Company stated that they believed fewer than 1% of bottles from the supplier could contain small pieces of glass and issued a recall for the safety of consumers. There were no reports of injuries.[47] News of the recall led to shares of the company temporarily dropping by over 3%.[48]
On July 4, 2013, a video commercial for Sam Adams beer was rolled out on the July 4th holiday that created controversy over an omitted phrase. The manufacturer decided to leave out "endowed by their creator" in its invocation of the Declaration of Independence which outraged critics. But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement: "The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, 'Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.' We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines."[49]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Boston Beer Company ca. 1880


The Boston Beer Company was founded in 1984 by James "Jim" Koch and Rhonda Kallman.[8] The initial beer offering was Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a 4.8% abv amber or Vienna lager.[9] Koch, the sixth-generation, first-born son to follow in his family's brewing footsteps, brewed his first batch of the beer in his kitchen, using the original family recipe for Louis Koch Lager.[10] At the time, Koch was working at Boston Consulting Group after receiving BA, MBA and JD degrees from Harvard University. While serving in his role as a manufacturing consultant at BCG, Koch developed a business plan for a locally focused beer company. He invested $100,000 of his own money and raised additional funds from investors, family members, and friends including former classmates and BCG colleagues.[1][8] The company was organized as a limited liability partnership; most early investors did not have active roles in the company.[11] However, one early investor, John B. Wing, held a board seat until 2002.[12]
Koch named his beer after the Boston patriot Samuel Adams, who fought for American independence, and who also had inherited a brewing tradition from his father.[13] In March 1985, Koch introduced the beer as Samuel Adams Boston Lager, over Patriot's Day weekend which honors the first battle of the American Revolution and today is more widely known for the running of the Boston Marathon. Six weeks later, Samuel Adams was voted "Best Beer in America" at the Great American Beer Festival,[1] in which 93 national and regional beers competed. The beer was first put on tap at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain.[14]
Initially, Koch rented excess capacity and brewed the beer at the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, best known for their Iron City brand of beer. As sales increased Koch developed other contract arrangements at various brewing facilities with excess capacity, ranging from Stroh breweries, Portland's original Blitz-Weinhard brewery (shuttered in 1999), Cincinnati's Hudepohl-Schoenling brewery (eventually purchased by the Boston Beer Company in early 1997), and industry giant SABMiller. The Boston Beer Company also has a small R&D brewery located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, where public tours and beer tastings are offered. The brewery occupies part of the premises of the old Haffenreffer Brewery.[15][16]
1990s – present[edit]
In 1997, Jim Koch returned to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, where his father apprenticed in the 1940s. This was also an important step the company took to reduce reliance on contract brewing.[17]




Brew kettles at the Samuel Adams Boston Brewery


The company's success occurred in conjunction with the U.S. craft beer movement. By 1995, some 500 independent breweries were producing specialty beers in the United States. That year, The Boston Beer Company went public, selling shares of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol, "SAM". These shares, however, have no voting rights, while the company is controlled through its Class B Common Stock, of which Koch owns 100% of the shares.[18]
Boston Beer launched Hardcore Cider in 1997, and Twisted Tea brand in 2000. In 2007, the Boston Beer Company purchased the former F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company brewery in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley.[19][20] The brewery had been owned by Diageo North America, Inc. and used for the production of Smirnoff Ice malt beverages since 2001.[20] By 2012, Samuel Adams was producing two-thirds of all its beer at the Breinigsville facility, and it has increased brewing capacity there.[20] In 2012 Boston Beer Company launched Angry Orchard hard cider company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[21]
As of 2014, the company had 1,325 employees in its Boston, Massachusetts, Cincinnati, Ohio and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania breweries.[3][5]
Products[edit]

Samuel Adams Boston Lager

Following Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.[22]

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA

First brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India Pale Ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo.[23] In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale.

Sam Adams Light

Introduced in 2001, Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. The company previously sold Boston Lightship, which was introduced in 1993.[24]

Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection

These Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood.[25] The beers in this collection are American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.[26]

Samuel Adams Utopias





A Samuel Adams Utopias beer bottle


The company followed this up in 2002 with Utopias; at 24% ABV, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new "vintages" of Utopias annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% ABV by 2007.
Utopias is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released.[27][28] Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of Utopias cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.
Because of legal restrictions, Utopias is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.[29]

Triple Bock

Triple Bock was released in 1994, 1995, and 1997. It has a black, opaque color, no carbonation, and at 17.5% ABV it was the strongest beer brewed at the time it was introduced.[30] Maple syrup was added in the brewing process. Triple Bock was a "forerunner" of later strong beers from Samuel Adams — Millennium (21% ABV released in 1999 only), and Utopias (24–26% ABV first released in 2002).

Seasonal beers

In addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has four seasonal offerings. The spring seasonal beers are Cold Snap, a Witbier and Escape Route, a Kölsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale and Porch Rocker, a radler. The Autumn seasonal beers are available August through October and are Octoberfest, a Marzen and Pumpkin Batch, a saison with pumpkin. The Winter/Holiday seasonal beers are available November through December and are, Winter Lager, a Bock and White Christmas an Ale.[31]
Samuel Adams also offers seasonal variety packs that include a mix of year-round and seasonal offerings.[31][32]

Hard cider

Samuel Adams began offering ciders in 1995. The company has both year-round and seasonal cider offerings.[33]
Weihenstephan partnership[edit]
In October 2009, the Boston Beer Company announced a two-year project with German brewery Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan to jointly produce a new craft beer named Infinium, to be marketed in both Germany and the U.S. The brewers describe the beer, which was sold in corked bottles and has alcohol content of 10.3% abv, as a Champagne-like "crisp pale brew".[34] Approximately 15,000 cases were released in North America in December 2010 at a suggested retail price of $20 per 750 mL bottle,[35] Marketed towards drinkers who would rather toast with beer than Champagne on New Year's Eve, Infinium is described by the brewers as "the first new beer style created under the Reinheitsgebot in over a hundred years."[34][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream[edit]
In 2008, Jim Koch created the Brewing the American Dream program.[37] As of 2015, the company has helped more than 4,000 entrepreneurs and together with their lending partner, Accion, made close to 400 loans totaling $400 million.[37]
2008 hops shortage[edit]
In early 2008, amidst a worldwide shortage of hops—a key ingredient in beer—Boston Beer Company agreed to sell 20,000 pounds of its hops, at cost, to craft brewers throughout the United States. The company selected 108 craft brewers to divide the 20,000 pounds they had spare.[38][39]
Samuel Adams shared their hops again in June 2012.[38]
LongShot American Homebrew Competition[edit]
Created in 1996, the Samuel Adams LongShot American Homebrew Competition is an annual competition among amateur homebrewers. Homebrewers submit their brew to a series of judging and taste tests with the chance to see their creation in larger-scale production and sold on store shelves as part of a Samuel Adams mixed 6-pack the following year.[40]
Controversies[edit]





This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. (December 2014)


Since 1990, the company has produced a seasonal fruit beer labeled "Cranberry Lambic". "Lambic" describes a spontaneously fermented beer generally produced in Brussels or the nearby Pajottenland region,[41] and the Samuel Adams product is not spontaneously fermented, consumers and brewers charged that "Cranberry Lambic" was mislabeled[42] and could cause consumer confusion (Michael Jackson, a leading beer critic, called it "a misleading name".[43]) Grant Wood, Senior Brewing Manager at Boston Beer, defended the name, saying, "I wouldn't consider it mislabeling. Whenever I have served the Cranberry Lambic, I have always been really up front about it. Is it a true lambic made in that region in Belgium? No. Does it taste like one? Yes. So it's sort of our homage to the style without the pain and agony of it."[42]
During 2000–2002, the company sponsored a radio show on WNEW in New York called "Opie & Anthony." The hosts created a promotion called "Sex for Sam", in which Opie and Anthony encouraged couples to have sex in notable public places in New York City. On August 15, 2002, a Virginia couple was charged with public lewdness after attempting to have sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral; this led to the firing of the radio hosts a week later.
In October 2007, in an incident referred to by the Wall Street Journal as "Sam Adams v. Sam Adams,"[44] the Boston Beer Company demanded that control of the domain names "samadamsformayor.com" and "mayorsamadams.com" be turned over to the company.[45] The domains had been purchased by an employee of the Portland, Oregon radio station NewsRadio 1190 KEX for the campaign of Portland mayoral candidate, Sam Adams. In a cease-and-desist letter,[45] the company expressed concern that consumers might confuse the mayoral candidate with their beer. In an interview with the Associated Press the company said it was willing to discuss Adams' use of his name on his Web sites, "probably for the length of the time the election is being held."[46]
In April 2008, the Boston Beer Company issued its first recall, because of potential defects found in certain 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) glass bottles manufactured by a third-party supplier which supplies about a quarter of the bottles the Boston Beer Company uses. The Boston Beer Company stated that they believed fewer than 1% of bottles from the supplier could contain small pieces of glass and issued a recall for the safety of consumers. There were no reports of injuries.[47] News of the recall led to shares of the company temporarily dropping by over 3%.[48]
On July 4, 2013, a video commercial for Sam Adams beer was rolled out on the July 4th holiday that created controversy over an omitted phrase. The manufacturer decided to leave out "endowed by their creator" in its invocation of the Declaration of Independence which outraged critics. But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement: "The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, 'Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.' We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines."[49]

Controversies[edit]

Since 1990, the company has produced a seasonal fruit beer labeled "Cranberry Lambic". "Lambic" describes a spontaneously fermented beer generally produced in Brussels or the nearby Pajottenland region,[41] and the Samuel Adams product is not spontaneously fermented, consumers and brewers charged that "Cranberry Lambic" was mislabeled[42] and could cause consumer confusion (Michael Jackson, a leading beer critic, called it "a misleading name".[43]) Grant Wood, Senior Brewing Manager at Boston Beer, defended the name, saying, "I wouldn't consider it mislabeling. Whenever I have served the Cranberry Lambic, I have always been really up front about it. Is it a true lambic made in that region in Belgium? No. Does it taste like one? Yes. So it's sort of our homage to the style without the pain and agony of it."[42]
During 2000–2002, the company sponsored a radio show on WNEW in New York called "Opie & Anthony." The hosts created a promotion called "Sex for Sam", in which Opie and Anthony encouraged couples to have sex in notable public places in New York City. On August 15, 2002, a Virginia couple was charged with public lewdness after attempting to have sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral; this led to the firing of the radio hosts a week later.
In October 2007, in an incident referred to by the Wall Street Journal as "Sam Adams v. Sam Adams,"[44] the Boston Beer Company demanded that control of the domain names "samadamsformayor.com" and "mayorsamadams.com" be turned over to the company.[45] The domains had been purchased by an employee of the Portland, Oregon radio station NewsRadio 1190 KEX for the campaign of Portland mayoral candidate, Sam Adams. In a cease-and-desist letter,[45] the company expressed concern that consumers might confuse the mayoral candidate with their beer. In an interview with the Associated Press the company said it was willing to discuss Adams' use of his name on his Web sites, "probably for the length of the time the election is being held."[46]
In April 2008, the Boston Beer Company issued its first recall, because of potential defects found in certain 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) glass bottles manufactured by a third-party supplier which supplies about a quarter of the bottles the Boston Beer Company uses. The Boston Beer Company stated that they believed fewer than 1% of bottles from the supplier could contain small pieces of glass and issued a recall for the safety of consumers. There were no reports of injuries.[47] News of the recall led to shares of the company temporarily dropping by over 3%.[48]
On July 4, 2013, a video commercial for Sam Adams beer was rolled out on the July 4th holiday that created controversy over an omitted phrase. The manufacturer decided to leave out "endowed by their creator" in its invocation of the Declaration of Independence which outraged critics. But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement: "The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, 'Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.' We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines."[49]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Boston Beer Company ca. 1880


The Boston Beer Company was founded in 1984 by James "Jim" Koch and Rhonda Kallman.[8] The initial beer offering was Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a 4.8% abv amber or Vienna lager.[9] Koch, the sixth-generation, first-born son to follow in his family's brewing footsteps, brewed his first batch of the beer in his kitchen, using the original family recipe for Louis Koch Lager.[10] At the time, Koch was working at Boston Consulting Group after receiving BA, MBA and JD degrees from Harvard University. While serving in his role as a manufacturing consultant at BCG, Koch developed a business plan for a locally focused beer company. He invested $100,000 of his own money and raised additional funds from investors, family members, and friends including former classmates and BCG colleagues.[1][8] The company was organized as a limited liability partnership; most early investors did not have active roles in the company.[11] However, one early investor, John B. Wing, held a board seat until 2002.[12]
Koch named his beer after the Boston patriot Samuel Adams, who fought for American independence, and who also had inherited a brewing tradition from his father.[13] In March 1985, Koch introduced the beer as Samuel Adams Boston Lager, over Patriot's Day weekend which honors the first battle of the American Revolution and today is more widely known for the running of the Boston Marathon. Six weeks later, Samuel Adams was voted "Best Beer in America" at the Great American Beer Festival,[1] in which 93 national and regional beers competed. The beer was first put on tap at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain.[14]
Initially, Koch rented excess capacity and brewed the beer at the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, best known for their Iron City brand of beer. As sales increased Koch developed other contract arrangements at various brewing facilities with excess capacity, ranging from Stroh breweries, Portland's original Blitz-Weinhard brewery (shuttered in 1999), Cincinnati's Hudepohl-Schoenling brewery (eventually purchased by the Boston Beer Company in early 1997), and industry giant SABMiller. The Boston Beer Company also has a small R&D brewery located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, where public tours and beer tastings are offered. The brewery occupies part of the premises of the old Haffenreffer Brewery.[15][16]
1990s – present[edit]
In 1997, Jim Koch returned to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, where his father apprenticed in the 1940s. This was also an important step the company took to reduce reliance on contract brewing.[17]




Brew kettles at the Samuel Adams Boston Brewery


The company's success occurred in conjunction with the U.S. craft beer movement. By 1995, some 500 independent breweries were producing specialty beers in the United States. That year, The Boston Beer Company went public, selling shares of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol, "SAM". These shares, however, have no voting rights, while the company is controlled through its Class B Common Stock, of which Koch owns 100% of the shares.[18]
Boston Beer launched Hardcore Cider in 1997, and Twisted Tea brand in 2000. In 2007, the Boston Beer Company purchased the former F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company brewery in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley.[19][20] The brewery had been owned by Diageo North America, Inc. and used for the production of Smirnoff Ice malt beverages since 2001.[20] By 2012, Samuel Adams was producing two-thirds of all its beer at the Breinigsville facility, and it has increased brewing capacity there.[20] In 2012 Boston Beer Company launched Angry Orchard hard cider company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[21]
As of 2014, the company had 1,325 employees in its Boston, Massachusetts, Cincinnati, Ohio and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania breweries.[3][5]

On August 15, 2002, a Virginia couple was charged with public lewdness after attempting to have sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral; this led to the firing of the radio hosts a week later.
In October 2007, in an incident referred to by the Wall Street Journal as "Sam Adams v. Sam Adams,"[44] the Boston Beer Company demanded that control of the domain names "samadamsformayor.com" and "mayorsamadams.com" be turned over to the company.[45] The domains had been purchased by an employee of the Portland, Oregon radio station NewsRadio 1190 KEX for the campaign of Portland mayoral candidate, Sam Adams. In a cease-and-desist letter,[45] the company expressed concern that consumers might confuse the mayoral candidate with their beer. In an interview with the Associated Press the company said it was willing to discuss Adams' use of his name on his Web sites, "probably for the length of the time the election is being held."[46]
In April 2008, the Boston Beer Company issued its first recall, because of potential defects found in certain 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) glass bottles manufactured by a third-party supplier which supplies about a quarter of the bottles the Boston Beer Company uses. The Boston Beer Company stated that they believed fewer than 1% of bottles from the supplier could contain small pieces of glass and issued a recall for the safety of consumers. There were no reports of injuries.[47] News of the recall led to shares of the company temporarily dropping by over 3%.[48]
On July 4, 2013, a video commercial for Sam Adams beer was rolled out on the July 4th holiday that created controversy over an omitted phrase. The manufacturer decided to leave out "endowed by their creator" in its invocation of the Declaration of Independence which outraged critics. But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement: "The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, 'Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.' We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines."[49]

Boston Beer: Excellent Business Model And Management - Boston Beer Co. (NYSE:SAM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Boston Beer: Excellent Business Model And ManagementMay.22.13 | About: Boston Beer (SAM) Nikhil Raheja Long/short equityThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) is one of the best small companies in the US. It gains this distinction due to a better portfolio of products than have most of its competitors. The company maintains this edge through intense innovation and newer lines of beers. As long as the company can maintain that effort, it would remain a good investment for the long term.
Important Factors for Analysis:
Business Model:
Boston Beer's business strategy is built around crafting high quality beer. The company invests heavily in research and testing to create newer brews. Case in point is a new research and development center it started in 2011. The product at Boston Beer is well distinguished and is very popular among beer lovers.
Boston Beer is the largest craft brewer in the United States. It sells its beers under the Samuel Adams brand. In 2012, the company sold over 50 kinds of beers under the Sam Adams product line.
Samuel Adams is consistently listed among the best beers in the world. The beers under this brand are made from hand selected ingredients that give the beer more dimensions and make it balanced and rich. The Sam Adams beer is known for its appearance, aroma, taste and finish. Such high quality has been achieved since the start of the company. For instance, six weeks after the introduction of the Sam Adams beer, Jim Koch (the co-founder) entered Sam Adams into the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, and it was chosen as America's best beer.
Boston Beer is constantly innovating and creating newer products. "The Company continually test brews different beers and occasionally sells them under various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest." Boston Brewery spends a majority of its time "ideating, testing and developing beers and ciders," and is consequently, a leading innovator in its segment of products. In 2011, the company formed Alchemy & Science, a subsidiary that finds new opportunities in craft brewing. Alchemy & Science looks for unique brewing techniques and ingredients, and also hunts for ancient or new recipes to develop new beer. Due to Boston Beer's efforts and innovations, and its success at gaining customer loyalty, the company made it to Forbes magazine's "Best Small Companies" list in 2012. It ranked 26th in the country.

Management:
James Koch is the Chairman of Boston Beer and co-founded the company in 1984. Koch is the company's greatest asset. He is an ardent beer enthusiast, and is in the business of selling a product he loves. Despite achieving enormous success, Koch has remained intimately involved with the brewing process. For instance, Koch would taste every batch produced by the company. Koch continues to do plenty of interviews with magazines and other analysts, always reminding people of the superiority of the company's beers.
The story of Jim Koch is no different from John Mackey's or Howard Schultz's. All of them built companies around products they loved and admired. It would be fair to say that Jim Koch is the Howard Schultz of beer.
Cash Reserves:
At the end of 2012, the company's current ratio was close to 2. Its quick ratio was very healthy, at 1.32. The company has done a good job of managing its working capital and should not have any liquidity problems in the near future.
The company has little or no long term debt. Also, it has an ROA of 18.78%. This is an additional boon for investors. Boston Beer has been able to grow without much leverage and is in a good position to grow through all phases of the economic cycle.
This investment would certainly appeal to long term investors since they always prefer a good balance sheet.
Major Risks:
Boston Beer's success is based on a unique product. Its beers are different from the run-of-the-mill beers due to their aroma, texture and taste. To succeed, the company must continue to follow this established path of product differentiation. The biggest risk faced by Boston Beer is an internal one. It is that the company would stop innovating and rest on its laurels.
Stock Price:
Understandably, the company has a very high PE ratio of 35.39. This is due to very high earnings estimates for the near future. Those estimates may or may not materialize in the short term, however, the stock remains a good purchase for the long term. Long term investors would do well to purchase this stock using dollar cost averaging.

Conclusion:
Boston Beer is a "Buy" for the long term investors. The company has all the right ingredients for success: the right management, a well distinguished product, and a good balance sheet. Unless there is an adverse change in the management, or the business model, the company would stay on course for greater earnings and fame.

Publication Date: April 14, 1996

 Capital markets may have overcapitalized the craft brewing industry during a flurry of new IPOs. In the context of this "hot" IPO market each individual company's valuation may seem reasonable. However, after careful analysis of each company's financial statement and upon consideration of analysts' forecasts of the industry's growth prospects, it is unclear whether the craft brewing industry is overcapitalized. This could be another "hot" then "crash" IPO industry, like biotech or the computer disk drive industry.

Constellation Brands, Boston Beer shares slide after Goldman Sachs downgrades
Shares of Constellation Brands Inc.  slid 1.2% Monday, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral, while shares of Boston Beer Co. Inc.  fell 5% after Goldman downgraded that stock tosell, citing concerns about slowing U.S. beer volumes. Nielsen data is signaling a 0.6% decline for the first half, analyst Judy Hong said in a note. "We acknowledge that some of the softness is likely due to higher volatility in the measured channel data, as well as less favorable weather patterns," Hong wrote. "However, we increasingly see broader secular challenges of 4-P's (Population, Penetration, Pricing, and Placement) putting pressure on beer volume for the foreseeable future." . Hong lowered her overall U.S. beer volume forecast for 2017 to 2018 to down 0.7% to down 0.3% versus a previous forecast of flat to up 0.1%. The analyst left shares of Molson Coors Brewing Co.  at buy, because "while we see lingering volume risk, undemanding valuation and potential for healthy free cash flow growth warrant a Buy rating with 19% upside, in our view," said the note. Constellation Brands shares have gained 13% in 2017, while Boston Beer has fallen 24% and Molson Coors has lost 9%. The S&P 500  has gained about 10% in the same period.

Constellation Brands, Boston Beer shares slide after Goldman Sachs downgrades
Shares of Constellation Brands Inc.  slid 1.2% Monday, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral, while shares of Boston Beer Co. Inc.  fell 5% after Goldman downgraded that stock tosell, citing concerns about slowing U.S. beer volumes. Nielsen data is signaling a 0.6% decline for the first half, analyst Judy Hong said in a note. "We acknowledge that some of the softness is likely due to higher volatility in the measured channel data, as well as less favorable weather patterns," Hong wrote. "However, we increasingly see broader secular challenges of 4-P's (Population, Penetration, Pricing, and Placement) putting pressure on beer volume for the foreseeable future." . Hong lowered her overall U.S. beer volume forecast for 2017 to 2018 to down 0.7% to down 0.3% versus a previous forecast of flat to up 0.1%. The analyst left shares of Molson Coors Brewing Co.  at buy, because "while we see lingering volume risk, undemanding valuation and potential for healthy free cash flow growth warrant a Buy rating with 19% upside, in our view," said the note. Constellation Brands shares have gained 13% in 2017, while Boston Beer has fallen 24% and Molson Coors has lost 9%. The S&P 500  has gained about 10% in the same period.

Boston Beer Co., Inc. Looks to End Its Drought
The craft brewer reports first-quarter 2016 results soon. Here's what investors should be watching.

After leaving the market thirsty for more with its fourth-quarter 2015 report in February, Boston Beer Co. (NYSE:SAM) investors sure could use a pick-me-up when the craft brewer announces first-quarter 2016 results next week. 
Boston Beer stock has fallen more than 30% over the past year, including a 12% decline so far in 2016 after Boston Beer founder Jim Koch admitted last quarter the company likely lost market share, even as overall growth within its core "better beer" and craft categories remains healthy. Primarily to blame, Boston Beer says, is increased competition as new craft brewers enter the market while existing competitors expand regional distribution. Make no mistake: That's a great thing in terms of choice for today's beer-drinking consumer. But it stifles the growth of established brewers like Boston Beer as they attempt to maintain share in this increasingly crowded segment.
So what should Boston Beer investors be watching this time around?
First, Boston Beer management hasn't provided specific financial guidance for the current quarter. They did note, however, that depletions -- a key measure for how quickly Boston Beer's products travel from warehouses to consumer outlets -- fell a worrisome 3% year over year through the first six weeks of 2016. Nonetheless, Boston Beer CEO Martin Roper insisted the company intends to strategically maintain a "high level of brand investment" as it continues to pursue sustainable growth.
A glass half fullRelatedly, keep an eye on Boston Beer's full-year guidance. As it stands, Boston Beer's most recent 2016 outlook calls for depletions and shipments growth in the mid-single-digit percent range, indicating the figure should improve as the year wears on. At the same time, Boston Beer called for 2016 ad, promo, and selling expenses between $10 million and $20 million, capital spending between $60 million and $80 million, national price increases between 1% and 2%, and gross margin between 52% and 54%.





When all is said and done -- and assuming all else remains constant -- Boston Beer says that should translate to earnings per share this year between $7.60 and $8.00, good for year-over-year growth between 4.8% and 10.3%. To be fair -- and with the caveat that we don't lend much credence to Wall Street's near-term demands -- that guidance disappointed analysts at the time, who called (on average) for higher 2016 earnings of $8.05 per share. Now, however, Wall Street has ratcheted down its expectations, with consensus estimates modeling 2016 earnings of $7.78 per share. 
Digging deeperBut it's not all about Boston Beer's bottom line. So what will actually drive these results?
This time one year ago, Boston Beer founder and Chairman Jim Koch partly credited the company's first-quarter 2015 earnings beat to the fact their spring seasonal, Samuel Adams Cold Snap, was not only "well received by drinkers, retailers, and distributors," but also segued into a smooth transition late in the quarter to its always-popular summer seasonal, Samuel Adams Summer Ale. In recent quarters, however, Boston Beer's depletions declines were led by decreases in its core Samuel Adams varieties, as well broader declines in the cider category which hurt its Angry Orchard brands.
Boston Beer also introduced several new varieties this quarter, including the introduction of its Samuel Adams Nitro Project beers -- the cans which contain a nitro widget to mimic the effect of a nitro tap on draft -- as well as the national roll out of Grapefruit IPA, and the narrower 16-state launch of its new alcohol-infused seltzer line, Truly Spiked and Sparkling. Listen for updates, then, from management on consumers' early response to these novel offerings. If Boston Beer's core beer brands continue to underperform in the near term, these new brands could offer just the edge Boston Beer needs to continue driving market-beating returns.
