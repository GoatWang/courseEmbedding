Duke Health Patient

it was a very pleasent experience

 


Duke Health Patient
 - October 2016


Excellent care.  Should I need a hematologist in the future, it will definitely be Dr. Agrawal.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - October 2016


Dr. Agrawal is awesome, we are very pleased about our experience while in his care.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - October 2016


I only saw Dr. Agrawal in consult at Wake Med once and in his office once for follow up reports on labs drawn.  His nurse practitioner in the hospital setting was very concerned and professional as was Dr. Agrawal.  Super care!!

 






Duke Health Patient
 - October 2016


Again, it has been a pleasant experience to be with first Dr. Taylor and now Dr. Agrawal and their teams.  I have the highest regard for all of them and those that they referred me.  Total Excellence is the word that describes my 6+ years with the group

 


Duke Health Patient
 - October 2016


I feel extremely fortunate to have Dr. Agrawal, his staff, and Duke personnel at each level that I visit!!!

 






Duke Health Patient
 - September 2016


The nurse drawing my blood was excellent causing little pain. The entire nursing staff was friendly and professional. The procedure of my treatment by Dr. Agrawal is working and reducing my visits for treatment. The hematology group is a pleasure to work with.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - August 2016


*Dr. Agrawal is the greatest and not only is he a great dr. he's my friend.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - July 2016


I feel extremely grateful having Dr. Agrawal, Dr. Rosenberg, and Melissa Smith (PA) on my "A-Team" to see me through my battles....also very lucky!!!

 


Duke Health Patient
 - June 2016


I always have a good visit with Dr. Agrawal and his staff. I can tell my overall health is important to him.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - May 2016


The doctors and nurses, assistants, receptionist all are excellent.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - May 2016


The receptionist, nurses, assistants, and cancer doctors are all excellent people.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - May 2016


Dr. Agrawal and his PA were very kind, honest and forth coming with all information needed at this time. Extremely happy they spoke to us with language we could understand. Yes, we hear the big words, but understand the layman terms.  Thankful we were referred by Dr. Lori Lily to this practice!

 


Duke Health Patient
 - May 2016


Dr. A is the best doctor ever!!!

 






Duke Health Patient
 - April 2016


I feel extremely lucky to have Dr. Agrawal and his assistant Melissa (my bad that I don't remember her last name) on my team.  There was a time in December that I thought I might have a serious problem and both Dr. Agrawal and Dr. Rosenberg were out of town.    My wife and I headed to Duke (without an appointment) and Melissa came to my rescue.  drove from Angier to Duke just hoping to see someone and Melissa worked us in an saved the day!!!

 


Duke Health Patient
 - April 2016


As always, I had a wonderful Doctor's appointment.  Every aspect....

 






Duke Health Patient
 - March 2016


Overall was very good experience during a difficult time

 


Duke Health Patient
 - March 2016


I always feel saisfied and cared for by Dr. Agrawal and his staff

 






Duke Health Patient
 - March 2016


EXECELLENT CARE

 


Duke Health Patient
 - March 2016


I have had a great experience and I have an excellent team taking care of me

 






Duke Health Patient
 - March 2016


THIS DR AND STAFF ARE THE BEST AND I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THE DR IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME. HE IS THE ONE I WANT FOR MY BATTLE WITH MY CANCER .

 


Duke Health Patient
 - February 2016


Dr Agrawal, his personal staff and the staff, nurses and techs in the infusion unit are the most caring and professional medical staff I have ever experienced.  I've been under their care for over 18 months fighting small cell lung cancer.  A-1, Top grade.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - February 2016


Love Dr. Agrawal and Melissa, PA...they are both terrific!  My concerns are with getting results / orders for testing.  Emails to Dr. A get no response as he does not monitor them.  Responses from RN / triage have not been timely / professional in past.  Other entities using EPIC have emails directed to MD routed to his/her nurse or PA....why can that not happen with Duke Raleigh Heme/Onc?  Prior concerns directed to Oncology Admin were never responded to either....  DCI customer service a huge disappointment compared to prior oncology / cardiology practices with which I've been involved.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - January 2016


Both Dr. Agarwal and Jane (RN Coordinator) are awesome!  They give enough time and compassion to the situation to ensure one feels taken care of and genuinely cared for.  Try to keep them around!

 






Duke Health Patient
 - January 2016


Great visit!

 


Duke Health Patient
 - January 2016


The provider gave me the information concerning my care that was sound advice and from knowledge of my test results explained thoroughly what they mean. This comforted me as to the emotions and fears I had about my condition. the staff is excellent and supportive also.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - January 2016


Unless something happens with my kidneys or liver (polycystic in both), this was my last visit with Dr. Agrawal. I was very glad that Duke hired him after his previous place shut down. He is an excellent doctor & I hope he is with you a very long time. Love the new digs!

 


Duke Health Patient
 - January 2016


Nothing but outstanding feelings about Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Agrawal, Milissa, and all connected personnel.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


Excellent treatment throughout.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


Spent several hours in the waiting room for want of chair for phlebotomy. Hope the hospital will improve providing more chairs in this facility.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


Very good!!!

 


Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


I am seeing the MD for low HGB so some of the questions are not applicable. Dr. Agrawal and Melissa,the PA are both excelent health care providers  and most recently worked hard to get my blood levels up so I could have knee replacement. They are working to get it back up lost surgery. My apponitments took much less time when he was in private practice.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


As always it was a pleasant experience. As pleasant as possible anyway considering....

 


Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


Definitely very good!!!

 






Duke Health Patient
 - December 2015


Good experience.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


This was my initial visit and I was very pleased with the compassion that was given. The first visit is very traumatic when you have no idea what is going to happen and you feel like you life will never be the same.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


The initial check in time downstairs was a little long but with reconstruction she moving of offices that's understandable.  Dr Agrawal and his nurses, including Melissa, are always very caring. I've been seeing him for 3 years and would not want to change ontologists.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE TO BE UNDER YOUR CARE. YOU HAVE EXTENDED MY LIFE SPAN WITH LEAST SUFFERING.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


OVERALL GOOD

 


Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


I am blessed to have Dr. Agrawal Neeraj as my provider, and all the wonderful staff that is a part of Duke Raleigh Cancer Center. They are Angels, and we are blessed to have them. They truly care about their patients.

 






Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


MY EXPERIENCE FOR LAST FEW YEARS IS EXTREMELY SATISFACTORY.  I AM THANKFUL TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF DUKE MEDICINE FOR THEIR GREAT HUMAN SERVICE.

 


Duke Health Patient
 - November 2015


I'm very happy with the care I receive.

Enterprise IT Engineers From Mars, Customers from Venus 
Neeraj Agrawal
July 23, 2015







 25 views 












How, as an emerging SaaS company, do you nail your business model, get your engineers to truly understand customer needs and, finally, go toe-to-toe with legacy competitors? AppDynamics* former CEO Jyoti Bansal continues his discussion on these topics and others in his “SaaS Adventure” video interview with Battery’s Neeraj Agrawal. You can view the first three segments of the discussion here.


In segment 4 (above), Bansal discusses how AppDynamics approaches the classic software “freemium” model—offering a version of a product for free, then charging for premium services. Originally, Bansal says, the company offered AppDynamics Light, a limited-functionality version of its product, free on an unlimited basis. But the company learned that customers appreciated the product more if they used the full product first.
So now, AppDynamics provides the full version free for 15 days. After that, freemium users are converted to limited-functionality version. By experiencing the full functionality and value of the product up front, Bansal describes how the company has already “done much of the selling, without anyone even talking to us.”
Segment 5: Customer-centric engineering, and breaking down barriers

Are engineers and enterprise-software customers from two different planets? They are at many tech companies, but don’t have to be, Bansal says in the next segment.
Here, Bansal discusses the importance of engineers being familiar with actual customer problems so they can build better products to help solve them. At AppDynamics, this is called “customer-centric engineering.” Engineers are encouraged to sit in on phone or video sales presentations so they can get a feel for customer needs and preferences, and learn what aspects of the AppDynamics product seem to resonate with customers the most during demos.
“Engineers are smart people,” Bansal says. “If you make it easy for them to understand the problem, they will come up with solutions. Breaking the barriers between engineers and customers is the fastest way to innovate.”
On the sales side, Bansal counsels other founders to change the type of sales leadership they encourage through various phases of their companies’ growth. Leading sales at a company with under $20 million in revenue involves different processes than running the sales department at a company with $100 million to $200 million in revenue, and certainly more than $1 billion.
Segment 6: Competitive Advantages

Here, Bansal discusses his perspective on the secret to AppDynamics competitive success—fostering startups within a startup. Bansal’s philosophy, he notes, is that small teams innovate the best: “They are more customer aligned, more innovation aligned and you don’t need to build process around them.” He shares the story about how as AppDynamics began to scale and put more processes in place, he found that the company began to slow down. This, he states, was concerning. “The reason we are out- innovating the legacy companies, who have no shortage of money, is because we are small, nimble and fast moving. If we don’t remain that, our main competitive advantage goes away.” So AppDynamics split the company into small organizations of no more than 30-35 people to function as ‘startups within a startup’.
In this segment Bansal also discusses his approach to customer success, an emerging business function designed to ensure customers gain full value from a company’s products and continue to purchase from the company year after year. “Everything you do,” Bansal advises to fellow entrepreneurs, “you should do to make your customers successful. At AppDyanmics customer success is everyone’s job within the company.” This approach has gained AppDynamics a Net Promoter Score of 84; this measure of how likely customers are to recommend the brand is higher than scores gained by much-loved consumer brands like Apple and Amazon.
Jyoti Bansal was the second guest in Agrawal’s SaaS Adventure video-interview series. In the series, Agrawal, analyzes the ins-and-outs—and ups and downs–of building a breakout software company, offering lessons for entrepreneurs.
