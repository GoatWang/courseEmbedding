The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE

Lot-to-lot consistency

Our own Aarolene® Recycled resins include over 200 grades of recycled content, colored in black and grey.  We formulate to your specifications for melt indexes, color, Izod impact, density and many other physical properties.  All are tested in-house by certified lab personnel before shipment.

One of the nation's top furniture rental and rent-to-own companies (behind industry leader Rent-A-Center), Aaron's purveys home furnishings, electronics, computers, and appliances through more than 2,040 Aaron's stores and more than 75 HomeSmart locations in the US and Canada. Its Woodhaven Furniture Industries unit makes most of the firm's furniture and bedding at more than a dozen plants in the US. Founded in 1955, Aaron's has exited the office furniture rental business to focus on household goods.

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY

First to Review
        


I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. DO NOT GO!



















This is the quality of product service that they offer at Aaron's. Be careful customers!!

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store.

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE

I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store.

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY

I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. DO NOT GO!



















This is the quality of product service that they offer at Aaron's. Be careful customers!!

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY

First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE







The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE

The quality of the furniture is ok - the price was right, so you're not going to get top quality.  If you do payments, they are due on the 1st of the month.  On the second day of the month, they start to harass you with calls up to 3 times a day.  On the 6th day, they start to call your references.  On the 9th day of the month, they hang a public notice on your door, with a check that they are contacting you about payment.  I told them to stop, and they insisted that the fair debt collection laws don't apply to them - the manager said "it's a contract, not a debt."   They finally stopped after I sent them 5 cease and desist letters, and five months of this nonsense.  Don't finance anything through this place. STAY AWAY







I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... 

When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. 

Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... 

After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. 

After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. 

On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. 

Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. 
DO NOT GO!







First things first.do not buy furniture from these guys unless you enjoy bed bugs.we bought couches from them that were on the display and they stated they were like new.we lived in our condo for 4 years and never had them.a month after getting these couches,we started seeing bed bugs.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE

First to Review
        


I purchased my bed set from this Aaron's, Inc from Sunnyvale. Thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products, I was wrong... When I thought I was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products, I was actually purchasing nasty, crawling bed bugs. I should of known, it all started from the beginning. From the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlers/drivers. They told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped. Aaron's Representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this "accident" they need to delay my delivery for another week. Keep in mind that I requested and was confirmed by Aaron's that I would have an early delivery, so I would have it in time before my move-in date. When delivering my mattress the following week, Aaron's Delivery Driver/Package Handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector. When I asked the driver, driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used. Hence, the bed bugs... After two months, I noticed more than 20 black/red spots inside the mattress protector that came from Aaron's as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector, they were all around the mattress. When contacting Aaron's at 1:06am, October 8th, 2016 by email to Markus, Sales Manager who I purchased and made an agreement for the mattress, I was upset and traumatized, I couldn't even sleep in my own bed that night. Later that day, at 9:29am, I was contacted by Aaron's Representative (Delivery Person- who delivered my products), stating to me that they received the email and that Markus was no longer with the company. He then told me that he emailed the Regional Manager- Andy and also contacted Orkin, who will contact me directly. After many calls to the store about the situation- urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room, about 12:19pm- I then spoke to Ismael- Aaron's Representative that I just needed them to take the mattress out. Ismael then told me that I will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still. I was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional. Ismael then stated that he didn't to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not. At about 2:08pm, I spoke to Ismael again and he stated that the Store Manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment. It was about 5:54pm that I contacted the store again and I was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done. Finally at 7:50pm, Store Manager Unisex- I am not sure how to spell his name, picked up the mattress and took it out of the room. He told me that Orkin, should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his Regional Manager about the situation. When telling him about the situation about Ismael stating that I will have to still make payments his response was "in order for me to not pay for the product/item, Orkin will have to make a report stating that the Bed Bugs came from the mattress not the room. On October 11th, 2016 Orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation. Orkin then called later that day stating that they couldn't make it. The Orkin Representative stated that he will be calling me the next day, Orkin did not call until the following day. Orkin Representative called back at 2:05pm Orkin Representative stated that he spoke with Andrew-Regional Manager from Aaron's Company and Andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and that's where the problem came from, that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises. Finally the Regional Manager Andy contacted me, he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress, keep in mind that the inspector from Orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isn't not infestation in the unit. He said that my agreement will be inactive and I will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system. This regional manager is a joke, completely protecting his company, saying that it didn't have to do with the mattress. He stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a V-lock mattress and that if I think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh. He is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the risk. Make sure to stop by RENT-A-CENTER in Sunnyvale, CA next to Aaron's first before coming in to this store. DO NOT GO!



















This is the quality of product service that they offer at Aaron's. Be careful customers!!
