Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the MLP ETF (Symbol: MLPA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $12.65 per unit.      With MLPA trading at a recent price near $11.02 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.78% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MLPA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Western Gas Partners LP (Symbol: WES), Buckeye Partners LP (Symbol: BPL), and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (Symbol: EPD). Although WES has traded at a recent price of $53.20/share, the average analyst target is 20.73% higher at $64.23/share. Similarly, BPL has 20.31% upside from the recent share price of $63.67 if the average analyst target price of $76.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EPD to reach a target price of $32.46/share, which is 17.27% above the recent price of $27.68. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WES, BPL, and EPD:       Combined, WES, BPL, and EPD represent 19.88% of the MLP ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:     Name Symbol Recent Price Avg. Analyst 12-Mo. Target % Upside to Target    MLP ETF   MLPA   $11.02   $12.65   14.78%    Western Gas Partners LP WES $53.20 $64.23 20.73%   Buckeye Partners LP BPL $63.67 $76.60 20.31%   Enterprise Products Partners L.P. EPD $27.68 $32.46 17.27%      Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.   10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »

How Risky Is Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.?
Three key metrics suggest that this MLP is fairly low risk, though those numbers alone don’t mean this investment is risk-free.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 18, 2017 at 10:35AM
            
            





Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) operates a relatively low-risk business model since the bulk of its earnings come from an extensive portfolio of fee-based pipelines and storage terminals. However, building that stable portfolio is just one of the steps the company has taken to keep risk at bay. Here's a closer look at how it stacks up against its peers and how its lower risk profile has helped the company overcome obstacles in the past so it could continue paying a growing distribution to investors.
Drilling down into the numbers
Three critical numbers for MLP investors are the percentage of cash flow underpinned by fees, the distribution coverage ratio, and the leverage ratio. Here's how Magellan Midstream Partners' metrics compare to several notable rivals:




Company


Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA


Current Distribution Coverage Ratio


% of Cash Flow Fee-Based or Regulated 






Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD)


4.3 times


1.2 times


93%




Magellan Midstream Partners


3.5 times


1.2 times


87%




Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE:PAA)


4.8 times


1.0 times


90%




Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ)


4.5 times


1.17 times


97%




Data source: Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, Plains All American Pipeline, and Williams Partners. 
As that chart shows, Magellan Midstream Partners has some of the most conservative metrics in its peer group. Its leverage ratio, for example, is well under 4.0 times, which is considered a safe zone for MLPs. Likewise, the company can currently cover its generous payout with room to spare since it has one of the highest coverage ratios in the group. Those two metrics, when combined with the fact that fee-based contracts underpin about 87% of its cash flow is why the company has one of the best credit ratings among MLPs, tied with Enterprise Products Partners.
That said, if there is one concern with those metrics, it's that fees only underpin 87% of cash flow, which is the lowest in the group. This factor has had an impact on the company in recent years. For example, last year distributable cash flow barely budged despite the completion of several growth projects. Meanwhile, the company was only able to reaffirm its guidance for 2017 even after securing a new contract for a recently completed project because the cash flow from that agreement would only offset the negative impact that weaker-than-expected commodity prices are having on earnings. However, with ample distribution coverage, the company has plenty of cushion to ensure that it can continue paying its distribution even if prices remain weak, which puts its payout on a much more sustainable footing than Plains All American Pipelines since it's just barely covering its distribution. Meanwhile, the company continues investing capital in building more fee-based assets that should further mute its direct exposure to commodity prices.

Risk mitigation in action
Magellan Midstream Partners' numbers suggest that it shouldn't have any problem maintaining its payout even if it runs into an unexpected issue. That has certainly been the case during the recent oil market downturn since it has been able to not only maintain its payout but has joined Enterprise Products Partners as one of the few MLPs that has continued growing its distribution. 
One reason Magellan has been able to do this is due to its top-notch balance sheet, which has proven to be a competitive advantage during the downturn because it has been able to access capital at a much cheaper rate than rivals. For example, Williams Partners had to offer a 7.85% interest rate to entice investors to buy the $1 billion of 10-year debt it was selling early last year when it needed cash for a looming debt maturity and to finance expansion. Meanwhile, Plains All American Pipeline had to offer an 8% yielding preferred to get the $1.5 billion it needed last year to fund expansion projects. Contrast those rates with the 5% that Magellan locked in when it offered $650 million of 10-year notes early last year so that it could refinance debt and fund growth projects.
Given their much higher capital costs, both Williams Partners and Plains All American Pipelines would go on to slash their payouts by double digits last year to shore up their financial situations. Meanwhile, because Magellan had no problem accessing the capital it needed, it was able to increase its payout by 10% last year and is on pace to grow it by 8% in 2017 and by the same rate in 2018. 





Investor takeaway
Magellan Midstream Partners boasts some of the most conservative financial metrics in its peer groups. Those have proven to be a crucial advantage in recent years because they've allowed the company to overcome several obstacles. That history demonstrates to investors that Magellan is a low-risk company that has the financial strength to make it through tough times.

UPDATE 1-Magnitude 4.2 earthquake strikes near Cushing oil storage hub
Friday, 14 Jul 2017 | 12:11  PM ETReuters



SHARES











(Adds statements from Phillips 66 and Enterprise Products Partners, context and background on earthquakes)
HOUSTON, July 14 (Reuters) - An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.2 on Friday struck Stroud, Oklahoma, about 20 miles (32.2 km) from the key oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS) said.
There have been no initial reports of damage from the quake, Oklahoma Corporation Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said by phone, cautioning that it was still early to determine the impact of the temblor.

A series of aftershocks shook the area in the hour following the earthquake, including two quakes measuring at magnitude 3.7 and 3.8, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
So far, oil companies operating the tanks and pipelines around the Cushing hub have reported no damage. Phillips 66 said it was monitoring the situation but was not impacted. Enterprise Products Partners said it had assessed its facilities and found no earthquake-related issues.
Oklahoma has experienced a rash of earthquakes in the past few years following a surge of oil and gas production in the state. The quakes have been attributed to the injection of saltwater, a normal byproduct of oil and gas production, into disposal wells.
Several larger quakes have occurred previously near the Cushing storage hub, which is the delivery hub for U.S. crude oil futures and houses some 57.6 million barrels of oil. It is sometimes referred to as the "Pipeline Crossroads of the World."
In November 2016, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake impacted residents and businesses about two miles (3.2 km) west of Cushing. (Reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Marguerita Choy)






















































































Growth-Income Combo With Enterprise Products Partners L.P. - Enterprise Products Partners L.P (NYSE:EPD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Growth-Income Combo With Enterprise Products Partners L.P.Jul.11.17 | About: Enterprise Products (EPD) Callum Turcan Oil & gas, long-term horizon, Growth, Deep ValueLinkedIn ProfileSummaryEnterprise Products Partners L.P. has a very well covered 6% yield.Shin Oak Pipeline project creates several avenues to capitalize on booming liquids production out of the Permian Basin.Outspend to fund construction of growth portfolio a concern if maintained indefinitely.Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) seeks to reward unitholders through its 6+% yield and consistent growth. Its distribution is on track to keep growing by at least 5% a year, and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has that payout well covered. Let's dig into this high yielding midstream firm.  Overview  By the end of the first quarter, Enterprise had $5.64 billion in current assets and $51.53 billion in total assets. Stacked up against $7.05 billion in current liabilities and $21.12 billion in long term debt. Enterprise posted $771 million in net income, up from $670 million a year ago. The midstream major generated $1.129 billion in distributable cash flow during the first quarter of 2017. With a solid distribution coverage ratio of 1.3X, Enterprise's high yield is very well protected. After its large payout the firm had $238 million left "to fund growth capital projects, reduce debt and decrease the need to issue additional equity." While Enterprise spent $460 million on capital expenditures in Q1, investors should note that will move higher during the coming quarters. Management forecasted that the firm would spend between $2.95 billion - $3.25 billion on growth and maintenance capex ($250 million in sustaining capex) this year.  To bring its growth portfolio online Enterprise is running an outspend. Common for many midstream firms, as additional debt or equity issuance (to cover the outspend) is justified by new revenue generating assets coming online.  In moderation this debt/equity for new revenue generating asset scheme makes sense, it is what built all of the midstream giants we see today. The volume, fee-based revenue streams from certain midstream assets, such as pipelines and NGLs fractionators, can often generate very favorable returns well in excess of the cost of capital.
 

 Source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P.  Growth Enterprise Products Partners has a large runway of projects to complete in order to bolster its DCF streams. The firm seeks to capitalize on booming liquids production out of the Permian Basin, rising global plastics demand, and the America's coming petrochemical boom all at once by building out NGL infrastructure.  Natural gas liquids are considered the 'wet gas' part of production streams, such as butane, natural gasoline, propane, and ethane. Like oil & gas it needs to be transported to end consumers and midstream infrastructure is needed to support operations. NGLs can be used to help make anything from fuel to detergent to plastics products to anti-freeze to synthetic rubber, making those hydrocarbons a key part of an industrial 21st century.  Wet gas represents a material part of the estimated ultimate recovery in unconventional Permian wells, depending on the play being targeted. Usually representing 10-25% of the production mix. So a ~100,000 bpd increase in oil production tends to indicate a ~15,000 bpd increase in NGLs production.  A great example of how Enterprise makes the most out of its extensive portfolio can be found at the Shin Oak pipeline development. Stretching 571 miles from the Permian Basin in West Texas to Mont Belvieu along the southeastern coast of the state, it will carry an initial 250,000 bpd of NGLs to Enterprise's storage and fractionation hub. Long term commitments signed well before the pipeline comes online ensure there will be guaranteed volumes to handle.  Shin Oak will be expandable up to 600,000 bpd of transportation capacity, with the 250,000 bpd pipeline set to be completed by Q2 2019. Investors should note that when management comments that an asset can be expanded, it doesn't mean there is demand for such an expansion. Enterprise stated it would seek out a JV partner to support an expansion, but reading into that, management may be implying that part of Enterprise's stake in the pipeline will be sold off to cover the cost of bringing it online. 
 Portfolio synergies  The Shin Oak pipeline offers up a lot of synergies. Starting at the top, Enterprise is feeding the line with NGLs separated out by its cryogenic gas processing plants in the Permian Basin. Enterprise brought two facilities online in the region back in 2016, the 200 MMcf/d South Eddy and 150 MMcf/d Delaware Basin gas plants, with plans to go bigger. Combined, those two plants have 47,000 bpd of NGLs extraction capacity. Enterprise is set to bring the (300 MMcf/d, 40,000 bpd) Orla I gas plant online by Q2 2018. Due to rising supply Enterprise is going further with the Orla II plant, set to be completed by Q3 2018, which has the same amount of capacity as the Orla I facility.  There remains room for plenty of expansions, especially once the Shin Oak pipeline is completed ensuring those NGL volumes can get to end consumers. Once operational, Enterprise will have over 1 Bcf/d of gas processing capacity and the ability to extract 150,000 bpd of NGLs in the Permian Basin.  At Mont Belvieu, Enterprise is sitting on eight NGLs fractionators with 670,000 bpd of processing capacity. Construction is underway at a ninth facility to add 85,000 bpd of NGLs fractionation capacity due to be completed in Q2 2018. Operations are supported by 130 million barrels of NGL storage capacity. Rising NGLs volumes would keep utilization rates high and create demand for future expansions.  Final thoughts Enterprise Products Partners L.P. has many ways to grow its fee-based DCF streams, the Shin Oak Pipeline project and the various synergies that development creates is just one example. What Enterprise Products Partners L.P. needs to do is watch its outspend, but on the flip side its distribution is very well covered. As long as management keeps fiscal discipline in mind, the midstream growth model should pan out favorably.

Forget Chevron, Here's A Higher Yielding, Faster Growing, And Much Safer Income Investment - Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Forget Chevron, Here's A Higher Yielding, Faster Growing, And Much Safer Income InvestmentJul.11.17 | About: Chevron Corporation (CVX) Dividend Sensei Dividend growth investing, master limited partnerships, REITs, long-term horizonDividendSensei.comSummaryThe worst oil crash in over 50 years continues to offer excellent long-term deals in an otherwise overvalued market.However, investors need to be very careful about separating the wheat from the chaff, because payout cuts are a very real risk in this cyclical industry.Chevron, as one of only a handful of energy dividend aristocrats, is considered a best in breed blue chip, and for good reason.However, Enterprise Products Partners, offers a higher, safer, and faster growing payout.Given the risk of oil prices remaining under $55 for several more years, Enterprise Products Partners makes the clearly superior high-yield income investment.

 Chevron (CVX), is one of the best run oil companies in the world, a true "best in breed" industry blue chip. It also happens to be one of only three dividend aristocrats in the energy sector, which explains why it's a favorite among low risk, high-yield investors. That being said, investing is never done in a vacuum, and should oil prices may remain under $55 for several more years, Chevron's dividend security is likely to deteriorate badly. Let's take a look at just why Chevron, despite its immense access to capital, still needs oil prices to rise in order to ensure the safety and continued growth of its dividend. On the other hand, Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), the gold standard of midstream MLPs, offers not just a higher, safer, and faster growing payout, but one that is likely to remain safe even in a low energy price world. Chevron's Results Are Getting Better, But Still Not Good Enough   Metric Q1 2016 Q1 2017 YoY Change   Revenue $23.6 billion $33.4 billion 41.9%   Net Income -$725 million $2.7 billion NA   Free Cash Flow -$4.4 billion $564 million NA   EPS -$0.39 $1.41 NA   FCF/Share -$2.37 $0.30 NA   Forward Dividend $1.07 $1.08 0.9%   FCF Payout Ratio -45.2% 362.9% NA   Source: Morningstar As you can see, Chevron's first quarter results benefited greatly from the past year's rise in oil and natural gas prices. 

WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Of course, those impressive increases were off of multi-year lows hit in January of 2016, and the fact remains that Chevron's net income and free cash flow (what ultimately secures and grows the dividend) still don't come close to being high enough to ensure that Chevron's 29-year dividend growth streak can remain intact in the future. Now, don't get me wrong, management fully realizes that its status as a dividend aristocrat is one of the biggest reasons that investors own it and has stated matter of factly that maintaining this payout growth streak is the company's top priority. 



That being said, there are a few key factors that could protect the payout and keep it growing slowly. 


 Primarily that includes the company's years of cost cutting and increased focus on the most profitable, low decline projects, such as the Wheaton and Gorgon LNG projects. Thanks to these and other projects coming online soon, Chevron expects to report industry-leading production growth this year. 

For example, even factoring in asset sales, Chevron expects production growth of 2.8% annually through 2020. Together, these factors mean that management expects to be cash flow neutral (capex + dividend covered by cash flow) at about Brent oil prices of $50 per barrel. 

Source: Chevron Investor Presentation Of course, that includes about $3 to $7 billion in 2017 asset sales, which means that in order for Chevron to cover its dividend organically and continue growing at even a token amount would require Brent prices of about $55, or 15% higher than today. 

Meanwhile, if crude rises to $70 then Chevron is well situated to see post-dividend free cash flow soar to $8 billion (not including asset sales), allowing it to return to its historically strong dividend 7% to 8% growth rate.

 Enterprise Products Partners: Well Situated To Benefit From Rising US Shale Production Unlike Chevron, whose upstream (oil production) business gives it massive commodity exposure, Enterprise Products Partners is a midstream MLP, that owns one of America's largest: oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids ((NGLs)), and refined petroleum products transportation, processing, and storage systems. 

 Source: Enterprise Products Partners Investor Presentation Best of all Enterprise's distributable cash flow or DCF (MLP equivalent of FCF and what funds the distribution) is almost all under long-term, fixed fee contracts, with almost no commodity exposure. 

This creates very stable and growing cash flows even during oil crashes, allowing the MLP to raise its payout like clockwork, no matter what energy prices, the economy, or interest rates are doing. 

 In fact, Enterprise has raised its distribution every quarter for 51 straight quarters, or almost 13 years. Better yet? Because necessity is the mother of invention (and productivity growth), the oil crash has resulted in shale producers becoming so much more efficient, that even at today's oil & gas prices, they can generate solid rates of return in all major shale formations.
 



 This is why the US rig count has now risen for 24 of the last 25 weeks, and why US oil production is expected to not just rise this year, but set a new all-time record next, as well as keep growing for years to come. 

US Rig Count data by YCharts 

 This extremely bullish outlook on US oil & gas production is why Enterprise is investing $8.4 billion into new projects (all of which are already contracted) in the coming years, which is set to send its highly stable cash flow soaring. 

Better yet? America's ongoing shale boom is expected to spur $700 to $900 billion in new midstream infrastructure spending over the next decade.
 Or to put another way? Enterprise Products Partners has a VERY long growth runway and, unlike Chevron, benefits immensely from rising US oil production due to its commodity insensitive, contracted cash flows. Balance Sheet: The Unsung Hero Of Dividend Safety   Company Debt/EBITDA EBITDA/Interest Debt/Capital Current Ratio S&P Credit Rating   Chevron 2.04 88.02 19% 1.04 AA-   Industry Average 2.17 NA 30% 1.12 NA   Source: Morningstar, Fast Graphs The oil crash has taught income investors some very important and painful lessons about the necessity of a strong balance to sustain payouts during times of industry distress. Fortunately, Chevron's long-term focused management has done a great job in keeping its relative debt levels low, allowing it to borrow to protect the dividend during energy crashes while still maintaining a very strong credit rating. 

However, it's also true that Chevron's need to borrow to fund its dividend has already resulted in a credit downgrade by both S&P and Moody's, and unless oil prices increase management's seemingly absolute dedication to continuing its dividend growth streak could be put to the test.   MLP Debt/EBITDA EBITDA/Interest Debt/Capital Current Ratio S&P Credit Rating   Enterprise Products Partners 4.47 5.29 45% 0.80 BBB+   Industry Average 6.47 NA 62% 0.83 NA   Meanwhile, like Chevron, Enterprise Products Partners' management has been highly conservative with its balance sheet, resulting in EPD being tied with Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) for the strongest credit rating in the entire MLP industry. That's why Enterprise today enjoys $4.1 billion in available liquidity with which to funds its growth. More importantly, the strong balance sheet means that EPD isn't likely to face the kind of liquidity trap that caused so many peers to have to cut their payouts during the darkest days of the oil crash.
 Payout Profile: Enterprise Products Likely To Generate Stronger Future Total Returns   Energy Stock Yield TTM Payout Coverage Ratio 10 Year Projected Payout Growth 10 Year Expected Annual Total Return   Chevron 4.2% -28.58 3% to 5% 7.2% to 9.2%   Enterprise Products Partners 6.2% 1.26 5% 11.2%   S&P 500 1.9% 2.53 5.7% 9.1%   Sources: Earnings Releases, Morningstar, Fast Graphs, FactSet Research, Multpl.com, Moneychimp.com As a high-yield income growth investor, I care about three things: a company's current yield, the safety of the payout, and its long-term growth prospects. And, while Chevron boasts a yield more than double that of the broader market, it pales in comparison to Enterprise's. More importantly, while Chevron's current cash flow doesn't come close to covering the dividend, Enterprise's coverage ratio is rock solid (anything above 1.1 for an MLP indicates a sustainable distribution with room to grow). That's why I expect EPD to deliver better payout growth and, combined with its superior yield, much better total returns in the next decade. Valuation: Chevron Is Cheaper, But Enterprise Is Still A Better Buy 

CVX Total Return Price data by YCharts While some investors prefer to stay away from energy stocks during periods of declining oil prices, I view such times as the perfect buying opportunity.   Energy Stock Yield Historical Yield   Chevron 4.2% 3.3%   Enterprise Products Partners 6.2% 5.7%   Source: GuruFocus After all, thanks to the ongoing oil crash today, both Chevron and Enterprise are trading at significant discounts to their 13-year median yields.   Energy Stock Forward Annual Payout 10 Year Projected Payout Growth Fair Value Estimate Growth Baked Into Current Price Margin Of Safety   Chevron $4.32 4% $129.28 -6.1% 20%   Enterprise Products Partners $1.68 5% $28.67 3.9% 6%   Source: GuruFocus And, when we take a longer view via a 20-year discounted dividend analysis, which takes into account the present day value of these energy stocks' future likely dividends (discounted at the S&P 500's historical 9.1% annual total return since 1871), we see pretty much the same thing. Specifically that, both Chevron and Enterprise are undervalued, though because of Chevron's riskier payout, the market is discounting its shares far more. That being said, I would have no qualms about recommending an MLP of EPD's grade A caliber anytime it is trading at fair value or below, due to its unbeatable track record of safe and consistent payout growth over time. Risks To Consider:  While oil prices are impossible to predict in the short term, it's likely that in the coming years, falling oil inventories and a lack of a supply glut (even with increased US shale production) should cause a modest increase in crude prices. 

Source: Enterprise Products Partners Investor Presentation After all, global demand is now firmly above supply, and global inventories are falling rapidly, including the just announced 8.1 million barrel drawdown in the US following last week's 6.4 million barrel decline. 

However, those rosy projections are based on continued strong demand growth, especially from emerging markets. Thus, it's always possible that a major economic shock, such as bursting of China's enormous debt bubble, could: plunge the world into recession, greatly decrease oil demand, and send crude prices plunging once more.
 That would likely guarantee a dividend cut from Chevron. Meanwhile, even Enterprise Products Partners, the ultimate sleep well at night or SWAN MLP, might find itself struggling given that it needs to occasionally tap equity markets to raise growth capital. 

 That's because, despite the commodity insensitive nature of the industry's cash flows, MLP unit prices still generally trade in the direction of crude prices; especially since the start of the oil crash. Bottom Line: Chevron Is A Great Oil Stock, But Given Industry Uncertainties, Enterprise Is The Far Superior High-Yield Energy Investment Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Chevron isn't a potentially good high-yield dividend growth investment. In fact, other than Exxon Mobil (XOM), it's the single best income stock of any major oil producer. That being said, despite management's dedication to keeping its nearly three decade dividend growth streak alive at all costs, the fact remains that, barring a significant recovery in oil & gas prices, Chevron's dividend is currently unsustainable. On the other hand, Enterprise Products Partners, thanks to its commodity insensitive, toll-booth business model, is well positioned to continue providing generous, highly secure, and moderately fast growing payouts to investors for years, or even decades to come, courtesy of America's ongoing shale fracking boom.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P.: The Bear Case From a Bull
A look at some of the risks that bullish investors should keep in mind.

It's no secret that I believe Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is an excellent company to own for the long term. Fueling that bullishness is the fact that the pipeline giant has a rock-solid business model and visible growth prospects on the horizon thanks to the $8.6 billion of capital projects it has lined up. These factors should enable the company to continue to grow its distribution to investors. 
That said, just because I'm bullish on the company doesn't mean I don't pay attention to bearish arguments. Quite the opposite, in fact, since I have a growing portion of my net worth invested in the company, which is at risk if bears are right. That's why I think it's a good idea to review their case so that investors know full well the risks involved when investing in Enterprise Products Partners.

Its access to cheap capital might dry up
Enterprise Products Partners is one of the most fiscally conservative master limited partnerships (MLPs) in the sector. By keeping its leverage ratio around 4.0 times or less, the company has earned one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs. Furthermore, it also maintains a large margin of safety on its distribution, averaging more than 1.2 times coverage last year, allowing it to retain $675 million of cash flow to finance growth projects. Because of that strong financial profile, it has never had any issues accessing the money it needs to fund expansion.
That said, the company typically needs to raise a boatload of outside capital to finance these projects. Last year, for example, it spent nearly $3.9 billion on capex. Since it only generated $709 million in excess cash for the year, it needed to issue roughly $3.2 billion of debt and equity to bridge the gap. While it didn't have any trouble raising that money last year, a deep credit market crisis in the future could make it hard for Enterprise to obtain the cash it needs to finance growth projects at acceptable rates.
That was the case for several of its rivals during the recent oil market downturn. For example, ONEOK's (NYSE:OKE) former MLP needed to secure $1 billion in bank financing early last year so it could refinance an upcoming bond maturity after longer-term funding options became prohibitively expensive. ONEOK's affiliate expected that the move would eliminate its need to access the public debt and equity markets until well into 2017, which bought it time while it waited for the capital markets to open back up. While Enterprise Products Partners avoided a similar fate last year, it did issue twice as much equity to finance growth projects as it usually does to keep its leverage metrics low, which shows that it's not completely immune to market dislocations.

Opposition to new pipeline projects intensifies
Enterprise Products Partners has a long history of completing its growth projects on time and on budget. That's one reason why the company has been able to increase its distribution to investors in each of the last 52 quarters. Meanwhile, with $8.6 billion of capital projects under construction, Enterprise Products Partners should be able to keep that streak going for at least the next few years. 
That said, Enterprise has been one of the lucky ones since it hasn't run into any major issues completing new projects. Rivals Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP) and Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ), on the other hand, have run into several unforeseen issues in recent years that have delayed major expansion projects. In Energy Transfer Partners' case, it encountered opposition that tried to block its attempts to finish the $4.78 billion Bakken Pipeline System, which ended up delaying its in-service date by more than six months, costing it millions in added expenses and cash flow. Meanwhile, Williams Partners experienced a delay in receiving approval for its $3 billion Atlantic Sunrise project and was denied a permit for its nearly $1 billion Constitution Pipeline due to opposition to those projects. 
Given the increasing worries about climate change, opposition to new oil and gas projects will likely continue rising in the years ahead. That could eventually impact Enterprise Products Partners' growth plans by either causing a lengthy delay of a critical project or even forcing the company to cancel a project due to issues receiving permits. A string of costly delays or project cancellations could end up halting the company's distribution growth streak. 





Investor takeaway
Bulls like me love Enterprise Products Partners' ability to leverage its vast portfolio of fee-based assets and deliver steady income growth over the long term. That said, for the company to continue growing, it needs access to cheap capital and the ability to move forward with its expansion projects without facing any significant delays or unforeseen expenses. Given the issues its peers have had in the recent past, these aren't risks that bulls should take lightly. However, because the company is more conservative than most rivals, it does have a greater cushion to withstand a setback. That's why I remain confident that it can continue to grow at a healthy rate for years to come.

Appeals court rules for Enterprise in pipeline case

1 / 2


Back to Gallery









 

A state appellate court on Wednesday overturned a $535 million judgment against Houston's Enterprise Products Partners, which had been sued by Energy Transfer Partners in a case with undertones of the landmark Pennzoil v. Texaco court battle of the 1980s.
The decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Dallas reverses a 2014 ruling that created a Texas legal precedent equating a preliminary business agreement to a common-law marriage between two businesses. The legal fight pitted two of the nation's largest pipeline companies against each other.



Enterprise and Dallas-based Energy Transfer planned to partner on an oil pipeline project from Cushing, Okla., to the Houston area. But Enterprise nixed the deal because it couldn't line up enough customers. Instead, Enterprise teamed up up with Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge on a more profitable deal for a similar pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners sued in 2012, alleging Enterprise violated a binding agreement and won a state district court ruling in 2014. 


Enterprise argued the agreement was never binding and the signed disclaimer agreements ensured that nothing would be definitive until the boards of directors approved the deal or project documents were made final. Neither happened. 
The unanimous appellate court ruling determined the 2014 jury decision "wrongly imposed the burden of proof on Enterprise" and that the evidence against Enterprise was "legally and factually" lacking.

Energy Transfer contended that Texas law allows binding business partnerships without formal contracts on paper, similar to the argument that Pennzoil used in its suit against Texaco in the 1980s. Pennzoil, which contended a handshake agreement was binding on the parties, won a jury award of $10.5 billion, which was the largest civil verdict in the nation's history at the time and created a chill over deal-making.
The court, however, ruled that the state law doesn't apply to this case because Enterprise and Energy Transfer did not decide to "carry on a business for profit." They only agreed to research whether it was possible to build a profitable pipeline together, according to the ruling.
"This case needed decisive action because it had the potential to stand as one of the worst for business in Texas since the Texaco v. Pennzoil decision from the 1980s," Enterprise appellate lawyer David Keltner said. "Sophisticated parties need the right to rely on written contracts."
"We are disappointed in the ruling and will likely appeal the decision to the Texas Supreme Court," Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.
Back in 2011, Enterprise and Energy Transfer determined that potential customers wanted to be able ship oil from Canada to Houston, and their proposed pipeline couldn't offer that option.
Enbridge, however, could because of a pipeline project from Canada to Cushing.
Enterprise and Enbridge ended up building the expanded Seaway Pipeline, which runs from Cushing to Freeport. They complected the project in early 2015.

Enterprise Products Prevails in Dallas Court of Appeals






























HOUSTON, Jul 19, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Enterprise Products Partners L.P.                 

/quotes/zigman/229258/composite EPD
-1.30%


 today        
announced the 
      company has prevailed in its appeal against Energy Transfer Partners. 
      This appeal stems from a 2014 Dallas jury verdict in a lawsuit filed by 
      Energy Transfer over a proposed pipeline project that was cancelled due 
      to a lack of customer support. This case has been a long, hard battle 
      and Enterprise is grateful to the Fifth Court of Appeals for their hard 
      work.


                                        








In April 2011, Enterprise and Energy Transfer signed a series of 
      agreements disclaiming any partnership or joint venture absent executed 
      definitive documents and board approvals of the two companies. 
      Definitive agreements were never executed and board approval was never 
      obtained. The parties signed these disclaiming agreements precisely to 
      avoid the type of lawsuit brought here.


                                        








Enterprise management is grateful that the Dallas Court of Appeals 
      correctly reaffirmed the importance of written contracts. “This case 
      needed decisive action because it had the potential to stand as one of 
      the worst for business in Texas since the         
Texaco v. Pennzoil        
 
      decision from the 1980s,” said Enterprise appellate lawyer David E. 
      Keltner. “Sophisticated parties need the right to rely on written 
      contracts. Partnership by ambush is a bad public policy and goes against 
      the freedom to contract guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. The 
      business world breathed a sigh of relief today when ‘partnership by 
      ambush’ was ruled out of bounds in Texas.”

History[edit]
In 2005, Ralph S. Cunningham became CEO of Enterprise Products Partners.[1]
On July 23, 2007, Cunningham replaced Michael A. Creel as president and CEO of the affiliated Enterprise GP Holdings LP (NYSE: EPE). Cunningham had earlier been named interim president and CEO, and resigned from the Enterprise Products CEO position effective July 31, 2007. Creel then became president and CEO of the company's general partner Enterprise Products Partners L.P.[1]
Cunningham also became a director of both Enterprise GP Holdings and affiliated Duncan Energy Partners LP (NYSE: EPL).[1]
Enterprise Products acquired Enterprise GP Holdings in 2010.
Incidents[edit]
On February 8, 2011, a series of explosions destroyed much of a Mont Belvieu facility owned and operated by Enterprise Products. The ensuing fire was controlled after two hours. One contractor at the plant was not accounted for, however no other injuries were reported.[2]
On January 26, 2015, a 20-inch Enterprise Products ATEX pipeline carrying ethane exploded and burned in Brooke County, West Virginia. Despite snow in the area, five acres of woodlands burned, and 1,283,000 gallons of ethane were consumed, or lost. The fireball melted siding on nearby homes and damaged power lines; it is believed that day’s snowy weather lessened the damage. Reports suspect a girth weld failure from ductile tensile overload, with the pipeline being less than two years old. There were no injuries.[3]
On December 1, 2015, personnel from Enterprise discovered a spill at their West Cushing Tank Farm, in Cushing, Oklahoma. Approximately 42,000 gallons of crude oil were released within the terminal. A tank line had failed from internal corrosion.[4]
On January 30, 2017, a road crew punctured the Seaway S-1 crude oil pipeline in Texas, which is jointly joined by Enterprise Products Partners and the Canadian Enbridge Inc. through the joint venture Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Two days later, it was unclear how much oil had spilled over the nearby Highway 121 northeast of Dallas. After the incident, supply concerns reportedly helped push "oil prices 2% higher in early trading to nearly $54 a barrel.[5]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  22.03 (07/21/17)      EPS (TTM)  $1.24      Market Cap $58.51 B     Shares Outstanding 2.14 B     Public Float 1.45 B     Yield 6.15% (07/21/17)      Latest Dividend $0.42 (08/07/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 07/27/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (06/30/17)    Shares Sold Short 28.71 M     Change from Last  18.22%      Percent of Float 1.98%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.43      Net Money Flow ($)  5.44 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

Creel then became president and CEO of the company's general partner Enterprise Products Partners L.P.[1]
Cunningham also became a director of both Enterprise GP Holdings and affiliated Duncan Energy Partners LP (NYSE: EPL).[1]
Enterprise Products acquired Enterprise GP Holdings in 2010.
Incidents[edit]
On February 8, 2011, a series of explosions destroyed much of a Mont Belvieu facility owned and operated by Enterprise Products. The ensuing fire was controlled after two hours. One contractor at the plant was not accounted for, however no other injuries were reported.[2]
On January 26, 2015, a 20-inch Enterprise Products ATEX pipeline carrying ethane exploded and burned in Brooke County, West Virginia. Despite snow in the area, five acres of woodlands burned, and 1,283,000 gallons of ethane were consumed, or lost. The fireball melted siding on nearby homes and damaged power lines; it is believed that day’s snowy weather lessened the damage. Reports suspect a girth weld failure from ductile tensile overload, with the pipeline being less than two years old. There were no injuries.[3]
On December 1, 2015, personnel from Enterprise discovered a spill at their West Cushing Tank Farm, in Cushing, Oklahoma. Approximately 42,000 gallons of crude oil were released within the terminal. A tank line had failed from internal corrosion.[4]
On January 30, 2017, a road crew punctured the Seaway S-1 crude oil pipeline in Texas, which is jointly joined by Enterprise Products Partners and the Canadian Enbridge Inc. through the joint venture Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Two days later, it was unclear how much oil had spilled over the nearby Highway 121 northeast of Dallas. After the incident, supply concerns reportedly helped push "oil prices 2% higher in early trading to nearly $54 a barrel.[5]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
