					The first quarter of 2017 started out strong for our title business. FNF generated an 11.1% adjusted pre-tax title margin, recorded the largest amount of first quarter adjusted pre-tax title earnings in the history of the company, and experienced increases in both open and closed residential purchase orders. We expect seasonal acceleration over the next few quarters and look forward to continued strong, industry-leading performance from our title insurance business.

Fraud Warning

	Be alert to internet escrow sites stating that they are affiliated, incorporated or “backed by” Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF) or its wholly owned subsidiary, Micro General Corporation. These statements are false.

	In 1999, Escrow.com was founded by FNF, and is now a privately held company that has pioneered the process of online escrow services. Escrow.com is a reputable internet escrow provider and is located at www.escrow.com.

	Since the sale of Escrow.com, FNF has not owned, operated, incorporated, backed or otherwise been affiliated with any internet escrow site. Some persons doing business with escrow sites other than Escrow.com have reported sending money to the other escrow sites but have never received merchandise and never found a way to contact the other escrow companies to recover the money sent.

	If this has happened to you, we recommend that you file a complaint with local law enforcement and online with the FBI at http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ("FNFI") and Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE:   BKFS) today announced the signing of formal agreements related to the previously announced tax-free distribution (the "Distribution Plan") in which FNFI intends to distribute all 83.3 million shares of Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. ("Black Knight") common stock that it currently owns to FNF Group (NYSE:   FNF) stockholders. 








Under the Distribution Plan, Black Knight Holdings, Inc. ("BKHI") will contribute all of its shares of Black Knight Class B common stock and Black Knight Financial Services, LLC membership interests into a newly-formed subsidiary, New BKH Corp. ("New BKH"), in exchange for all of the shares of New BKH common stock.  BKHI will then distribute to FNFI all of the shares of New BKH common stock, which will then be distributed to FNF stockholders by FNFI.  Immediately following the distribution of New BKH common stock to FNF stockholders, New BKH and Black Knight will each merge in stock-for-stock transactions with two separate, newly-formed subsidiaries of Black Knight Holdco Corp. ("New Black Knight"), which will be a newly-established public holding company for Black Knight.  In the mergers, FNF stockholders will ultimately receive a total of 83.3 million shares of New Black Knight common stock, or approximately 0.305551 shares for each share of FNF common stock that they own.  The remaining holders of Black Knight's common stock (other than New BKH) will receive one share of New Black Knight for each share of Black Knight Class A common stock they own. Black Knight currently has approximately 154.2 million shares, in the aggregate, of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. FNFI currently has approximately 272.7 million shares of FNF common stock outstanding and, at the conclusion of the Distribution Plan, New Black Knight will have shares outstanding equal in amount to the Black Knight shares outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the transactions.  The Distribution Plan is expected to be tax-free to all existing FNF and Black Knight stockholders.    
FNFI has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the tax-free treatment of the distribution of the Black Knight shares.  The Distribution Plan is subject to filing and acceptance of the registration statements for the Black Knight distribution with the Securities and Exchange Commission; receipt of required regulatory approvals; Black Knight stockholder approval (including the approval of Black Knight's stockholders other than FNFI and its subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers); and other customary closing conditions.  The distribution is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.
The agreements relating to the Distribution Plan have been approved by the Board of Directors of both FNFI and Black Knight. The Board of Directors of Black Knight acted following the recommendation of a Special Committee comprised of two independent directors of Black Knight. The Special Committee retained independent financial and legal advisors, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, to advise the Special Committee.

Fidelity National Financial, Inc. Announces FNF Group Acquisition of Commissions, Inc.


JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Fidelity National Financial, Inc. today announced that FNF Group (NYSE: FNF) has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Commissions, Inc. ("CINC"), the fastest-growing provider of an end-to-end SaaS CRM, lead generation and lead management software platform focused on high-performing residential real estate agents and agent teams.  
Product offerings include software, marketing and services designed to enhance the productivity and sales results of elite Realtors® and agent teams through lead generation and proactive lead management.  CINC has more than 1,500 customers who collectively have closed more than 170,000 residential real estate transactions over the last twelve months.
"We are excited to partner with CINC to bring value-added technology and services to our Realtor® customers," said Chairman, William P. Foley, II.  "To this point, CINC's strong revenue and customer growth has been largely organic, with minimal sales force efforts needed.  We plan to leverage FNF's title sales force to proactively cross-sell the CINC product suite to our leading customers.  With CINC's solid existing customer base, innovative product set and our combined plan for continued development of the CINC product suite, we find the opportunity for further significant revenue and EBITDA growth to be compelling."
"We look at everything from a 360-degree perspective," said Duane LeGate, CEO of CINC. "Joining FNF is a huge win for everyone involved.  Our clients get fresher, richer data with more access to actionable home buyers and sellers. Our employees get the capabilities and backing of a Fortune 500 company to help accelerate our growth. Most importantly, we are perfectly aligned culturally and know that we will be able to continue running the business as we always have, but with vastly increased resources."  
About Fidelity National Financial, Inc. Fidelity National Financial, Inc. is organized into two groups, FNF Group (NYSE: FNF) and FNFV Group (NYSE: FNFV).  FNF is a leading provider of title insurance, technology and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries.  FNF is the nation's largest title insurance company through its title insurance underwriters - Fidelity National Title, Chicago Title, Commonwealth Land Title, Alamo Title and National Title of New York - that collectively issue more title insurance policies than any other title company in the United States.  FNF also provides 
industry-leading mortgage technology solutions and transaction services, including MSP®, the leading residential mortgage servicing technology platform in the U.S., through its majority-owned subsidiaries, Black Knight Financial Services and ServiceLink Holdings.  FNFV holds majority and minority equity investment stakes in a number of entities, including American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC, Ceridian HCM, Inc., Digital Insurance, Inc. and Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc.  More information about FNF and FNFV can be found at www.fnf.com.

CINC's Co-Founder and CEO,

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements regarding our expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The risks and uncertainties which forward-looking statements are subject to include, but are not 
limited to: changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets; weakness or adverse changes in the level of real estate activity, which may be caused by, among other things, high or increasing interest rates, a limited supply of mortgage funding or a weak U. S. economy; our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our traditional areas of focus, or difficulties in integrating acquisitions; our dependence on distributions from our title insurance underwriters as a main source of cash flow; significant competition that our operating subsidiaries face; compliance with extensive government regulation of our operating subsidiaries; and other risks detailed in the "Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information," "Risk Factors" and other 
sections of the Company's Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

					The first quarter of 2017 started out strong for our title business. FNF generated an 11.1% adjusted pre-tax title margin, recorded the largest amount of first quarter adjusted pre-tax title earnings in the history of the company, and experienced increases in both open and closed residential purchase orders. We expect seasonal acceleration over the next few quarters and look forward to continued strong, industry-leading performance from our title insurance business.

					The first quarter of 2017 started out strong for our title business. FNF generated an 11.1% adjusted pre-tax title margin, recorded the largest amount of first quarter adjusted pre-tax title earnings in the history of the company, and experienced increases in both open and closed residential purchase orders. We expect seasonal acceleration over the next few quarters and look forward to continued strong, industry-leading performance from our title insurance business.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
