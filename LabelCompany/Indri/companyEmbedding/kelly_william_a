William Kelly Books



William Kelly (1823–1906), born in Ireland, moved to London after attending Trinity College in Dublin. Deeply involved with the Plymouth Brethren, he also became a prolific writer, earning the respect of theologians such as Henry Alford. He is quoted as having said “There are three things real—the Cross, the enmity of the world, the love of God.”

    About Kelly-Moore Paints
Mission To provide high quality, innovative products with exceptional service at a fair value. History In 1946, William H. Kelly and William E. Moore recognized the unique needs of professional painting contractors for top-quality paint products and knowledgeable, efficient service at a fair price. This philosophy has allowed Kelly-Moore to grow from a single manufacturing facility and store in San Carlos, California, to one of the largest employee-owned paint companies in the United States. Kelly-Moore is still recognized throughout the paint industry as providing consistently great paints, while innovating to the needs of the market, truly "The Painter's Paint Store!" Manufacturing - Made in America Since 1946 Kelly-Moore has two strategically located, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in key markets: San Carlos, California and Hurst, Texas (outside Dallas).   Our reputation for quality products is unsurpassed in the industry.  Kelly-Moore produces some of the most technologically advanced paint products and sets the industry standard for new product development and quality control. Our manufacturing facility in San Carlos is also the recipient of five widely recognized green business awards from the State of California and San Mateo County for outstanding efforts to reduce pollution and solid waste and conserve water, energy and other natural resources. Employee Owned – You are working with an owner. In 1998, Mr. and Mrs. William E. Moore established the Kelly-Moore Paint Company Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP).  Creating this program ensured the Moore Family tradition of providing only the highest level of service will continue for years to come.  Each employee-owner is committed to offering the best paint products along with exceptional customer service everyday.

5.0 out of 5 starsWilliam Holden best ever, again.ByWally Leitelon July 10, 2013I like (all my life since a small boy) western films. Some, maybe most of them, are not what one would call great or even very good of the hundreds (thousands of them made?) But I like that kind of story, all of the stuff about the old west, especially if they were somewhat true to how it really may have been.Some from the past,  1950's, 60's and a number of them from the 80's & 90's and more recently, I think...as Clint Eastwoods "Unforgiven," among some others as well...the good stories that Robert Duvall and Tom Selleck acted in, all fine movies. Then there is William Holden, so big, dominates the screen so much...the presence he has just being the man he was himself. A great actor and like Robert Redford or Spencer Tracy, he just lit up the screen when he appeared. Always I thought he ranked amongst the best of the best in anything I saw him in and this "Alvarez Kelly" is a fine example that would take me more time than allowed here to write all I want about the story.The story is very good, Widmark is good in the part he plays, and since I love the character driven stories especially, even with the war and the cattle drive, somehow the characters shined in this tough, rough western and it leaves me pondering long after I see it every time. It ended well and Holden did not get killed in the end as he has in at least 5 films I can think of at the moment...I never liked him losing & I am only one of millions that has him as one of the Hollywood heros of all time. You can make up your own ending somewhat or add to it...Kelly has to get to New York to find the girl, etc...Richard Widmark, the Colonel, keeps his word about letting Kelly go (even though Widmark's main man and aide almost kills Holden at the end." Bill Holden gets to ride off to smile that smile at someone else, use that charm and wit. For many, it reminds us of how he left us much too soon in real life, so young, at 63 I think and still as good as he ever was...one of the especially rare type of actors that will please lovers of good movies for all time. Watch "Alvarez Kelly" just for Bill Holden alone and you will love it.

I wanted this movie but cannot watch it since it was my fault for not being more careful when purchasing through Amazon.  BEWARE BEWARE!!!

Alvarez Kelly (1966)
This is the story of a renegade adventurer, Alvarez Kelly (William Holden), who gets caught in the middle of the Civil War. With no loyalties to either North or South, Kelly is hired to drive a herd of cattle from Mexico to the Union Army in Virginia. However, along the way he is captured by Confederate Colonel Tom Rossiter (Richard Widmark), who persuades him - by shooting off a finger - to deliver the cattle to the starving confederates in Richmond. At a bridge leading to Richmond, the Union Army attacks and a bloody battle ensues in which Kelly risks his own life to save a Confederate officer. In the end, Kelly's fate once again lies in the hands of Colonel Rossiter.
