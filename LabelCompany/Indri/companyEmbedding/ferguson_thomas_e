Thomas E. Ferguson Elected President of the Hydraulic Institute



Industry veteran is vice president of Flowserve Corp. and president of Flowserve Pumps

Dallas, Texas, USA - Flowserve Corp. (NYSE: FLS), a global provider of fluid motion and control products and services, announces that Thomas E. Ferguson has been elected president of the Hydraulic Institute for 2006-2007. He will also serve as a member of the board of directors.
Ferguson, an industry veteran, is a vice president of Flowserve Corp. and president of Flowserve Pumps. He has more than 24 years of experience in the flow control industry, including more than 15 years with Flowserve and one of its predecessor companies, BW/IP International.
The Hydraulic Institute is the largest association of pump producers and suppliers in North America. The Institute serves member companies and end-users by developing comprehensive industry standards, providing education and tools, and operating as a forum for information on pumps and pumping systems. It also works to promote the profitability and cost-effectiveness of the pump industry.
The president of the Hydraulic Institute works with the Institute’s staff and board to support its mission of serving the interests of member companies and pump users worldwide.
“Tom brings a legacy of active leadership and involvement that will continue to strengthen the work of the Hydraulic Institute in the years to come,” says Robert Asdal, executive director, the Hydraulic Institute.
“I am honored to take on this challenging and exciting role,” says Ferguson. “The Hydraulic Institute is the industry's primary forum for the exchange of pump industry information for management decision-making, and an influential participant in the setting of domestic and international standards. I look forward to bringing my experience from Flowserve to help further the goals of the Institute and the pump industry.”
Prior to serving as president of Flowserve Pumps, a position he has held since 2003, Ferguson was president of Flowserve Flow Solutions. Before that, he spent nine years in various sales, marketing, technical and general management positions within Flow Solutions.
Ferguson began his career with BW/IP in 1987, where he held positions in sales and marketing in the seals and pump divisions. He has also held key positions in the oil-field services sector, including nine years in sales, marketing and technical roles with companies such as Nowsco Well Service, Ltd. (now part of BJ Services), BJ Hughes (now part of Baker Hughes), and Zwick Energy Research.
Ferguson holds a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial distribution and technology from Texas A&M University. He also attended the University of Southern California Executive Management Program.

The Great Depression
An International Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies
Thomas E. Hall and J. David Ferguson
A concise analysis of the economic policy mistakes that led to the Great Depression and the consequences that followed





Description





The Great Depression was the worst economic catastrophe in modern history. Not only did it cause massive worldwide unemployment, but it also led to the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, World War II in Europe, and the tragic deaths of tens of millions of people. This book describes the sequence of policy errors committed by powerful, well-meaning people in several countries, which, in combination with the gold standard in place at the time, caused the disaster. In addition, it details attempts to reduce unemployment in the United States by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and in Germany by Hitler's National Socialist economic policies. 
A comprehensive economic and historical explanation of the events pertaining to the Depression, this book begins by describing the economic setting in the major industrialized countries during the 1920s and the gold standard that linked theory economies together. It then discusses the triggering event that started the economic decline--the Federal Reserve's credit tightening in reaction to perceived overspeculation in the U.S. stock market. The policy bungling that transformed the recession into the Great Depression is detailed: Smoot Hawley, the Federal Reserve's disastrous adherence to the real bills doctrine, and Hoover's 1932 tax hike. This is followed by a detailed description of the New Deal's shortcomings in trying to end the Depression, along with a discussion of the National Socialist economic programs in Germany. Finally, the factors that ended the Depression are examined.
This book will appeal to economists, historians, and those interested in business conditions who would like to know more about the causes and consequences of the Great Depression. It will be particularly useful as a supplementary text in economic history courses. 
Thomas E. Hall and J. David Ferguson are both Professors of Economics, Miami University.



Praise / Awards


". . . the fact remains that economists already know quite a bit about why the depression happened and how to prevent it from happening again. As important as further research might be, a still more pressing need has been to convey what is already known to a general public weaned on myths. Hall and Ferguson deserve thanks for addressing this need."--Southern Economic Journal
