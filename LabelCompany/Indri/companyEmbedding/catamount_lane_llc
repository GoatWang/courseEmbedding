About
Catamount Software was officially started by Hardy Macia in September of 1994. Since then, many changes have taken place, but the committment to creating great software and providing world class support has remained the same.
The software Catamount Software has produced has received good reviews. Starting way back in 1995 or so MacWeek rated MPG as one of the top 10 Newton shareware programs. MacWorld has reviewed PocketMoney. MacUser gave honorable mentions to PocketMoney and MPG in the best of Newton shareware category. PocketMoney has also received very good reviews in Pen Computing Magazine.
Catamount Software markets products mainly thru the internet and online services. So, we rely on our customers to spread our products to friends and coworkers that do not have internet connections.
Catamount Software also does custom/contract work. If your company has a project for a mobile application, contact me for estimates and availability.
What is a “CATAMOUNT”? A catamount is another name for a mountain lion. Catamounts are extinct in Vermont, but occasional sightings of these large cats are still reported.
