National Tax Credit Funds









National Institutional Investments 
Since 1992, Boston Capital has been sponsoring multi-investor low income housing tax credit funds for institutional investors, who have invested in nearly $10 billion of equity. These investment funds allow the corporate investor to benefit from the reduced risk provided by national diversification of properties, developers and unique real estate markets.
The typical Fund profile exhibits the following attributes

$100 – $250 million Fund size
20 – 45 properties
Diversification over 10 – 20 states
Partnering with 20 – 30 developers

The Corporate Tax Credit Fund offers

A predictable benefit stream comprised of tax credits and passive tax losses
Enhanced GAAP earnings effect from federal tax credits
Excellent risk-adjusted returns; LIHTC investments have shown the lowest default rate against all other real estate classes
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit for investors
A Socially responsible investment which can be used as a direct reduction against AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax)

The process

Federal tax credits are allocated to each state’s respective housing agency, which in turn award the credits to individual partnerships.
The funds provide equity investment to each of the properties after an extensive due diligence and underwriting process.
Once closed into a fund and leased to qualified tenants, the tax credits flow to the investors through a partnership structure.
Boston Capital’s experienced Asset Management Department then continues to monitor the portfolios through the compliance period.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.  Liquidity  The Fund's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering. Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 or on working capital reserves, (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund has invested and (iii) proceeds received from the dispositions of the Operating Partnership that are returned to fund reserves. These sources of liquidity, along with the Fund's working capital reserve, are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership. The Fund does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships.  The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee.
