              Rob Galford








 
Robert 
              Galford is a managing partner of the Center for Leading Organizations. 
              He divides his time across teaching on Executive Education programs 
              and working with senior executives at the world's leading firms 
              on the leadership issues that lie at the intersection of strategy 
              and organization. He has taught on the Executive Programs at the 
              Columbia University Graduate School of Business, the Kellogg Graduate 
              School of Management at Northwestern University, and most recently 
              Harvard University. 
Rob was formerly a managing partner with the Center for Executive 
              Development. Earlier in his career, Rob was Executive Vice President 
              and Chief People Officer of Digitas (NASDAQ:DTAS), a marketing services 
              firm based in Boston, with offices across the U.S. and Europe. 
He was also a Vice President of The MAC Group and its successor 
              firm, Gemini Consulting, focusing largely on the strategic and organizational 
              challenges facing professional and financial services firms and 
              Fortune 100 Companies. While there, he worked for a number of years 
              in Western Europe prior to returning to the U.S., where he took 
              on a variety of firm administrative and managerial responsibilities. 
            
He has practiced law with the international firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, 
              Colt & Mosle in New York, and has also worked in investment 
              management, first for Citicorp in New York, and later in Boston. 
              In addition, he has taught Management Policy in the MBA Program 
              at Boston University Graduate School of Management.
Rob is a five-time contributor to the Harvard Business Review, 
              including "When an Executive Defects" (case comment-1997), 
              "Why Can't this HR Department Get Any Respect?" (1998), 
              "What's He Waiting For?" (1999), and "The Enemies 
              of Trust" (2003). 
His work also has appeared frequently in the Boston Globe, 
              where he has served as one of the regular "Job Doc" advice 
              columnists in the Sunday Globe, and he has been featured or quoted 
              in such other publications as Inc. Magazine, Sloan 
              Management Review, and The American Lawyer. 
Rob is the co-author of The Trusted Advisor (with David 
              Maister and Charles Green), initially published by Free Press/Simon 
              and Schuster in 2000, and subsequently reissued in paperback by 
              Touchstone/Simon and Schuster in 2001. The Trusted Advisor 
              has been on business best-seller lists since the time of its publication. 
            
His second book, The Trusted Leader (co-authored with 
              Anne Drapeau), was published by The Free Press in January 2003. 
              His third book, Your Leadership Legacy, co-authored with 
              Regina Maruca, was published by Harvard Business School Press (September 
              2006). His most recent book, Simple Sabotage, co-authored with Bob Frisch and Cary Greene, was published by Harper One (September 2015).
Rob currently sits on the board of directors of Forrester Research, 
              Inc., where he chairs the Compensation and Governance Committee. 
              He also serves as an outside board advisor to the noted architectural 
              firm, Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott. He also hosts the 
              business video, Talk About Change! with the popular cartoon 
              character, Dilbert.
His educational background includes Liceo Segre, Turin, Italy, 
              a BA in Economics and Italian Literature from Haverford College, 
              an MBA from Harvard Business School and a JD from Georgetown University 
              Law Center, where he was Associate Editor of The Tax Lawyer.

          The Trusted Advisor
        

    By 
      David H Maister, Charles H Green, Charles H Green, Charles H Green (Joint author), Robert M Galford, Robert M Galford (Joint author)



                Bestselling author David Maister teams up with Charles H. Green and Robert M. Galford to bring us the essential tool for all consultants, negotiators, and advisors. In today's fast-paced networked economy, professionals must work harder than ever to maintain and improve their business skills and knowledge. But technical mastery of one's discipline is not enough, assert world-renowned professional advisors David H. Maister, Charles H. Green, and Robert M. Galford. The key to professional success, they argue, is the ability to earn the trust and confidence of clients. To demonstrate the paramount importance of trust, the authors use anecdotes, experiences, and examples -- successes and mistakes, their own and others' -- to great effect. The result is an immensely readable book that will be welcomed by the inexperienced advisor and the most seasoned expert alike.

Genre: Business


Simple SabotageA Modern Field Manual for Detecting and Rooting Out Everyday Behaviors That Undermine Your Workplace

By:
Robert M. Galford
Bob Frisch
Cary Greene

Performed by:
Tom Parks

 



                Inspired by the Simple Sabotage Field Manual released by the Office of Strategic Services in 1944 to train European resistors, this is the essential handbook to help stamp out unintentional sabotage in any working group, from major corporations to volunteer PTA committees.In 1944, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)‚Äîthe predecessor of today‚Äôs CIA‚Äîissued the Simple Sabotage Field Manual that detailed sabotage techniques designed to demoralize the enemy. One section focused on eight incredibly subtle‚Äîand devastatingly destructive‚Äîtactics for sabotaging the decision-making processes of organizations. While the manual was written decades ago, these sabotage tactics thrive undetected in organizations today:‚Ä¢ Insist on doing everything through channels.‚Ä¢ Make speeches. Talk as frequently as possible and at great length.‚Ä¢ Refer all matters to committees.‚Ä¢ Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. Haggle over precise wordings of communications.‚Ä¢ Refer back to matters already decided upon and attempt to question the advisability of that decision.‚Ä¢ Advocate caution and urge fellow-conferees to avoid haste that might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.‚Ä¢ Be worried about the propriety of any decision.Everyone has been faced with someone who has used these tactics, even when they have meant well. Filled with proven strategies and techniques, this brief, clever audiobook outlines the counter-sabotage measures to detect and reduce the impact of these eight classic sabotage tactics to improve productivity, spur creativity, and engender better collegial relationships.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Trusted Advisorby Maister, David H./ Green, Charles H./ Galford, Robert M.Bestselling author David Maister teams up with Charles H. Green and Robert M. Galford to bring us the essential tool for all consultants, negotiators, and advisors.In today's fast-paced networked economy, professionals must work harder than ever to maintain and improve their business skills and knowledge. But technical mastery of one's discipline is not enough, assert world-renowned professional advisors David H. Maister, Charles H. Green, and Robert M. Galford. The key to professional success, they argue, is the ability to earn the trust and confidence of clients. To demonstrate the paramount importance of trust, the authors use anecdotes, experiences, and examples -- successes and mistakes, their own and others' -- to great effect. The result is an immensely readable book that will be welcomed by the inexperienced advisor and the most seasoned expert alike.ConsultingCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
