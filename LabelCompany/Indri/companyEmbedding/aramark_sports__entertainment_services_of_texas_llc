Insight

                                    As the global health food trend grew, fans at stadiums and arenas across the country were seeking fresher choices in addition to traditional stadium menu options. At Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, our client and team members had an idea—to bring healthier, locally grown options into the stadium while promoting sustainability.

Innovation

                                    Working hand-in-hand with agriculture and landscape students from Colorado State University and the Colorado Rockies, we planned, planted and cultivated a first-of-its-kind sustainable garden outside Gate A of the ballpark. We then took the freshly harvested herbs and vegetables and used them in recipes and salad stations at the ballpark’s restaurant.

Impact

                                    The garden was a hit. Our team at Coors Field was not only building a more sustainable community and future but also providing fans and guests fresher menu options than they would get at a typical stadium. Going forward, we’ll look to continually innovate and improve our food services at all the stadiums and arenas we serve.

Insight

                                    Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver, Colorado is a world-famous outdoor venue continually recognized for its star-studded concert roster and natural acoustics. It's also an important treasure to protect. One of Denver's sustainability goals  is to reduce landfill waste in the city by 20% overall by the year 2020. To help preserve the natural beauty of this venue, our team, along with our client the City of Denver, which owns and operates the amphitheater, are working with Eco-Products® to help increase the diversion rate at Red Rocks. 
                                

See our innovation




Innovation

                                    Working with Eco-Products®, we are now using sustainable food packaging - compostable cups, plates and trays – throughout the venue. The Eco-Products® packaging has a high quality look and feel and are embossed with a special logo reminding patrons that the packaging is compostable. The products can be disposed of in any of the venue’s trash bins and at the end of an event, after the Red Rocks employees collect and sort the waste, it is hauled away to be added to other compostable materials and ultimately turned into organic materials.

Impact

                                    Not all foodservice packaging can be recycled but by using Eco-Products® compostable packing, we are taking another step to keep food packaging out of landfills. With this new relationship, Red Rocks has been able to divert about 75 percent of the waste generated by events.

FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

                                    In a recent study, up to 60% of hospital staff uniforms were found to be contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria and drug-resistant organisms¹. Developing a better way to clean uniforms could lead to fewer hospital-associated infections.

                                    Reducing the spread of bacteria means healthier patients and healthcare providers. With more than 1.5 million hospital-associated infections reported each year, our sanitation process is a step toward a healthier world. This is just one of the ways we innovate the everyday.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.





Will I have the option to act as my own Registered Agent?

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.

Why Thousands of 
Small Business Owners Choose Incfile
Scroll Down






Deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process.

There are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that
can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges. Although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed
below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies.











#1. Value – Nobody gives you more for less!



 .. more


First and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is $49 plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it
for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you. 
Our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has
been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you. 
less












#2. Registered Agent Service - 1st Year Free!



 .. more


Each of our 3 packages include a 1 free year of registered agent service, if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not
obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish. 
After the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of $99. We do not ever under any circumstance
charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment
information.
We only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say 6 weeks or 3
months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making
the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state.
less












#3. Transparency



 .. more


We have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the
order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation
is complete.
On the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity
type have been selected titled "[State] Compulsory Filing Requirements".
We strongly urge you to review this link as many states i.e. Nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the
entity being filed. The link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states
require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax, we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost. 
less












#4. Notifications



 .. more


All of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of
important filing dates regarding their entities. These emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or
franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates. 
less












#5. Internal Documents



 .. more


It is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization /
incorporation with the state. Depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an LLC or the
Directors and Shareholders of a corporation.
We create custom Operating Agreements for the LLLC which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member. In addition we also
create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the Directors and Shareholders as well as the
number of shares that each shareholder owns.
The internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the Statement of the Organizer / Incorporator and
banking resolutions. If changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they
can be customized as needed.
less












#6. Electronic Copies



 .. more


 We know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every
filing in digital format should you need it in the future. 
less












#7. Privacy



 .. more


You can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such. We do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside
business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena.
Although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in.
We also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site i.e. Social Security
Numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed
less












#8. Sales Practices



 .. more


We do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be
knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company.
We only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs. Even though it is much more
profitable for us, we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is
physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in
the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location.
We would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have
detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken. Follow the link for more information regarding this
less












#9. Experience



 .. more


When we entered this industry in 2003, the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today. Through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today.
We have formed well over 100,000 companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence. What
that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in
filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the 50 states.

#10. Humility



 .. more


At the end of the day we know that we are not perfect, we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live
person. However if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to
ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience.
Our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to
man the phones. If you do need to reach us immediately the best way to contact us for a prompt response is to use the messaging tool found at
the bottom right of each page of our site.
