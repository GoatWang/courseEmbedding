BreedIT is the exclusive license holder of the innovative software for agro-breeding solutions. The company has both the software and knowledge to bring science to the growth of legal marijuana.

BreedIT Corp: The Money is in the SeedsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 2 hrs 1 minsS&P 5002,477.50+0.37 (+0.01%)Dow 3021,690.85+77.42 (+0.36%)Nasdaq6,420.01+7.83 (+0.12%)Today's ChartsWhy Facebook earnings could show a big surprise to the upsideBreedIT Corp: The Money is in the SeedsAccesswireMay 6, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareWhitefish, MT / May 6, 2014 / The U.S. cannabis industry is expected to grow more than five-fold over the next five years, from $2.2-2.6 billion in 2014 to an estimated $7.4-8.2 billion by 2018, according to new report by MMJ Business Daily. While growers and dispensaries will likely take the lion's share of the revenue, the highest margin opportunities may be in licensing the seeds used to grow specific optimized strains.Cannabis growers use a variety of different cannabis plants, which are sold to dispensaries and into medical and recreational end markets. Unfortunately, very few of these varieties have a registered genetic background that can provide high-quality and reproducible CBD-to-THC profiles. Medical cannabis breeding in scientific settings is also limited with very little cooperation.BreedIT Corp. (BRDT) aims to solve these issues by breeding and licensing high-quality cannabis seeds through joint-venture partnerships. With its innovative state-of-the-art iBreedIT(R) software and expertise, the company helps breeders cost effectively optimize their cannabis plants and ultimately license them to third party growing operations interested in their genetic profile.In a recent CannabisFN interview, BreedIT Ltd. Chairman and CEO Dr. Sagee provided a brief overview of the enormous opportunity in seed breeding and explained why the company is well positioned in the cannabis market. If the video does not appear below, please click this link: https://vimeo.com/93278122CannabisFN Executive Interview | Dr. Sagee, CEO & Chairman of BreedIT Ltd. from TDM Financial on Vimeo.Initial Partnership UnderwayIn April, BreedIT Corp. finalized its first joint venture agreement with Sheifa Le'Haim, a leading cannabis growing operation in Israel. BreedIT's Chief Scientist, Professor Haim Rabinowitch, will work closely with Sheifa Le'Haim's Dr. Barry Nadel to determine the best and most efficient breeding strategies aimed at developing cannabis seeds with specific cannabinoid profiles.The joint venture will focus its efforts on developing cannabis strains with high CBD-to-THC ratios important for medical indications. While many doctors and patients are interested in ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 20:1, the market produces primarily THC-dominant strains designed for recreational purposes. CBD must be high in proportion to THC to get the best therapeutic effects for medical purposes.Sheifa Le'Haim will use iBreedIT(R) software to optimize both general and floral traits. For example, general traits might include yield, hardiness, and resistance to common pests. Floral traits involve elements like cannabinoid levels, cannabinoid profiles, resin quality, taste, and color. As an experienced, licensed, and certified grower, Sheifa Le'Haim will ensure these new strains quickly make it to market.Shackelford Brings ExpertiseIn April, BreedIT also announced the expansion of its Scientific Advisory Board to include Dr. Alan Shackelford, a practicing physician and expert in cannabinoid medicine. After completing post-graduate medical training at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Shackelford moved to Colorado and established a private practice caring for patients with serious medical conditions using cannabinoid medicines.Dr. Shackelford will be focused on improving the number and stability of cannabis varieties that have distinct medical applications. In particular, he will help identify the ideal CBD-to-THC ratios for various medical indications, which will provide guidance to the joint venture partnerships in developing customized strains and ultimately provide doctors and patients with the best treatment options.An educated and experienced board and management team will back Dr. Shackelford's efforts. BreedIT Corp. Chairman Itschak Shrem's high tech career spans more than thirty-five years in finance and marketing, while CEO Mr. Yoel Yogev is an experienced angel investor that specializes in emerging companies. BreedIT Ltd. Scientific Advisor Professor Haim Rabinowitch also has extensive industry experience heading research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Market for CBD-Rich StrainsBreedIT's focus on CBD-rich strains of cannabis could pay off down the road as medical marijuana becomes increasingly established. CBD is one of at least 60 active cannabinoids identified in cannabis, accounting for up to 40% of the plants extract as a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid. Many believe CBD has a wider scope of medical applications than THC or any other components of cannabis.Read MoreAn orally administered liquid containing CBD developed by GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH), known as Epidiolex, has already received orphan drug status in the U.S. from the FDA for the treatment of dravet syndrome. Cannabis Science Inc.'s (CBIS) CS-TATI-1 is also working on targeting newly diagnosed and treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistance strains of HIV.BreedIT aims to provide its iBreedIT(R) software as a one-stop solution for breeders to cost-effectively develop cannabis products. Through joint ventures with cannabis breeders and alliances with major seed firms, the company aims to establish itself as a leader in the breeding of both recreational and medical cannabis strains, in order to increase quality/consistency and meet the future demands of both end markets.Numerous Catalysts AheadResearch and development surrounding medical cannabis has grown dramatically over the past couple years. According to NORML, more than 60 U.S. and international health organizations now support granting patients immediate legal access to medical marijuana under a physician's supervision, while others like the American Cancer Society and AMA support wide-scale clinical trials.In addition to medical cannabis markets, the legalization of recreational cannabis in Colorado and Washington has led to an enormous expansion of those markets. Legalized cannabis has been tied to lower crime rates, reduced enforcement costs, and higher tax revenue for state and local governments. These efforts could be greatly expanded if the federal government takes action down the road.While some companies, like Tranzbyte Corp. (ERBB) and Next Generation Energy Inc. (OTC:NGMC), are focused on setting up dispensaries and growing operations, investors may want to look towards the seed market for higher margin opportunities. BreedIT Corp. is well positioned to capitalize on the growth in these markets and ultimately unlock significant long-term shareholder value.More Information- Company Website http://ibreedit.com/DisclosureExcept for the historical information presented herein, matters discussed in this release contain forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.

On one hand, cannabis has been used for centuries as a medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. On the other hand, the drug has only recently been legalized by Uruguay and some parts of the United States. The result is an immensely popular industry with very little infrastructure and regulation.The legalization of cannabis has created an overnight spike in demand for infrastructure and regulatory solutions. On the regulatory side, strict requirements on CBD/THC content for medical cannabis has created demand for effective breeding and testing solutions. On the infrastructure side, legalization has created an enormous opportunity for large-scale cannabis cultivation.BreedIT Corp. (BRDT) aims to capitalize on both of these trends with its iBreedIT(R), an intelligent decision support software ("IDSS") for breeders developed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. By helping breeders quickly and effectively to plan, manage and analyze breeding data, the system reduces time to market, eliminates costly errors, enhances product quality, and reduces cost.In the cannabis industry, commercial growers must balance first-mover advantage with producing high-quality cannabis for target end markets. In addition to consistently producing the right mix results it is also important to minimize waste. These dynamics are similar to those in the food industry where premiums for the right seeds are justified by a higher yield and greater product quality at harvest.Innovative TechnologyBreeders commonly spend millions of dollars and several years developing new plant varieties and hybrids. Often times, the process involves tracking thousands of different plants across multiple locations. Despite the complexity, many breeders use tools like Microsoft Excel and lack effective centralization of data, basic planning tools, intelligent decision support and rapid reporting that could make the process much more efficient and almost error free.BreedIT's proprietary iBreedIT(R) IDSS is designed to solve these problems by standardizing the collection of data, making it easily accessible via the cloud, and analyzing the data to extract key data points. Most importantly, the software also eliminates possibilities and advises the breeder on the best path to take. As a result, breeders can avoid crucial mistakes and researchers are able to free up more time to work on important issues and waste less time on mundane tasks, while collaboration across multiple locations is greatly simplified.Many large companies, including a leading breeder of "Daniela" tomatoes, are already using the software in the field. BreedIT will license its software to breeders in exchange for a one-time sale and an ongoing service and support fee or pay per use agreements ("software as service"), which generates high-margin recurring income for shareholders. Over the long-term, the business model could unlock significant value.Transition to a LicensingThe institutionalization of the cannabis industry has opened the doors to entirely new opportunities in the breeding space. For example, regulatory requirements for specific CBD/THC levels in medical cannabis have created a demand for optimized strains of the plant that can be reproduced on a commercial scale. BreedIT's innovative software could help expedite and enhance that process.On April 14, 2014, the company announced a key implementation of its business model with its partnership with Sheifa Le'Haim, an established cannabis grower. Under the terms of the agreement, in the new JV, BreedIT Ltd.'s Chief Scientist Professor Haim Rabinowitch will work closely with Sheifa Le’Haim's Dr. Barry Nadel to determine the best and most efficient breeding strategies, breed unique and hybrid non GMO cannabis strains, and sell seeds or licenses to those strains around the world.The idea of licensing or selling of seeds is nothing new: Companies like Monstanto Company (MON) and Agrium Inc. (AGU) already license proprietary seeds that produce greater yields and are resistant to pesticides in the agricultural industry. The seed industry as a whole is estimated to be worth more than $45 billion per year and legalized cannabis could add significantly more value to the industry.Read MoreInvestment OpportunityBreedIT trades with a market capitalization of under $40 million and stands at the cusp of its commercialization phase. Through its new JV with Sheifa Le'Haim, the company aims to complement its existing IDSS with seed licensing, while its IDSS solutions are starting to gain traction in traditional markets. Investors may want to take a closer look at the stock over the coming months as a result.BreedIT Ltd. has a great management team at the helm working on the underlying technology, including CEO Dr. Oded Sagee, Chief Scientist Professor Haim Rabinowitch of Hebrew University of Jerusalem. BreedIT Corp. is led by Chairman Itschak Shrem, a pioneer of Israel’s high tech industry, and CEO Yoel Yogev, a successful manager and a prominent angel investor in Israel.Dr. Ben-Zion Weiner – a former Vice President of R&D at Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TEVA) – has also joined the company’s board with the goal of directing the pharmaceutical side.All of these individuals are significant investors in the company’s stock, providing them with great incentive to unlock long-term shareholder value.For more information, see the following resources:http://ibreedit.com/DisclosureExcept for the historical information presented herein, matters discussed in this release contain forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.

Cannabis Stocks: Wait For Proof Of Business Concept - BreedIT Corp. (OTCMKTS:BRDT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cannabis Stocks: Wait For Proof Of Business ConceptMar.23.14 | About: BreedIT Corp. (BRDT) Abdalla Al-ayrot Long only, Deep Value, special situationsFollow me on TwitterSummaryBreedIT is a new company in the cannabis industry.It has assets of approximately $3.8 million, but a market cap of $92.29 million due to aggressive issuance of shares by new management.Investors should sell and wait for proof of business concept before investing, as the risk/reward is highly asymmetric to the wrong side.The company has potential, with an experienced management team, but investors should wait for proof of business concept.BreedIT Corporation (OTCQB:BRDT) is a listed company that owns a 66.67% stake in BreedIT, which is a software and hardware provider to breeders. The company has recently changed its name, ticker and core business from ProGaming Platforms Corporation with the ticker PPTF (please note I use the ticker BRDT ticker to refer to ProGaming Platforms Corporation in some parts of article, in order to secure a flow in the article), which was engaged in development of software to the gaming industry (which never got completed or sold to a customer….). I will analyze the history of the company, its executives and business associates as well as the likely future scenario for the company in this article.
The old company
The company was originally incorporated with the name ProGaming Platforms Corporations on May 26, 2010 in the state of Delaware. The company operated from Israel. The company's original core business was the development of an online gaming platform, which it tried to distribute through distribution agents, who first paid the company an up-front fee and afterwards a royalty on every sale. It entered into distribution agreements with two distribution agents; the Luxembourgian GT-SAT International (distribution to Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland; $90,000 up-front fee) and the Israeli company Yanir Levin Ltd. (distribution to Israel; $29,000 up-front fee). GT-SAT International ended their agreement without selling any product. It also seems like a rather odd partner, since the company sells digital TV receivers. The following is a screenshot from their website:


As far as I understand they never actually had any material revenue as set forth in the following screenshot from their recent 10-K:

Keep in mind that $90,000 of the revenue in fiscal 2011 was from the up-front fee from the licensing agreement with GT-SAT International.
BRDT furthermore entered into a Joint Venture agreement with Zenetek LLC, which at the time of the JV was a wholly owned subsidiary of Anything Technologies Medias (OTCPK:EXMT) on February 18, 2013. The stated reason behind the JV was that Zenetek LLC should try to find JV opportunities that could generate revenue for BRDT's "state-of-the-art" multiplayer puzzle game platform in China, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Indonesia for the initial 12 months. The JV with Zenetek LLC has ended.
It's highly relevant to perform due diligence on the company's previous business affiliates and joint ventures in order to detect if any wrongdoing is in the 'blood of the company'. I will start with evaluating its former JV partner Zenetek LLC. According to Zenetek LLC's webpage it's a developer of marijuana apps for iPhone, Android, Windows and Mac. The following is a screenshot from the company's webpage:


This seems rather strange, as how should a Marijuana app developer be able to distribute a mobile gaming development company's products in Asia?
It gets even stranger, as the parent company off Zenetek LLC was EXMT during the tenure of the JV. EXMT operated in the multimedia industry excluding the gaming part of the multimedia industry. EXMT has since the end of the JV pursued a business opportunity in the medical marijuana space, but with big losses.
ML Capital Group, Inc. (OTCPK:MLCG) tried to acquire 51% of Zenetek LLC .The parties have signed a letter of intent on September 9, 2013, but I haven't found any evidence of the transaction having closed. MLCG has since pursued another business opportunity by launching the "SuperStar Vapor Pens".
The new company
As the old game business didn't play out well for BRDT, it decided like its former business associates to pursue a new business opportunity in the medical marijuana space. It announced an 8-K filling describing a deal with another Israel based company called BreedIT Ltd on August 15, 2013. BRDT should invest between $245,000 and $1,000,000 in BreedIT Ltd for a 66.66% stake in the company. The company in later fillings then decided to change its name and ticker from ProGaming Platforms Corporation with the ticker PPTF, to BreedIT Corporation with the ticker BRDT. The following figure illustrates the current company structure:
Dr. Oded Sagee owns the remaining 33.33% of BreedIT LTD. The board and management have changed since BRDT bought a part BreedIT LTD. The following changes have occured:

Mr. Oded Gilboa, age 40, a licensed CPA in the United States and Israel, has been appointed CFO of the company. He has a background in public finance and accounting with over 16 years of experience in these areas. He has held several positions at big US listed companies before accepting the job at BRDT.
Mr. Yoel Yogev has been appointed CEO of the company on January 7, 2014. He has a sales and support background in companies such as Intel, Phillips and IDT. He later established El-Gev, one of Israel's most successful electronic components and sales/distribution organizations.
Mr. Itshack Itrem has been appointed chairman of the board of directors. He has served as Managing Director of Yaad Consulting 1995 Ltd., which was organized in 1995 and provides business development, marketing and investment banking services to a wide variety of Israeli companies.


The company agreed to invest between $245,000 and $1,000,000 although the company didn't have that in cash on hand. As such, the new management and board decided to dilute shareholders by issuing new equity at a low price to themselves and few new investors. This increased the share count significantly. The following table shows the unregistered sales of equity performed by the company, as per its publicly available SEC fillings:

As the table above shows the company has increased its diluted share count, assuming that the company has paid back its convertible notes since the last 10-Q was filed, to 111,197,055 diluted shares outstanding (assuming that all warrants were converted. Note: they are all in the money). This is a considerably higher amount of shares outstanding than financial websites such as Yahoo Finance and Google Finance indicates, which indicates shares outstanding of 52.2 million and 52.3 million, respectively. The company's authorized shares are 500 million, so we might see management continue issuing stock to them in the future.
Valuation
As of the close of March 20, 2014 the company was trading with a market cap of $92.29 million. This valuation is a bit high when taking into account that the company bought its core asset for 1 million a few months ago. Last time the company filed a 10-Q was on November 8, 2013. The balance sheet from the filling is as follows:

The balance sheet shows us that the company's cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2013 was $9.1 thousand dollars. This number is excluding the issuance of equity and warrants. The company has raised a total of $3,854,000 through issuing equity and warrants. This gives us a total of $3,863,000. We then subtract the run-rate deficit that the company is operating at, which is $29,000 a quarter times two and the $1 million investment in BreedIT Ltd resulting in an estimated cash balance of $2,805,000. The run-rate deficit I have used in this calculation is fairly low compared to the company's recent hires, so the cash-balance is likely lower.

So the company has cash of about $2.8 million and a $1 million investment in its subsidiary, totaling its assets at approximately $3.8 million, but is trading at a valuation of $92.29 million, approximately 24.3 times assets. This high valuation multiple presents a large downside if the company doesn't succeed with its business plan. But, let's now try to focus on the potential upside for the company.
Potential upside
First, I have to admit that the management team of the company and its subsidiary has impressive backgrounds with a variety of skills that supplement each other, which is a positive for the company. Second, it's important to thoroughly understand the product and business model of the company. The company provides a so-called "Intelligent Decision Support System" (IDSS) for breeders, which is basically software and hardware that help breeders through their entire process, from the lab to the field. As the company hasn't filed any 10-K filings since it changed its core business, we don't have a detailed explanation of the business and business model in any SEC filings. We will have to use the company's website and management interviews instead.
The company has uploaded a marketing video to the front page of their website, which describes its solution and shows pictures of the system.
According to the founder & CEO of BDRT's subsidiary BreedIT Ltd, Dr. Oded Sagee the company are still in the process of translating its software from Hebrew to multiple languages. The company will be ready start market and sell its product around the world once this translation is done, according to Dr. Oded Sagee. He told us that in a recent interview (link to the slides he uses in the interview) hosted by fellow Seeking Alpha contributor and founder of the cannabis stock investment community 420 Investor (for those of you interested in cannabis investing, Alan provides unmatched and unbiased research and education on the cannabis industry through his community at 420 Investor at a price every investor can afford.)

Dr. Oded Sagee provided us with some very useful information during the interview, which we can use to evaluate the business prospects of the company. He told us that they are in talks with a US group about entering into a potential JV agreement. They are furthermore in pre-mature talks with a Canadian company regarding the possibility of entering into a JV agreement. He also stated that the company is in talks with the biggest medical cannabis grower in Israel. These talks have the potential of turning into great news for the company; if it manages to convert talks to clever deals.
Dr. Oded Sagee furthermore provided us with sales projections, the sales price per solution and the market size. The sales price per solution is around $100,000 and the estimated size of the world market is 50,000 units, according to Dr. Oded Sagee.
The following is his sales projection:

As we can see on the chart above, the company expects to sell 20 units in year 1, which corresponds to 2014 and 1000 units by 2018. This corresponds to a projected cumulative annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 268.4%, which seems a bit too optimistic, when taking the fact into account that the company's team is relatively small with only one guy responsible for sales. However, if the company manages to grow at that rate and charge $100K per unit with an estimated 20% net margin, the company's net income will be approximately $20 millions by 2018, which makes the stock look like a steal with a forward P/E ratio of 4.74.
However, there is a big uncertainty inherent in this projection, as the company is yet to build up an international sales and production organization. Investors should wait for the company to actually sell its products and see if the business model is sustainable, before investing. In other words, wait for proof of business concept before investing.

Conclusion
We have seen a 'Green Rush' so far in 2014, with the Marketfy 420 Investor Cannabis Stock Index rising by 405% in the first two months of the year. For long-term success in investing, investors have to compare the risk with the potential reward. The risk relative to the reward seems too high in BRDT as (1) the business model is unproven, (2) the company is trading at multiple of 23.7 times assets, (3) one of the first thing the new management did when they were hired was to issue stock at a low price to themselves, which has diluted shareholders and (4) a realistic scenario with the company's current organization doesn't warrant such a high price. It will be more prudent for investors to wait for the financials and wait for proof of business concept before investing.
