Founded in 1969, Edwards Wood Products originated in an abandoned chicken house with three workers, Carroll and two part-time employees.  Today it is one of the largest manufacturers of wood pallets in the Southeast, producing more than 100,000 pallets weekly and employing approximately 400 people.  The company is a leading supplier of grade hardwood lumber to the furniture industry and a leading supplier of hardwood and pine chips to the paper industry.

One device in particular improves the patient�s experience during heart transplants by dramatically reducing the number of risky and painful biopsies required and by driving better transplant procedure outcomes.

Carroll Cole was born May 9th, 1938 in Sioux City, Iowa. A scant nine years later, the first of his 16 confirmed victims would be killed. There have been many serial killers over the course of history to examine, but Carroll had two unique aspects that made me want to write about him specifically: he was one of the youngest serial killers ever (based on the date of his first kill), and he is a prolific example of how grandly the legal system can fail not only society, but a single individual.

Cole grew up with a deep hatred of women. This hatred was bred by his mother, whom often took young Cole with her as she had extramarital affairs with men while his father was fighting in World War II. After his father’s return, Cole continued to be beaten and belittled by his mother. She even forced him to dress in frilly skirts and petticoats for the amusement of her friends.

At age nine, he drowned a playmate who made fun of his name, calling him a sissy. He escaped punishment when careless officers dismissed the murder as an accident. In adolescence, Cole accumulated numerous arrests for drunkenness and petty theft. He joined the US Navy after dropping out of high school but was discharged for the theft of pistols, which he used to fire at cars along the San Diego highways. Back at home in Richmond, California in 1960, he used a hammer to attack two couples parked in their car on a darkened lover’s lane. 

Finally, alarmed by violent fantasies that would not let him rest, Cole flagged a squad car down in Richmond and confessed his urges to police.  Carroll surrendered voluntarily and spent the next three years in institutions where he was regarded to “pose no threat to others”. Discharged in 1963, he moved to Dallas, Texas, and married an alcoholic prostitute. In 1970, he once again surrendered to authorities—this time in Reno, Nevada—confessing to his desire to rape and strangle women.  He was transferred to a state hospital, where Dr. Felix Peebles notated his...

...       Coles Group Limited



    The Grocery industry is one of the most important industries in the Australian economy. The industry employs a big proportion of the workforce and is connected to many other industries in the economy environment. Supermarkets are one of the key players in the grocery industry providing around 70% of the value of the retail market for food and groceries.
    The two major grocery chains – Woolworths and Coles – dominate with
 almost 70% market share of an industry valued at A$80+ billion. Over the past 5 years the sector has been witness of some significant developments.
Dynamics were changed after new players like Costco entered the market and ALDI verified a rapid growth since its first appearance in 2001, making colossal to chase market shares by reviewing their campaigns.

		Jonathan Edwards at a Crossroad of Puritanism and Enlightenment

Jonathan Edwards is a fascinating individual in eighteenth century literature and one of the most important figures of his time. He is the son and grandson of Puritan preachers and a product of a Puritan background.  He is known as an Enlightenment philosopher, theologian, orator, and scientist.
 Edwards is a leading figure in the early years of the “Great Awakening”, a period of bringing Puritans back to their former religion and reintroducing old practices, which spread rapidly from Northampton to Massachusetts to Connecticut.  Edwards writing style was shaped by his upbringing and education and strict Puritan influences.  Intense passion and feeling is the driving force behind his writings. The rise and fall in his life as a preacher from being popular to being dismissed is similar to his own personal moments of revelation to moments of utter despair.
Early Puritan themes in writing consisted of practical and purposeful matters.  Puritan writers sought to glorify God by being humble especially in writing.  Rules were very strict and possibly led to Edwards strive for perfection in many aspects of his life.  Edwards “belonged to an elite extended family that was part of the ruling class of clergy”. From a young age, religion was a major force...

                                                But these things also                                            

...﻿But These Things Also

‘But these things also’ brings “to the centre of attention what has previously overlooked”, as Judy Kendall writes. Thomas explores his fascination with the unimportant in this poem and looks at the connection and merging together of Spring and Winter. Much like his other poetry, here, Thomas struggles to put his finger on precisely what he means. This is shown by his inability to separate and distinguish between the two seasons. 
	The poem begins with the first
 two lines focussing on Spring, however, by following this with two lines focussing on Winter, Thomas explodes our first expectations of usual ‘spring poetry’ of bright and beautiful images. Instead,  he catches the limbo between the two seasons and we are presented with the idea of the grass being ‘long dead’ and ‘greyer now’. This pessimistic tone is not what one usually connotes with springtime, but with the cold and bleak winter. By putting the images of the two seasons so close together in this stanza, Thomas reinforces his presentation of their connection. The last line of the stanza, ‘than all the winter it was’, changes the natural syntax of the words. The stress focuses of ‘it was’, emphasising what has past, which creates a sense of longing, introducing the idea that, like in ‘March’, Thomas is desperate to find ‘the key’  the last two lines of the first stanza finish with the words ‘now and ‘was’, bringing together images of the movement of time and emphasising the gap between...

                                                Lewis Carroll Essay                                            

...Lewis Carroll is one of the most well known Nonsense Writers. Though using nonsense in poetry has been dismissed as simply "for entertainment purposes", most nonsensical poetry acts as an allegory, has deep symbolism and leaves the door wide open for varying interpretations. Lewis Carroll has utilized this sense with nonsense  through  his poems and prose found in his novels Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass .  Through Carroll's interactions with
 his close friends and family, and the innovative and eccentric society and politics  of the Victorian Era, he has created beautiful poetry with many different levels.

	The Victorian Era lasted from 1837 until 1901, which was the time during Queen Victoria's reign in England. The term Victorian has "conveyed connotations of prudish', repress', and old fashioned'"(Landow 1). This era is now seen as a time of " great expansion of wealth, power, and culture"(Landow 1). This change in ideas and politics led to great change in democracy, and saw a rise in other modern movements. Since the era lasted for so long it is comprised of several different periods including Socialism, Darwinism, and scientific Agnosticism. The widespread use of opium during the Victorian period may have influenced or been reflected in Carroll's work. "In Carroll's time five out of six families used opium habitually"(Wohl 34). The Victorian Era, ideology, and politics had a great impact on Lewis Carroll's poetry....

...Analysis


What kinds of questions might McGraw-Hill have asked as part of determining the feasibility of the Primis idea? Be sure to address the needs of the organization, end users (sales reps., faculty, and students), IT specialists, and the groups involved in producing the finished custom books.

The questions that McGraw-Hill might have asked regarding the feasibility of the Primis idea would have focused on the importance and on the need of the software, in relation to the
 organizations overall process, IT specialist, and all the groups involved in the process. As implementing the idea would have increased the cost of their processes, therefore, it would have become increasingly important to consider the cost benefit analysis. The questions would have been:

Whether implementing the Primis idea would have increased the benefits for the organization in comparison to the current system.

Whether the quality of the product for the end user would have improved.

Whether the time to produce the products would have reduced, so that the end user would have been able to get the end product in a better quality.

Whether implementing the product would improved the overall efficiency of the IT specialist, as well as, the overall organization.

How well did the systems approach work for the initial stages of the Primis system?

The systems approach sometimes called systems analysis is an interdisciplinary field for the study of objects in their complexity...

...﻿The Oxbow, Thomas Cole
ART 101
Thomas Cole uses an implied line to separate the dark, untouched forest and dark sky with the tranquil, cultivated farmland below.  Cole uses an actual line to outline the banks of the Connecticut River bending through the pastoral land.  Actual lines are also used to define the edge of the horizon in the distance.  He also used actual lines to portray the rows of manicured farmland.     
	The first geometric
 shape I could make out is the triangle of the tiny easel in the middle ground.  Other geometric shapes include the outlines of the pastures and fields.  You see very angular boundaries and rows of plowed fields.  There are plenty of organic shapes as well.  Most notably of course is the shape of the river’s bend but also the more subtle question-mark shape of the birds flying in formation. You can also make out logging scares on the hillsides.  It was later discovered that those scares were Hebrew letters spelling “Shaddai”.    
	Since I am analyzing a painting, mass must be implied. Cole is able to use shading to imply the mass of the storm clouds.  He also paints the glassy river water from bank to bank showing the mass of the river.
Space is created in this painting in two ways.  First, Cole overlaps the cliff on the landscape below.  By his vertical placement of the cliff in the lower corner of the picture plane, he further emphasizes the illusion of space....

...The Origin of Cojuangco’s wealth
“The Cojuangco-Aquinos used and abused all legal means to their advantage and interest of further controlling the lands.” 
– Rep. Rafael Mariano of Anakpawis
Hacienda Luisita Massacre has been a history of the Filipinos. Until now, No one knows who the mastermind of the said incident is. It has been so many years since the incident happen. There are no clear clues on how it was done. The suspects were the owner of the Hacienda Luisita, The Cojuangco’s.
 
According to a group of people that has the aim of opening the eyes of the many in every aspects who uses the name “pinoy monkey pride”, It all began during the 1899 philippine-american war. General Antonio Luna transported all the  wealth of the revolution, millions worth of gold and silver, from Ilocos treasury and governor of Pampanga to a single specific place in Paniqui, Tarlac, The home of his Girlfriend Ysidra Cojuangco.
After 3 days, General Luna was assassinated by Aguinaldo’s officers. Gold treasures of the First Philippine Republic disappeared. Even the American Forces could not find it. In 1900, Ysidra Cojuangco became one of the richest women in the Philippines according to isabelo crisostomo, Cory Aquino’s biographer. Central Luzon was changed since then. Ysidra’s brother has 4 sons which was chosen to inherit Ysidra’s fortune. Cojuangco’s were one of the most powerful and influencial family in the Philippines.
Money was lent to the farmers and the land as the collateral....

The third child born to Laverne and Vesta Cole.While Cole's father was away his mother "enjoyed the company of the other men during her husband's absence, and would require Carroll to visit their homes while she participated in extramarital affairs (Dobbert, 70)."He "was sworn to secrecy under the threats of severe beatings (Dobbert, 70)."As he saw his mother's interactions with men and how they just used her for sex he most likely grew up not respecting women and possibly believing women were only good for sexHe was physically and emotionally abused by his motherHe continued the cycle of abuse, it was normal to himHis mother dressed him in frilly dresses, referred to her son as a girl, and she even teases him about his nameHe was knocked to the ground by a girl and afterward strangled a puppyThis could have led him feeling the need to show his manhood even to the point of him killing womenHe wanted to prove he was a man no matter the cost, to him men dominated women and he was no differentLater on he joined the military and stole gunsIn 1961, Cole told a cop he wanted to strangle and rape a woman to death, he went to a mental hospital diagnosed with schizophrenia/ sociopathic personality disorderBoth doctors said he had a need to demonstrate his manliness as if to prove his genderHe was released from prison labeled as a sexual psychopath, considered dangerous to othersHe talked about his desire to kill and have intercourse with the dead bodies, he told people and they tried to send him to a mental facilityHe attempted suicide but he livedHe was released back into society where he would cause fear and wreak havocSourcesRichmond, J., A.

    We realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used
    for pre-owned vinyl record albums & CD, so we thought we'd offer you the ones that we are working with,
    so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a non-new item on our pages.

Used Vinyl Grades

    Below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at Dusty Groove. Grading for
    the cover should be assumed to be near (within a "+" or "-")
    the grading for the vinyl.
    If there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl, or specific flaws,
    these will be noted in the comments section of the item. However, please be aware that
    since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener, our main concern is with
    the vinyl of any used item we sell. Additionally, please note that all of our records
    are graded visually; considering the volume of used vinyl we handle, it is impossible
    for us to listen to each record. If we spot any significant flaws, we make every attempt
    to listen through them and note how they play.


    The following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single:



Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.
