Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

2 Days In The Life Of Hyatt`s Chief - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



2 Days In The Life Of Hyatt`s ChiefJune 22, 1986|By David Elsner.Recently, Darryl Hartley-Leonard, president of Hyatt Hotels Corp., agreed to allow an outsider to sit in on his meetings and accompany him on his rounds.The result was a rare and fascinating two-day look at how one of the nation`s premier hotel-management chains does business and is coping with some of the fiercest competition it has ever encountered.Here is some of what happened during that period:TUESDAY, 7:10 A.M. Hartley-Leonard arrives for a working breakfast at the Park Hyatt (at the Water Tower) with Peter Underwood, vice president in charge of engineering.A major topic of discussion is the smaller 200-room and 300-room hotels that Hyatt has begun building in the suburbs. Underwood has prepared a list of the staffing requirements for maintenance engineers, but more bodies are on it than Hartley-Leonard wants to pay for.Noting how thin the profit margins are on a smaller hotel property, Hartley-Leonard asks Underwood to combine some job descriptions. Underwood isn`t happy. ``You won`t like the end product,`` he says, referring to the maintenance problems he forsees.``I`d rather go light at the start and add on later than vice versa,``Hartley-Leonard says. ``Once those positions are in the (operating) manual, we won`t be able to get them out for 20 years.`` Underwood says he`ll re-examine the situation.9:32 A.M. Hartley-Leonard takes a phone call from one of the company`s young general managers, who is responsible for an aging hotel. Hartley-Leonard feels the manager, in trying to be ``one of the boys,`` made an inappropriate joke about the condition of his hotel at a recent high-level meeting.About a week earlier, Hartley-Leonard let word of his displeasure filter back, but he has avoided answering the manager`s previous notes and phone messages, allowing him to stew awhile.On the phone, Hartley-Leonard says the company fully intends to spend the money needed to correct the hotel`s situation, but tells the manager his comment was tactless. ``You`ve got to keep your head in the right place,`` he admonishes; morale among employees at the hotel would suffer if they ever heard that kind of comment coming from their boss.After the stick, there`s a carrot. ``You`re doing amazingly well,``Hartley-Leonard says. ``I realize your problem. As for the other matter, it`s over as far as I`m concerned.``11:15 A.M. In the middle of a meeting with memebrs of a production company to discuss a video employee newsletter that Hyatt wants to produce, a telephone call comes in from Hartley-Leonard`s five-year-old son, who has been upset that his father has not been around much lately. Hartley-Leonard has told him that he will take his phone calls any time, no matter where he is. He chats with his son for about five minutes, holding the meeting in abeyance.``He was just testing me to see if I would do what I said,`` he notes.11:51 A.M. A labor relations officer asks for a few minutes` time. There is some confusion about the tack the company should be taking regarding a union representation election at an East Coast hotel.``We will run a normal Hyatt-type campaign,`` Hartley-Leonard says.``There will be no bad-mouthing of the union, nothing showing union leaders with dollar signs coming out of their ears.``12:10 P.M. Hartley-Leonard walks up two flights of stairs to the corporate dining room. He chats from table to table, finding out what`s been going on with others over the course of the morning.1:30 P.M. Hyatt intends to grow not only by physical expansion, but by doing a better job of marketing itself.This meeting with marketing Vice President Joe Garvey and Nan Krump, director of market development, has been scheduled to discuss progress on Hyatt`s planned ``frequent traveler`` program that will offer awards for those staying at Hyatts a certain number of nights and spending a certain number of dollars.In truth, Hyatt has fallen behind the rest of the hotel industry in offering such a program, and Hartley-Leonard notes his general managers complain they are getting hammered by the competition. Marriott, for instance, offers attractive incentives including Caribbean cruises, hotel stays, airline tickets and rental cars.But Hyatt has moved slowly because it is extremely concerned about the``contingent liability`` connected with incentive programs, meaning that those who offer them could have a substantial portion of their net worth wiped out if everyone claimed their prizes. Airlines and hotel companies with bonus programs could be badly hurt if the IRS decides to tax the awards, as it has said it might. Hartley-Leonard has heard through the grapevine that one major airline has $750 million in contingent liability.``We want to make sure we structure our program in the right way,`` he says, ``and we want to know our costs going in.`` That means the company wants to work out some way to encourage its program participants to ``burn off``1 | 2 | 3 |  Next
