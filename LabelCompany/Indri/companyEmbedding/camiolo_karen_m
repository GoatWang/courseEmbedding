Karen M Camiolo's Experience
Title: Controller
               Company: National Fuel Gas Company
Job Details
               Company Size: $1 bil and above - Employee Range: 1,000 to less than 5,000. With nearly 2,000 employees in the communities where we operate, National Fuel is a leader in practicing the highest standards of responsibility in all aspects of its business. We are committed to providing safe and reliable natural gas delivery, excellent customer service, responsible environmental stewardship and productive community involvement. As an integral part of the communities that we serve, National Fuel recognizes the importance of charitable giving. Since 2005, National Fuel, its employees and Foundation have given more than $9 million to nearly 800 charitable organizations throughout the U.S. In 2004, the National Fuel Gas Company Foundation formed to better establish the Company's commitment to the community. As such, we strive to fund innovative programs, initiatives and, on rare occasions, special events, that fall within the pillars of National Fuel's community giving policies, and promise to advance strong, vibrant and stable communities. These pillars, or focus areas, include: Veteran services, education, community vitality/economic impact and the underserved/economically disadvantaged. In 2005, the Employee Charitable Giving Program formed to better align the Company's charitable support with the wishes of our employees. This program is similar to a matching gift program. Employees may choose to designate funds towards 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations and the Foundation will match those funds up to an annual dollar limit. Since the start of the program, employees and the Foundation have contributed more than $7 million. Our Company, its Foundation and employees are proud of our record of generosity through both charitable contributions and volunteer activities in all of the places where we do business. We are proud of the fact that our giving continues to increase. In 2014, employees pledges increased from the previous year, and more than half of the Company's employees elected to participate in the program, pledging more than half a million dollars. Outside of the Employee Charitable Giving Program, the Foundation and National Fuel Gas Company has given more than $3 million to local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations since 2005. The National Fuel Gas Company Foundation is a 501(c)(3) private foundation funded entirely by the shareholders of National Fuel Gas Company.

Job Details
               Company Size: $10 mil to less than $25 mil - Employee Range: 100 to less than 500. Newfield National Bank was originally chartered in 1934 as the First National Bank in Newfield. In 1990, the Newfield National Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company, Newfield Bancorp, Inc. Since its inception, the bank's main objective has been to serve the banking needs of Newfield, as well as Gloucester, Cumberland and Cape May counties. This continues to be the primary driving force behind the bank today. Being one of the oldest and most firmly established independent banks in the tri-county area, the bank has built a reputation of conservative soundness that has served it well. Throughout the years, Newfield National Bank has maintained high quality leadership and personnel, which has helped the bank retain a major share of the local banking market. Newfield National Bank began its operations in a building located at the corner of Salem Avenue and West Boulevard. Operations continued in that location until 1969; thereafter, it moved to our present Main Office location, 18 West Boulevard. The Malaga Branch Office was our first Branch Office to open in September 1969. In December 1969, the Main Office was completed and occupied. Additional branches were opened as follows: Sixth and Landis (September 1974), Star Cross (April 1979), Main Road (March 1982), Little Mill Road (October 1991), East Vineland (October 1995), Williamstown (May 1997), Sewell (June 1999), Hopewell Township Office (May 2001), Seaville (April 2005) and our newest location Washington Township (November 2006). The Operations Center was built in 1989, with the addition of a Loan Center in February 1996.
