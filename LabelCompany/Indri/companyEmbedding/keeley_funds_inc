Investment Objectives
 
KEELEY Small Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through investments in equity securities of companies with a small market capitalization. The Adviser currently defines small market capitalization as securities within the range of the Russell 2000 Value® Index at the time of investment. The market cap range of the index changes daily, and as a result, the capitalization of small cap companies in which the Fund invests will also change.
KEELEY Small Cap Dividend Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and current income through investments in equity securities of companies with a small market capitalization and that currently pay, or are reasonably expected to pay dividends to shareholders.  The Adviser currently defines small market capitalization as securities within the range of the Russell 2000 Value® Index at the time of investment. The market cap range of the index changes daily, and as a result, the capitalization of small cap companies in which the Fund invests will also change.
KEELEY Small-Mid Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through investments in equity securities of companies with a small or mid-sized market capitalization. The Adviser currently defines small and mid-cap market capitalization as securities within the range of the Russell 2500 Value® Index at the time of investment. The market cap range of the index changes daily, and as a result, the capitalization of small and mid- cap companies in which the Fund invests will also change.
KEELEY Mid Cap Dividend Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and current income through investments in equity securities of companies with a mid-sized market capitalization and that currently pay, or are reasonably expected to pay dividends to shareholders.  The Adviser currently defines mid-cap market capitalization as securities within the range of the Russell Midcap® Value Index at the time of investment. The market cap range of the index changes daily, and as a result, the capitalization of small cap companies in which the Fund invests will also change. 
KEELEY All Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through investments in equity securities of companies of any market capitalization and employs a value investment philosophy. The Fund has no restrictions on the size of the companies (small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap stocks) and may concentrate its investments in one of those categories at any time.

Value Approach
A Focus on Restructuring-Driven Change



Our distinctive approach focuses on companies that share these key characteristics:


Restructuring / Change Catalyst
We analyze companies in the midst of major change or transformation to uncover catalysts for value creation.


Complexity / Lack of Coverage
Complex stories with many moving parts are difficult to evaluate, leaving a void in Wall Street coverage.


Attractive Valuation
Lack of research coverage and positive attention fuel investor uncertainty and neglect, creating market inefficiencies.


	          Within our investment universe, we use bottom-up analysis to identify companies with strong business models and solid growth potential.
	        



Value Approach







Value Process Highlight

	        Our research team generates new investment ideas, seeking catalysts for value creation such as:
	      


Ownership Changes
Spin-offs, divestitures, de-mutualizations


Operating Changes
New management, cost cutting, mergers and acquisitions


Balance Sheet/Capital Restructurings
Emergence from bankruptcy, refinancing, shift to “capital lite/franchise” model, capital reallocation


Marketplace Shifts
Regulatory changes, industry consolidation




Value Strategies

Small Cap Value
Small-Mid Cap Value
All Cap Value

KEELEY Funds - Our Story
 
Keeley-Teton Advisors, LLC was formed in late 2016 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teton Advisors, Inc. and served as an acquisition vehicle for the purchase of the asset management business of Keeley Asset Management Corp., a pioneer in small and mid-cap value investing founded by John L. Keeley, Jr. in 1982.  Although Keeley-Teton was a new registrant with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2017, the investment philosophy, staffing, and Chicago location will remain consistent with that of Keeley Asset Management Corp., is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. The creation of Keeley-Teton Advisors, LLC and the resulting combination with Teton Advisors, Inc. has created a transformational combination of two well-established, active asset managers. As of February 28, 2017, the combined firms had $3.8 billion in assets under management (AUM). The complementary investment teams at Teton and Keeley will seek to leverage the resources of both firms to the benefit of fund shareholders, clients and stakeholders. The investment teams at Teton and Keeley-Teton will focus their research coverage across an expanded product suite, including 12 mutual funds (the TETON Westwood Funds and the Keeley Funds) and seven separate account strategies. 
Keeley-Teton seeks to uncover the inefficiently priced stocks of excellent companies through fundamental research. As active investors, we focus on exploiting short-term market distortions to generate long-term alpha.  Its product offerings consist of two distinct, complementary investment strategies - a restructuring strategy and a dividend strategy. The restructuring strategy focuses on companies undergoing major corporate change, which often involves events that act as catalysts and direct our research team toward attractive opportunities. These types of events often share a common thread in that they create market inefficiencies where, for a period of time, there is little-to-no Wall Street research or sponsorship. We believe it is precisely these inefficiencies that offer us a notable edge and allow our team to invest below our fair market value assessment. Specifically, the Keeley Small Cap Value, Small-Mid Cap Value, and All Cap Value strategies represent the restructuring product offerings.
To complement this strategy, Keeley-Teton also offers a dividend product to help investors who seek to minimize the volatility typically associated with small- and mid-cap stocks. In 2009 and 2011, we launched the Keeley Small Cap Dividend Value Fund and Mid Cap Dividend Value Fund, respectively, to focus our bottom-up research efforts on a unique universe of dividend-paying stocks. With this approach, investors access small- and mid-cap dividend paying stocks, which seek to minimize the volatility typically associated with these company sizes. In challenging investment environments, we believe the quality of our dividend-focused portfolios, coupled with our attention to valuation, offers downside market protection and capital preservation.
As an investment boutique, our investment professionals share in the belief that being different is fundamental to discovering hidden value in equities. Our dedicated team is committed to serving clients. From modest beginnings over 40 years ago, to today, The Disciplined Discovery of Value™ shapes the cornerstone for our clients' long-term success.
Dedicated Value Investors for Over Three Decades

Stocks brace for volatility in earnings deluge; Fed meeting looms
              
              With nearly a fifth of earnings reports out, investors are divided on how early corporate reports are serving as an indicator of the overall health of the U.S. economy, and that could contribute to a volatile week as stocks linger near record highs.

Black swans? Here’s why the recent global breakout in stocks should NOT be trusted
              
              If the trend is, indeed, your friend, then more gains are on the way, because everything is breaking out around the world. Last week, nine key indexes busted through to record highs on the same day, including the Value Line Geometric Composite, maybe the broadest global gauge of them all.

Keeley Asset Management Corp. Announces Launch of KEELEY Mid Cap Dividend Value Fund

Oct 05, 2011, 08:02 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Keeley Asset Management Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


CHICAGO, Oct. 5, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Keeley Asset Management Corporation announces the launch of the KEELEY Mid Cap Dividend Value Fund.  The Fund is a newly created series of Keeley Funds, Inc. and is available in two distinct share classes, Class A (KMDVX) and Class I (KMDIX).  
The Fund will be managed using a distinct, value-driven investment style focusing on mid-cap companies that pay dividends. The approach and investment process will complement the firm's highly successful KEELEY Small Cap Dividend Value Fund, launched in December of 2009. Additionally, the focus on dividend-paying companies provides a strong balance to our flagship product, the KEELEY Small Cap Value Fund (KSCVX), and other funds using our time-tested corporate restructuring approach.
"We have been very pleased with the success of the KEELEY Small Cap Dividend Value Fund, and our investment team is confident they will be able to replicate the same success in the mid-cap space. Additionally, in today's volatile investment environment, a company's ability to consistently pay a dividend says a lot about their financial health and stability," says John L. Keeley Jr., the firm's  Chief Investment Officer.  
Thomas Browne, Jr., CFA, will serve as portfolio manager to the Fund. "In my many years of equity research and portfolio management, I recognized a number of important characteristics in dividend paying companies that made many of them attractive investments. Today's market environment has reinforced my belief in the dividend and what it says about a management team and their relationship with shareholders. The payment of dividends is essentially a public exclamation of a company's quality and provides management with a unique form of capital discipline. Lastly, dividend paying stocks have historically performed well in difficult market environments. A critical element in my investment process is to attempt to provide downside market protection," says Browne. 
Mr. Browne will be assisted by Brian Leonard, who has 10 years of investment experience and is also an Assistant Portfolio Manager on the Small Cap Dividend Value Fund. 
The fund is administered by US Bancorp Fund Services, LLC and is distributed by Keeley Investment Corp., a member of FINRA and SIPC.
About Keeley Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO)
KAMCO, founded in 1982 by John L. Keeley, Jr, is a privately owned Chicago-based asset management firm with over $4.5 billion under management.  Today, we serve a diverse client base that includes the institutional community, individual and family trusts as well as the KEELEY funds, an open-ended publicly traded mutual fund family.  
To learn more, please contact Jim Stamper, Vice President, at 312.786.5059.
Investing in small and mid-cap stocks is more risky and more volatile than investing in large cap stocks. Investors should consider carefully the investment objectives, risks, management fees, and charges and expenses before investing. For a current prospectus which contains this and other information, call 888-933-5391 or visit www.keeleyfunds.com.
