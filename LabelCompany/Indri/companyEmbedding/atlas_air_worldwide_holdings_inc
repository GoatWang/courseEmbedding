                    World Business Briefing | Asia: China: U.S. Clears More Flights                
American Airlines and Continental Airlines won permission from the United States to begin passenger flights to China this year and in 2006, the Transportation Department said. A bid by Delta Air Lines failed. The awards, tentative until a 10-day comment period is complete, would leave Delta as the only one of the nation's five largest passenger carriers without flights to China. The Transportation Department awarded cargo flights to FedEx, United Parcel Service, Northwest Airlines and Polar Air, a unit of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings. United Airlines, a unit of UAL, and Northwest Airlines already have passenger service to China.

                    ATLAS AIR NAMES CHIEF TO LEAD IT OUT OF BANKRUPTCY                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. named Jeffrey H. Erickson chief executive, replacing John Blue, who served as chief executive from last March until the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Jan. 30. The chairman, Linda Chowdry, said Mr. Erickson's experience helping Trans World Airlines emerge from bankruptcy successfully would be ''invaluable'' when Atlas Air emerges from Chapter 11 protection later this year. Mr. Erickson is a former president and chief executive of Trans World Airlines.

                    ATLAS AIR DELAYS FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings said it had delayed a planned bankruptcy filing until Feb. 1 to continue to seek agreements with creditors. The company, which owns Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo, also said it expected losses to double this year to $71.6 million from $36 million last year as world cargo shipments declined. The company said in a regulatory filing that it had planned to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, using a recovery plan backed by creditors. Efforts to reach agreements with creditors have been hampered because financial results have not met the company's projections, Atlas said.

                    BIG AIR FREIGHT CARRIER MIGHT SEEK BANKRUPTCY                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., which carries freight for other airlines, said it might file for bankruptcy protection to complete a debt restructuring started in March. The company said it had reached agreement on delaying repayment of about half of $50 million owed to holders of bonds backed by some of its aircraft, and that a majority of the debt holders had agreed not to take actions on any defaults for 60 days. Atlas, based in Purchase, N.Y., said in March that it was halting payments on bank debt, senior notes and leases for 44 planes. Yesterday's agreement involves 12 of those planes. The company also said it would resume payments to its main banks.

                    ATLAS AIR CUTS 30% OF GROUND STAFF BUT MAY LOSE LISTING                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings said it cut about 30 percent of its ground staff, would delay the filing of its annual report and might be delisted by the New York Stock Exchange. Atlas Air has eliminated 170 ground-staff positions -- 65 in Purchase, N.Y.; 32 in Miami; and 28 at other locations; 45 open positions will not be filled -- for a savings of $14 million a year, a spokeswoman, Rachel Berry, said. The company will have 1,275 total workers and 560 ground employees after the cuts, she said. The company, based in Purchase, said that the New York Stock Exchange told it on March 21 that its share price had fallen below the $1 minimum required for listing.

                    ATLAS AIR HALTS PAYMENTS ON BANK DEBT AND LEASES                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, the largest freight carrier for other airlines, is halting payments on bank debt, senior notes and leases for 44 planes while it reorganizes repayment agreements. The company, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, had $930.6 million in debt at the end of 2002, a spokeswoman, Rachel Berry, said. ''We are working with all of our long-term creditors to restructure our obligations in order to reflect the fair market value of our aircraft and the depressed current state of the air-cargo industry,'' Ms. Berry said. The company, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., will continue to pay vendors, she said.

                    ATLAS AIR FIRES ITS CHIEF AND 3 OTHER SENIOR MANAGERS                
Shares of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., the largest carrier of freight for other airlines, fell 11 percent after the company ousted its chief executive and three other senior managers. The chief executive, Richard Shuyler, was removed Thursday, a week after Atlas said the Securities and Exchange Commission began a formal inquiry into the company's restatement of two and a half years of financial results. Mr. Shuyler took over Atlas in January 2001 after the company's founder, Michael Chowdry, died in a plane crash. Atlas, based in Purchase, N.Y., named a director, John Blue, to succeed Mr. Schuyler. The company named Jeffrey Erickson president of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, a week after giving him the job on an interim basis. The company also dismissed Thomas Scott, general counsel, and two senior vice presidents, Fred deLeeuw and Stanley Wraight. The company's stock fell 8 cents, to 63 cents a share.

                    ATLAS AIR TO RESTATE 2001 AND 2002 RESULTS AFTER AUDIT                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. said it would restate results for the last two years, reducing profit in the period by as much as $65 million, based on discussions with its new auditors. Its shares fell 31 percent. Atlas, the largest hauler of freight for other airlines will change the way it accounts for value of inventory, with an allowance for bad debts and maintenance expense. The company estimates that profit will be reduced for 2000 and 2001 and raised by $5 million to $10 million for this year, a spokeswoman, Rachel Berry, said. Stock in Atlas, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., fell 79 cents, to $1.80 a share. Atlas hired Ernst & Young to replace Arthur Andersen as auditor in April, and company employees found the accounting issues a few days ago, Ms. Berry said.

                    ATLAS AIR REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH PILOTS                
The freight unit of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. reached a tentative contract agreement with its pilots and flight engineers, avoiding a strike. Atlas, the largest handler of freight for other airlines, and the Air Line Pilots Association reached the agreement about 90 minutes after a midnight deadline Thursday. They declined to release details of the accord, which must still be voted on by the 631 union members. Negotiations began 26 months ago.











                    Atlas Air to Talk to Union                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and its pilots' union will resume contract talks on Monday to try to avoid a strike that could come as early as June 28.















                    Atlas Air Says Loss Widened in Quarter                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., the largest handler of freight for other airlines, said its loss widened to $6.7 million in the first quarter as shipping declined. The loss of 17 cents a share widened from $1.6 million, or 4 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 37 percent, to $246.2 million, helped by the acquisition of Polar Air Cargo. Hours flown, a measure of demand, at the Atlas Air unit fell 19 percent. Atlas is trying to lure more shipments by switching from providing aircraft, crews, maintenance and insurance under long-term contracts to combining goods from more than one customer on each plane and providing some regularly scheduled flights.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ATLAS AIR IS BUYING CARGO COMPANY FROM G.E. AFFILIATE                
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, a leading carrier of freight for other airlines, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Polar Air Cargo for $84 million to expand into Japan. Polar has routes in key international markets, including Japan, which ''we have sought to enter since Atlas Air's inception,'' Atlas said. Atlas, based in Purchase, N.Y., said it might be able to reduce the purchase cost by as much as $30 million by restructuring leases and selling some Polar aircraft and parts. The seller is an affiliate of GE Capital Aviation Services, a unit of General Electric. The acquisition comes as Atlas and Polar struggle with a drop in demand for shipping services that has led to layoffs in the last few months.

                    ATLAS AIR EMPLOYEES AUTHORIZE STRIKE IF TALKS FAIL                
Pilots and flight engineers at Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings voted yesterday to give their union authority to strike if negotiations with Atlas failed to produce a contract. More than 98 percent of the pilots who voted gave the Air Line Pilots Association approval to strike. Atlas and the union, which represents about 740 Atlas workers, began talks 13 months ago on what will be their first contract. The vote comes as the carrier, based in Purchase, N.Y., is cutting its work force, idling planes and hiring pilots in Britain for lower pay. Atlas said Tuesday that it would lay off 200 workers and earn less than analysts forecast in the second quarter and for 2001 because of declining demand. Atlas shares fell $2.31, to close at $14.46 yesterday.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ATLAS AIR WILL CUT 200 JOBS AND TAKE A CHARGE                
The air cargo carrier Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings said yesterday that it would cut 200 jobs and idle as many as six aircraft at its air-freight unit. Atlas, based in Purchase, N.Y., also said that it expected to miss earnings forecasts because of a drop in demand and would probably break even this quarter and earn 90 cents to $1.10 a share for the year, excluding one-time charges. Atlas was expected to earn 49 cents this quarter and $2.24 for the year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Atlas plans to take a second-quarter charge of as much as $50 million to cover severance and other items. The reduction of 200 ground-crew workers follows the layoff last month of 105 pilots and flight engineers.
