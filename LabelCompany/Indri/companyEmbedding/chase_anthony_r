	Little more than two weeks ago, Tony Chase was on the golf course in Florida with his close friend President Barack Obama, Tiger Woods and Houston Astros owner Jim Crane.

	Today, he's back at his desk as chairman and CEO of ChaseSource, L.P., which provides staffing, recruiting and facilities management services to large companies and government entities. It is a company he formed after selling his ChaseCom to AT&T in 2007. Sweet.

	Beyond his business acumen (he served as deputy chairman and director of the Dallas Federal Reserve), Chase is a force on many levels in H-Town. An honors graduate from Harvard, with both a law degree and an MBA from the Ivy League school, he just completed his term as head of the Greater Houston Partnership and serves as a director of the Texas Medical Center. He is a tenured professor at the University of Houston Law Center and is a director on a number of private company boards and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

	Chase and his wife, Dina Alsowayel, hosted a successful fundraiser for Obama in their River Oaks home prior to his re-election last fall.


What is your chief characteristic?

	Optimism.



The best advice you ever received?

	Play it how it lies. Wisdom from my dad. 



Your idea of happiness?

	My idea of happiness is time with my wife and kids. With my idea of happiness too, other things come to mind, I mean, I walk my 9-year-old son to school every morning. That makes me happy. No matter — rain or snow. No matter what, we walk. It's our thing.



Who are your real life heroes?

	What immediately comes to mind are teachers, K through 12. My dad, who has passed away. My mom. Those are my real life heroes.



You idea of misery?

	Going to the dentist.



Something people would be surprised to learn about you?

	I think it might surprise people that — either one of a few things — that I'm an Eagle Scout and that I held the record for most goals scored in a season at Harvard in lacrosse. How many? It was 34.



What's it like to play golf with the President?

	It's fun. It's wonderful being the President's partner, as I was, because everyone gives him putts. I will say it's a little hard to line up your putt when there're so many guns around. You go into the rough, you go back in the woods, and some guy says, "There it is." It's a little odd. It's a blast really.



What inspires you about Houston?

	It's not just a place. It's a spirit. It's a way of being . . . It's really about a spirit and a way of life — entrepreneurship,  individualism and generosity, all of that wrapped up into one. No one is just sort of passing through. People are here because they want to be here. It's a great place, the best kept secret in the world.



What does it mean to be a true Houstonian?

	It's not about where you were born, it's about who you are and your outlook on life and your belief in principles and the way you live life, your commitment to family, to community and to the civil society, the things that make Houston a great city. When I think of those who are the true, true Houstonians, to me they're Charles Duncan and Bill Lawson.



Who would you like to have dinner with, dead or alive?

Nelson Mandela, Jackie Robinson.

Biography  |




 Interview Date:  3/10/2008 
 CEO of ChaseSource LP and Chase Radio Partners Anthony Ray Chase was born on March 17, 1955, in Houston, Texas, to architect John Saunders Chase and teacher Drucie Chase. As a youth, Chase was a high achiever, a Boy Scout and eventually earned the status of Eagle Scout. He attended Lockhart Elementary School and graduated as class valedictorian. He was then recruited as one of the first African Americans to attend Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia.
In 1977, Chase graduated with honors from Harvard University with his B.A. degree in economics and government. Then, in 1981, he earned his M.B.A. and his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School. Upon graduation, Chase returned to Houston and was hired at the investment banking firm of Rotan Mosley. He then moved to New York City where he worked for the investment firm of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, advising telecommunications and broadcast companies.
In 1990, Chase began teaching communications law and contracts at the University of Houston Law Center, where he has since been awarded tenure. In 1992, he purchased the Dallas-based radio station, KGGR, creating a black gospel radio network. Chase continued to purchase radio stations with formats ranging from country to rap in Texas, Louisiana and California. He then formed an alliance with Clear Channel Communications in San Antonio, Texas. Then, in 1992, Texas Governor Bill Clements appointed Chase to the Board of Regents at Texas Southern University.
Chase went on to found Chase Telecommunications in 1994. However, after three years in the wireless phone industry, he decided to sell his company to a Qualcomm affiliate in 1997. A year later, Chase started Chase Com and began providing both residential and business telecommunications services. Chase Com partnered with SBC Communications and became one of the first agents to offer SBC products and services nationwide. Later, in 1998, in an effort to bridge the digital divide, Chase co-founded the Telecom Opportunity Institute with SBC Communications. In 2000, he became the chief executive officer of Chase Radio Partners. The next year, he co-founded ChaseSource LP to manage the rapidly growing Staffing Solutions Division of ChaseCom. In 2007, ChaseCom was sold to AT&T. Chase is lead director on the board of Cornell, Companies, Inc.; and serves on the boards of Western Gas Partners, LP; Texas Medical Center; and Northern Trust Bank of Texas. He is Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
Chase has received numerous awards and recognitions including: The Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year, Businessman of the Year Award conferred by the Business and Professional Men’s Club, the Lamont Godwin National Achievement Award from the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Outstanding Young Businessman Award from Texas Business Magazine, and Bank of America’s Pinnacle Award.
