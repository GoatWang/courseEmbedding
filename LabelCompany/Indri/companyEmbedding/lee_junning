Description:

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/314,711, filed on Aug. 24, 2001; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention is directed to novel processes for preparing derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics. More specifically, this invention is directed to multi-step processes for preparing derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics having an amino-containing side chain, the steps being conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the intermediate reaction products. 2. Background Glycopeptides (e.g. dalbaheptides) are a well-known class of antibiotics produced by various microorganisms (see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994)). Many synthetic derivatives of such glycopeptides are also known in the art and these derivatives are typically reported to have improved properties relative to the naturally-occurring glycopeptides, including enhanced antibacterial activity. For example, WO 00/39156, published Jul. 6, 2000, describes various glycopeptide derivatives having a heteroatom-containing side chain, including derivatives having an amino-containing side chain. These amino-containing side chain derivatives are particularly useful as antibiotics and as intermediates for producing additional glycopeptide derivatives. Accordingly, a need exists for new efficient processes which are useful for preparing glycopeptide derivatives having an amino-containing side chain. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel processes for preparing derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics having an amino-containing side chain. Among other advantages, the present process is conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the intermediate reaction products, thereby generating less waste and improving the overall efficiency and yield of the process compared to previous processes. Specifically, in one of its aspects, this invention is directed to a process for preparing a compound of formula I:  


 wherein  R1 is selected from the group consisting of C1-10 alkylene, C2-10 alkenylene and C2-10 alkynylene;  R2 is selected from the group consisting of C1-20 alkyl, C2-20 alkenyl, C2-20 alkynyl, C3-8 cycloalkyl, C5-8 cycloalkenyl, C6-10 aryl, C2-9 heteroaryl, C2-9 heterocyclic, —Ra-Cy1, —Ra—Ar1—Ar2, —Ra—Ar1—Rb—Ar2, —Ra—Ar1—O—Rb—Ar2;  Ra is selected from the group consisting of C1-10 alkylene, C1-10 alkenylene and C1-10 alkynylene;  Rb is selected from the group consisting of C1-6 alkylene, C1-6 alkenylene and C1-6 alkynylene;  Cy1 is selected from the group consisting of C3-8 cycloalkyl, C5-8 cycloalkenyl, C6-10 aryl, C2-9 heteroaryl, C2-9 heterocyclic;  Ar1 and Ar2 are independently selected from C6-10 aryl and C2-9 heteroaryl;  wherein each aryl, heteroaryl and heterocyclic group is optionally substituted with 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, halo, hydroxy, nitro and trifluoromethyl, and each heteroaryl and heterocyclic group contains from 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur;  or salts thereof;  the process comprising:  (a) combining vancomycin or a salt thereof, with a compound of formula II:  

 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined herein; and R3 is a amine-labile protecting group; in the presence of a base to form a reaction mixture;  (b) acidifying the reaction mixture from step (a) with an acid;  (c) contacting the reaction mixture from step (b) with a reducing agent;  (d) contacting the reaction mixture from step (c) with an amine, to provide a compound of formula I or a salt thereof. 

In the above process, R1 is preferably C1-6 alkylene. More preferably, R1 is C1-2 alkylene. Still more preferably, R1 is —CH2—. 

 R2 is preferably C6-14 alkyl. More preferably, R2 is C8-12 alkyl. Still more preferably, R2 is n-decyl. 

In the process of this invention, R3 is an amino-protecting group which is removed by treatment with an amine (i.e., a nucleophilic amine). Preferably, R3 is a group of formula (A): 

W—OC(O)—  (A) 

 wherein W is selected from the group consisting of 9-fluorenylmethyl, 3-indenylmethyl, benz[f]inden-3-ylmethyl, 17-tetrabenzo[a,c g,i]fluorenylmethyl, 2,7-di-tert-butyl[9-(10,10-dioxo-10,10,10,10-tetrahydrothioxanthyl)]methyl, 1,1-dioxobenzo[b]thiophene-2-ylmethyl, wherein the 9-fluorenylmethyl group is optionally substituted with 1 to 3 substitutents selected from the group consisting of C1-6 alkyl, halo, nitro and sulfo. 
Preferably, W is 9-fluorenylmethyl, wherein the 9-fluorenylmethyl group is optionally substituted with 1 to 3 substitutents selected from the group consisting of C1-6 alkyl, halo, nitro and sulfo. More preferably, W is 9-fluorenylmethyl. In step (a) of the process of this invention, the base employed is preferably a tertiary amine. More preferably, the base is diisopropylethylamine. In step (b), the acid employed is preferably trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid. In step (c), the reducing agent is preferably an amine/borane complex. More preferably, the reducing agent is pyridine/borane or tert-butylamine/borane. In step (d), the amine employed is preferably ammonium hydroxide or a primary amine. More preferably, the amine is ammonium hydroxide, methylamine or tert-butylamine. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel processes for preparing glycopeptide derivatives having an amino-containing side chain. When describing such processes, the following terms have the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated. Definitions The term “alkyl” refers to a monovalent saturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched. Unless otherwise defined, such alkyl groups typically contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Representative alkyl groups include, by way of example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl and the like. The term “alkenyl” refers to a monovalent unsaturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched and which has at least one, and typically 1, 2 or 3, carbon-carbon double bonds. Unless otherwise defined, such alkenyl groups typically contain from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Representative alkenyl groups include, by way of example, ethenyl, n-propenyl, isopropenyl, n-but-2-enyl, n-hex-3-enyl and the like.

The term “protecting group” or “blocking group” refers to a group which, when covalently attached to a function group such as an amino, hydroxyl, thiol, carboxyl, carbonyl and the like, prevents the functional group from undergoing undesired reactions but which permits the function group to be regenerated (i.e., deprotected or unblocked) upon treatment of the protecting group with a suitable reagent. Representative protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” 3rd Ed., 1999, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y. The term “amine-labile protecting group” refers to a protecting group which is removed upon treatment with a suitable amine. Process Conditions The process of the present invention is conducted in a single reaction vessel in multiple steps. The first of these steps involves combining one equivalent of vancomycin or a salt thereof, with one or more equivalents of an aldehyde of formula II:  


 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined herein, and an excess of a suitable base in an inert diluent to form a reaction mixture. Preferably, from about 1 to about 2 equivalents of the aldehyde are used in this step of the process; more preferably, about 1.1 to about 1.2 equivalents. In this reaction mixture, a mixture of imines and/or hemiaminals is believed to be formed between the aldehyde and the basic nitrogen atoms of vancomycin, i.e., the vancosamine nitrogen atom and the N-terminal (leucinyl) nitrogen atom. 
This first step of the present process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0° C. to about 75° C., preferably at ambient temperature (i.e., about 20-25° C.) for about 1 to about 24 hours, preferably for about 6 to 12 hours, or until formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal is substantially complete. This step of the process and the remaining steps are typically conducted in an inert diluent. Preferably, the inert diluent is N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile/water, and the like or mixtures thereof. Any suitable base may be employed in this step to neutralize the vancomycin salt and to facilitate formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal, including organic bases, such as amines, alkali metal carboxylate salt (i.e., sodium acetate and the like) and inorganic bases, such as alkali metal carbonates (i.e., lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the like). Preferably, the base used in this step is a tertiary amine including, by way of illustration, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, and the like. A preferred base is diisopropylethylamine. The base is typically employed in a molar excess relative to vancomycin. Preferably, the base is used in an amount ranging from about 1.5 to about 3 equivalents based on vancomycin; more preferably, about 1.8 to 2.2 equivalents. When formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal mixture is substantially complete, the reaction mixture is acidified with an excess of acid. Any suitable acid may be employed in this step of the process including, by way of illustration, carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid and the like), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. Preferably, the acid employed in this step is trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid. The acid is typically added in a molar excess relative to vancomycin (and the base). Preferably, the acid is used in an amount ranging from about 3 to about 6 equivalents based on vancomycin; more preferably, about 3.5 to 5.5 equivalents. While not wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the acid selectively hydrolyzes the imine and/or hemiaminal formed at the N-terminal amine of vancomycin in preference to the imine and/or hemiaminal formed at the vancosamine nitrogen atom. This acidification step is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0° C. to about 30° C., preferably at about 25° C., for about 0.25 to about 2.0 hours, preferably for about 0.25 to about 1.5 hours. Preferably, a polar, protic solvent is added during this step including, by way of example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, and the like. Alternatively, a mixed polar protic/non-protic solvent may be used, such as methanol/tetrahydrofuran, methanol/1,2-dimethoxyethane and the like After the acidification step, the reaction mixture is then contacted with a reducing agent to reduce the imine and/or hemiaminal. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed in this step of the process which is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, zinc borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, tert-butylamine/borane, N-methylmorpholine/borane, ammonia/borane, dimethylamine/borane, triethylamine/borane, trimethylamine/borane, and the like. Preferred reducing agents are amine/borane complexes such as pyridine/borane and tert-butylamine/borane. This reduction step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0° C. to about 30° C., preferably at about 25° C., for about 0.5 to about 24 hours, preferably for about 1 to about 6 hours, or until the reduction is substantially complete. Preferably, a polar, protic solvent is present during this reduction step. The polar, protic solvent is preferably added during the acidification step described above. In contrast to prior procedures, the product of the reductive alkylation process is not isolated but the reaction mixture is contacted with an amine to remove the protecting group (i.e., R3) from the intermediate product. Any suitable amine may be used in this step of the process. Representative amines suitable for use include, by way of example, methylamine, ethylamine, tert-butylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, morpholine, ammonium hydroxide, and the like. Preferred amines are methylamine, tert-butylamine and ammonium hydroxide. This deprotection step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0° C. to about 60° C., preferably at about 40° C. to about 45° C., for about 2 to about 60 hours, preferably for about 3 to about 10 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula I is readily isolated and purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation and/or reverse-phase HPLC. The aldehydes of formula II employed in the process of the present invention are well-known in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents. For example, see WO 00/39156, published on Jul. 6, 2000, which describes various methods for preparing such aldehydes. Among other advantages, the process of the present invention provides for improved selectivity, i.e., reductive alkylation at the vancosamine amino group is favored over reductive alkylation at the N-terminus (e.g., the leucinyl group) by at least 10:1, more preferably 20:1. Additionally, because the multi-step process is conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the reaction intermediates, the process of the present invention is more efficient, provides a higher yield and generates less waste then previous processes. The glycopeptide derivatives produced by the process of this invention are useful as antibiotics and as intermediates for the production of antibiotics. See, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/470,209, filed Dec. 22, 1999; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/847,042, filed May 1, 2001; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Additional details of the process of this invention are described in the following Examples which are offered to illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of this invention. EXAMPLES In the examples below, the following abbreviations have the following meanings. Any abbreviations not defined have their generally accepted meaning. Unless otherwise stated, all temperatures are in degrees Celsius (° C.). 

 DIPEA=diisopropylethylamine  DMF=N,N-dimethylformamide  DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide  eq.=equivalent  Fmoc=9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl  TFA=trifluoroacetic acid 

In the following examples, vancomycin hydrochloride semi-hydrate was purchased from Alpharma, Inc. Fort Lee, N.J. 07024 (Alpharma AS, Oslo Norway). Other reagents and reactants are available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis. 53201. Example A Preparation of N-Fmoc-Decylaminoacetaldehyde Step A—Preparation of N-Fmoc-2-(n-Decylamino)ethanol 2-(n-Decylamino)ethanol (2.3 g, 11 mmol, 1.1 eq) and DIPEA (2.0 mL, 11 mmol, 1.1 eq) were dissolved in methylene chloride (15 mL) and cooled in an ice bath. 9-Fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (2.6 g, 10 mmol, 1.0 eq) in methylene chloride (15 ml) was added, the mixture stirred for 30 minutes then washed with 3 N hydrochloric acid (50 mL) twice and saturated sodium bicarbonate (50 mL). The organics were dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvents removed under reduced pressure. N-Fmoc-2-(n-decylamino)ethanol (4.6 g, 11 mmol, 108%) was used without further purification. Step B—Preparation of N-Fmoc-2-(n-Decylamino)acetaldehyde To a solution of oxalyl chloride (12.24 mL) and methylene chloride (50 mL) at −35 to −45° C. was added DMSO (14.75 g) in methylene chloride (25 mL) over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −35 to −45° C. A solution of N-Fmoc-2-(n-decylamino)ethanol (20.0 g) in methylene chloride (70 mL) was added over 25 minutes and then stirred 40 minutes at −35 to −45° C. Triethylamine (21.49 g) was then added and the mixture stirred for 30 minutes at −10 to −20° C. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (120 mL) followed by concentrated sulfuric acid (20.0 g) while maintaining the internal temperature at 0-5° C. The organic layer was isolated and washed with 2% sulfuric acid (100 mL) followed by water (2×100 mL). The organic solution was distilled under vacuum at 60° C. to about 100 mL. Heptane (100 mL) was added, the temperature of the oil bath raised to 80° C. and the distillation was continued until the residual volume was 100 mL. More heptane (100 mL) was added and the distillation repeated to a volume of 100 mL. The heating bath was replaced with a cold water bath at 15° C. The bath was cooled slowly to 5° C. over 20 minutes to start the precipitation of the product. The slurry was then cooled to −5 to −10° C. and the slurry was stirred for 2 hours. The solid was then collected on a Buchner funnel and washed with cold (−5° C.) heptane (2×15 mL). The wet solid was dried in vacuo to yield the title aldehyde. Example 1 Preparation of Nvan-2-(n-Decylamino)ethyl Vancomycin Hydrochloride To a stirred mixture of 20 g (13.46 mmol) of vancomycin hydrochloride and 6.526 g (15.48 mmol) of N-Fmoc-2-(n-decylamino)acetyldehyde was added 130 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and 4.7 mL (26.92 mmol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 15 hours, and 75 mL of methanol and 4.15 mL of trifluoroacetic acid (53.84 mmol) were added at 0° C. successively. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour and 1.93 mL (15.48 mmol) of borane-pyridine complex was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 0° C., and 80 mL (161.52 μmmol) of a 2 M methylamine in methanol was added. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 50 hours, cooled to 0° C., and water (350 mL) was added dropwise. The mixture was acidified to pH 3.60 by slow addition of 11 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and precipitation occurred. The mixture was stirred for another 30 min and then it was filtered through a Buchner funnel. The resulting wet cake was washed with water (2×200 mL) and dried in vacuo for 16 hours to give 9.8 g of crude Nvan-2-(n-decylamino)ethyl vancomycin hydrochloride. Example 2 Preparation of Nvan-2-(n-Decylamino)ethyl Vancomycin Hydrochloride To a 1 L three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a nitrogen bubbler was added 180 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). While stirring, 6.75 g (0.0160 mol) of N-Fmoc-2-(n-decylamino)-acetyldehyde and 25 g (0.0168 mol) of vancomycin hydrochloride were added successively. The addition funnel was rinsed with 20 mL of DMF; and then 5.85 mL (0.0336 mol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine were added. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 6-8 hours while maintaining the temperature at 20-25° C. Methanol (95 mL) was added in one portion and then 5.2 mL (0.0672) of trifluoroacetic acid were added within 1 minute. The mixture was stirred for 0.25 hours and then 1.39 g (0.016 mol) of borane-tert-butyl amine complex were added to the reaction mixture in one portion. The addition funnel was rinsed with 5 mL of methanol, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. tert-Butylamine (10.6 mL, 0.101 mol) was added in one portion and the resulting mixture was stirred at 40-42° C. for about 7 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and 140 mL of 0.5 N HCl were added, followed by 600 mL of a 10% brine solution at room temperature. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 hours at 20-25° C., and then cooled to 10° C. and stirred for 1 hour. The resulting precipitate is collected using a 12.5 cm Buchner funnel by filtering the reaction mixture over a period of about 90 min. The wet cake was washed with cold water (2×50 mL) and sucked dry for 5 hours. The resulting material was added to 200 mL of acetonitrile while stirring to 2 hours at 20-25° C. The resulting slurry was filtered through an 8 cm Buchner funnel and the collected wet cake was washed with acetonitrile (2×25 mL) and dried under house vacuum (about 25 mm Hg) for 13 hours to afford 31.1 g of crude Nvan-2-(n-decylamino)ethyl vancomycin hydrochloride. While the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process step or steps, to the objective, spirit and scope of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims appended hereto. Additionally, all publications, patents, and patent documents cited hereinabove are incorporated by reference herein in full, as though individually incorporated by reference.

Glossary
TermDefinition
Drug PatentA drug patent is assigned by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and assigns exclusive legal right to the patent holder to protect the proprietary chemical formulation. The patent assigns exclusive legal right to the inventor or patent holder, and may include entities such as the drug brand name, trademark, product dosage form, ingredient formulation, or manufacturing process A patent usually expires 20 years from the date of filing, but can be variable based on many factors, including development of new formulations of the original chemical, and patent infringement litigation.
Drug ExclusivityExclusivity is the sole marketing rights granted by the FDA to a manufacturer upon the approval of a drug and may run simultaneously with a patent. Exclusivity periods can run from 180 days to seven years depending upon the circumstance of the exclusivity grant.
RLDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD) is an approved drug product to which new generic versions are compared to show that they are bioequivalent. A drug company seeking approval to market a generic equivalent must refer to the Reference Listed Drug in its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).  By designating a single reference listed drug as the standard to which all generic versions must be shown to be bioequivalent, FDA hopes to avoid possible significant variations among generic drugs and their brand name counterpart.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
