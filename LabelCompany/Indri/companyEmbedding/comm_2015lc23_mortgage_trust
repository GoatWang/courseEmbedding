How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2015-LC23 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





November 02, 2015 01:19 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2015-LC23 Mortgage Trust commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$39,109,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$210,190,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$53,371,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$244,968,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$733,896,000b class XP-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$733,896,000b class XS-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$61,258,000 class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,649,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$43,241,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,828,000a class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94,890,000ab class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,850,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,822,000ab class X-D 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,022,000a class E 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,822,000a class F 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --$10,810,000a class G 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 2, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $22,822,000ab 
      interest-only class X-E, $33,632,147ab interest-only class X-F, 
      $12,012,000a class H or the $33,632,147a class J.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 62 loans secured by 120 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $960.9 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance LLC, 
      Cantor Commercial Real Estate lending, L.P., and Jefferies LoanCore LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 64.2% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 74.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool demonstrates high leverage statistics with 
      a Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.14x and 108.5%, respectively. The 2015 year 
      to-date average Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.19x and 109.4%, respectively. 
      Excluding the credit assessed 11 Madison Avenue (7.2% of the pool) and 
      40 Wall Street (0.5% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.11x and 
      112.5%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans have investment-grade 
      credit opinions: 11 Madison Avenue (7.2% of the pool), has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'A-sf' on a stand-alone basis. 40 
      Wall Street (0.5% of the pool), has an investment-grade credit opinion 
      of 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone basis. Excluding these two loans, Fitch's 
      implied conduit subordination at the junior 'AAAsf' tranche is 
      approximately 25.6%, and 'BBB-sf' is 8.9%.
    

      Below Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 10% of 
      the initial pool balance prior to maturity, slightly worse than the 2014 
      and YTD 2015 averages of 12.0% and 12.3%, respectively. Fourteen loans 
      (38.7%) are full-term interest only and fifteen loans (21.8%) are 
      partial interest only. The remaining 33 loans (39.4%) are amortizing 
      balloon loans with terms of five to 10 years.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 14.9% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2015-LC23 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the 62 mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

Approximately $780.3 Million of Structured Securities Affected

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the seven investment-grade P&I classes were 
affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including 
Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed 
debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl 
Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The ratings on the two IO classes, classes XP-A and XS-A 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.1% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 27, 
compared to 28 at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the September 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.5% to $955.6 
million from $960.9 million at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 62 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 8% of the pool, with the top ten loans 
constituting 51% of the pool. One loan, constituting 
7% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured 
credit assessment.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




There are no loans in special servicing and no loans have been liquidated 
from the pool.




Moody's received partial year 2016 operating results for 80% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 118%, 
compared to 119% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
10.0%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.48X and 0.92X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the 11 Madison Avenue 
Loan ($69.6 million -- 7.3% of the pool), 
which represents a portion of a $1.075 billion mortgage 
loan. The total mortgage loan is comprised of 19 promissory notes: 
Sixteen senior-notes with an aggregate principal balance of $764.3 
million and three junior notes with an aggregate principal balance of 
$310.7 million. The loan is secured by a pari-passu 
participation in the fee interest of a 2.3 million square foot 
(SF) Class-A office building located at 11 Madison Avenue in New 
York, New York. The asset is also encumbered with $325.0 
million in mezzanine debt. The sponsor is SL Green, who acquired 
the property in August 2015. The two largest tenants at the property 
are Credit Suisse and Sony, which recently completed the relocation 
of their New York headquarters to the property. As of July 2016, 
the building was 97.6% occupied compared to 97.8% 
at securitization. Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed 
DSCR are aa2 (sca.pd) and 1.43X, respectively.




The top three conduit loans represent 21% of the pool balance. 
The largest conduit loan is the Equity Inns Portfolio Loan ($80.0 
million -- 8.4% of the pool), which is secured 
by a pari-passu participation in a cross-collateralized 
portfolio consisting of 15 limited-service and six extended-stay 
hotel properties located across 13 states. The properties contain 
a total of 2,690 guestrooms, were built between 1979 and 2002, 
and exhibit an average age of 20 years. Seven different flags are 
represented within the portfolio which are Hampton Inn, Homewood 
Suites, Courtyard, Hilton Garden Inn, SpringHill Suites, 
TownePlace Suites and Residence Inn. As of June 30, 2016, 
the trailing twelve month occupancy rate, ADR and RevPAR were 75.0%, 
$117.00 and $87.89, respectively. 
The hotels are managed by Crestline Hotels & Resorts (12 hotels), 
Hilton (seven hotels), and McKibbon Hotel Management, Inc. 
(two hotels). Crestline Hotels & Resorts is 60% owned 
by an affiliate of the Borrower, American Realty Capital Hospitality 
Trust. Twenty hotels have franchise agreements expiring in 2030, 
and one hotel has a franchise agreement expiring in 2029. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 115% and 1.08X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The second largest conduit loan is the 32 Avenue of the Americas Loan 
($70.0 million -- 7.3% of the pool), 
which is secured by a pari-passu participation in a 1.2 
million SF Class A office and telecommunications building located on Avenue 
of the Americas between Walker Street and Lispenard Street in New York's 
Tribeca neighborhood. The property is composed of 51% office 
and 49% telecommunications space, respectively. The 
subject, which was previously known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, 
has undergone approximately $100 million in renovations since being 
acquired by Rudin Management in 1999. The largest tenants are AMFM 
Operating, Inc., Media Dentsu Holdings USA, Inc., 
and CenturyLink Communications. The property was 99.6% 
occupied as of June 30, 2016, the same as at securitization. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 0.92X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization.




The third largest conduit loan is the 1209 Dekalb Loan ($46.0 
million -- 4.8% of the pool), which is secured 
a 127-unit, mid-rise multifamily property located 
in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Unit 
amenities include dishwasher, garbage disposal, and stainless 
steel appliances. Each unit includes washer/dryer hookups with 
machine rentals provided by management for a monthly fee. Property 
amenities include a laundry room, tenant lounge, game room, 
roof deck, fitness center and entertainment center. As of 
June 2016, the property was 88.8% leased compared 
to 99.0% at securitization. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 124% and 0.70X, respectively, the same 
as at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $22,822,000ab interest-only class X-E, 
      $33,632,147ab interest-only class X-F, $12,012,000a class H or the 
      $33,632,147a class J.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 62 loans secured by 120 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $960.9 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance LLC, 
      Cantor Commercial Real Estate lending, L.P., and Jefferies LoanCore LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 64.2% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 74.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool demonstrates high leverage statistics with 
      a Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.14x and 108.5%, respectively. The 2015 year 
      to-date average Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.19x and 109.4%, respectively. 
      Excluding the credit assessed 11 Madison Avenue (7.2% of the pool) and 
      40 Wall Street (0.5% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.11x and 
      112.5%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans have investment-grade 
      credit opinions: 11 Madison Avenue (7.2% of the pool), has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'A-sf' on a stand-alone basis. 40 
      Wall Street (0.5% of the pool), has an investment-grade credit opinion 
      of 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone basis. Excluding these two loans, Fitch's 
      implied conduit subordination at the junior 'AAAsf' tranche is 
      approximately 25.6%, and 'BBB-sf' is 8.9%.
    

      Below Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 10% of 
      the initial pool balance prior to maturity, slightly worse than the 2014 
      and YTD 2015 averages of 12% and 12.3%, respectively. Fourteen loans 
      (38.7%) are full-term interest only, and 15 loans (21.8%) are partial 
      interest only. The remaining 33 loans (39.4%) are amortizing balloon 
      loans with terms of five to 10 years.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 14.9% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2015-LC23 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the 62 mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
