Harsha V. Agadi MBA ’87 Makes $1 Million Commitment to Fuqua




Fuqua students will now receive career coaching and participate in interviews in the newly named Geetha and Harshavardhan Agadi Career Management Suite. Each year, the Career Management Center bustles with the energy of students seeking internships and full-time positions. Approximately 150 companies and 800 recruiters visit campus annually to recruit Fuqua talent, and more than 500 interviews take place in the school's interview rooms. For companies, the Career Management Center is the front door to the school and the place where Fuqua's reputation for top talent across many industries is born.
The Career Management Suite received its new name through a $1 million commitment from Fuqua Board of Visitors member Harshavardhan V. Agadi MBA '87. Agadi's naming of Fuqua's career center suite is apt, given his remarkably successful career. Currently the Executive Chairman of Quiznos, Non-Executive Chairman of Krystal Co., and Chairman and CEO of GHS Holdings, Agadi has spent close to 30 years with food service companies, having worked with Domino's Pizza, Pepsi, Kraft, General Foods, Little Caesars Enterprises, Church's Chicken, and Friendly's Ice Cream Company and continues to have investments in them. He also serves on the board of two NYSE listed companies: Orient-Express Hotels & Resorts and Crawford & Company.
"My MBA education has been critically important in my career development," said Agadi. "I'm pleased to be able to contribute to a space that will play a vital role in launching the careers of Fuqua students."
"Fuqua's Career Management Center is a hub of activity for recruiters, alumni, and students during the academic year," said Sheryle Dirks, Associate Dean for Career Management. "Corporate recruiters visit many different schools as they search for top talent, and we are proud to welcome them to the newly renovated Geetha and Harshavardhan Agadi Career Management Suite."
Born in Bangalore, India, Agadi has ties both to India and here in the United States. Not only does he serve as Chairman of the Board for both Agadi Sunrise Hospital & SKSVMA College of Engineering & Technology in India, but Agadi has also been a generous supporter of student scholarships that help Fuqua attract top international students. The Harshavardhan V. Agadi Scholarship is awarded each year to a promising female MBA student from India.
"Having a diverse student body is essential to providing a well-rounded, enriching experience for all of our students," said Liz Riley Hargrove, Associate Dean for Admissions. "The top prospective students who bring diversity of race, gender or origin are highly sought after by top 10 business schools, and scholarship assistance can make a critical difference in a student's choice of schools. Our ability to offer competitive scholarship packages is essential to ensuring that we build a cohort of high caliber students who will not only excel in the classroom but also learn from one another."
Agadi's $1 million gift and continuing support of scholarships at Fuqua contribute toward Fuqua's $100 million goal in the $3.25 billion university-wide Duke Forward campaign.
"Harsha's support of both scholarship and the Career Management Center touches the beginning and end of a student's experience on our campus. We are deeply grateful for the time, energy and resources he offers the school and the impact he has made through his philanthropy," said Fuqua Dean Bill Boulding. "The leadership support of our alumni builds the school in many different ways, including our reputation among the companies that hire our students."
Harsha V. Agadi lives in Alpharetta, GA, just north of Atlanta with his wife, Geetha, and son, Samir.

Friendly Ice Cream Corp. taps Harsha Agadi to replace Ned Lidvall as CEO





Updated on August 17, 2010 at  9:14 PM
Posted on August 17, 2010 at  9:00 PM





    
        
            
                By Jim Kinney 


jkinney@repub.com






Harsha Agadi was featured on the May 2006 cover of Franchise Times magazine.
WILBRAHAM - Friendly Ice Cream Corp., which celebrated its 75th anniversary in July, has tapped the former head of Atlanta-based Church’s Chicken, as its new chief executive officer. 

	Harsha V. Agadi’s appointment was announced Tuesday afternoon by Sun Capital Partners Inc., the private equity firm that bought Friendly in 2007 for $337.2 million following a long legal battle for control of the then publicly traded corporation. 

	Former CEO Ned R. Lidvall left to pursue other interests, according to a news release. At the 75th anniversary celebration, Lidvall said he was excited about Friendly’s future in a recovering economy, especially the new Friendly’s Express format which will feature smaller restaurants with faster counter service instead of a wait staff. 

	Lidvall came to Friendly Ice Cream Corp. in 2008 after being the CEO of Rock Bottom Restaurants Inc., a privately owned company based in Boulder, Colo. 

	Agadi grew Church’s Chicken to more than $1 billion during his five-year tenure. He left in 2009 when the chain was sold, but remained as a board member and stockholder, according to a news release. Agadi was not available for comment Tuesday afternoon. 

	After earning a bachelor’s degree from the University of Bombay, Agadi moved to the United States in 1984, where he earned a master’s of business administration at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. He began his food service career focused on pizza, with positions at Pizza Hut, Domino’s and Little Caesar’s. 

	“Harsha has an outstanding track record of helping classic American brands reach their full potential through tightly focused concept evolution and strategic growth,” said Chris Metz, managing director of Sun Capital Partners in a prepared news release. “We are confident that his insight, skills and experience will take this beloved brand to the next level.” 

	Brothers S. Prestley Blake, now 95, and Curtis L. Blake, now 93, founded Friendly’s in Springfield in 1935. 

	The Blakes sold Friendly’s to Hershey Foods in 1979 for $164 million. Hershey later sold it, and in 1997 then-CEO Donald N. Smith took the company public. But S. Prestley Blake felt Smith was mismanaging the company. He started buying stock and filed a lawsuit that took seven years to resolve. 

	In 2007, San Antonio-based investor Sardar Biglari also started buying stock because he felt the company was undervalued. It was Biglari’s demand for two seats on the board that precipitated the company’s sale to Sun Capital Partners.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
