A NURSE with a binge eating disorder has blasted Amazon for selling “tasteless” products emblazoned with slogans mocking her illness.
One novelty laptop case listed by a third-party seller is printed with the phrase: “I have an Eating Disorder, I’m about to eat dis order of fries, dis order of nachos and dis order of wings.”

Nai Cooper, 26, said she came across it while searching for a self-help book on the subject.
The mum of one, of Wonford, Devon, said: “An eating disorder is not a joke.
“It’s not funny, it’s not a slogan for a lunch box or a laptop case and it shouldn’t be used to sell products.
“I have a binge eating disorder which is really hard to deal with at times.
“I was looking at self-help books and this was one of the first things that came up  I couldn’t believe it.

“With eating disorders although the symptoms are physical it’s actually a mental health issue.
“This case is using mental illness to sell products  I was so shocked when I saw it.”
The case was listed on the retail giant’s site until Sunday but appeared to be out of stock.
It has since been removed from the site after Nai’s complaint was highlighted to Amazon.

		Auxiliary nurse Nai Cooper has suffered from binge eating disorder for nine years	

Nai, who works as an auxiliary nurse, said: “I struggle with a binge eating disorder. It’s worse in the winter and is extremely hard over Christmas time when a lot of celebrations centre on food.
“I can’t for the life of me understand why anyone would purchase this or even create it in the first place.
“This trivialises eating disorders. I’m glad it’s currently unavailable but it shouldn’t have been available in the first place.
“As a massive leading online retailer Amazon should be ashamed.”


Bingeing in private leads to guilt and disgust for sufferers


Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious mental illness in which men and women experience a loss of control and overeat on a regular basis.
Sufferers binge on very large quantities of food over a short period of time, usually in private and often when they are not even hungry.
Binges are usually planned like a ritual and can involve the person buying “special” binge foods.
People will often have feelings of guilt and disgust at their lack of control after binge eating.
Unlike those with bulimia, sufferers do not purge themselves after a binge in an attempt to control their weight.
People with the condition may also have low self esteem, depression and anxiety.
Many people with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Source: eating disorder charity Beat


Amazon said: “All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.
“The product in question is no longer available.”
A spokesman for eating disorder charity Beat said: “Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, and every effort must be made to foster an understanding society where the signs are recognised and sufferers’ experiences are not trivialised or dismissed, so that they are able to get help as early as possible.”

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.
