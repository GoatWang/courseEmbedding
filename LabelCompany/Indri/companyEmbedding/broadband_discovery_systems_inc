FTTN is installed by an AT&T Technician. There is no installation fee.

 
Equipment

This service uses AT&T infrastructure and is installed by an AT&T technician, you are required to use an AT&T supplied modem. This will be provided during your installation. See equipment rental pricing specific to your service at checkout. 


You will also receive an Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) for your phone service. The ATA equipment will be shipped to you from Sonic. If you need a phone, any landline telephone will do — here are a few of our recommendations.

 
Contract Terms

All Sonic services require a 12-month contract. Cancellations after 30 days of service will be subject to an early termination fee.

 
For locations within range, add an extra data line to go twice as fast with Fusion X2 for an additional $20 per month. You'll get the same, great features at twice the speed. We recommend a technician installation for X2 connections.






Additional Internet features


Dynamic IP address



Symmetric upload and download speeds


 
Phone Technology

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone service 
Gigabit Fiber service comes with a Voice-Over-IP phone connection. Since it's not a traditional landline, we'll provide an Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) for your phone service to work. Your ATA is a small box placed on the outside of your home that allows you to convert your Internet connection to a telephone connection. Phone service will not work during a power outage, so you can also purchase a battery backup from Sonic for $99 after you’ve ordered service online, or you can order one through another vendor, such as Amazon. See specific battery requirements here.

 
Installation

Standard Gigabit Fiber installation is free of charge for new customers. A Sonic Technician will install service at your home - there is no self-install option.


In addition to our standard installation, customers may also choose a whole-home ethernet installation. 

 
Equipment

We want you to love your Sonic service, so our team has selected the best equipment for your connection with secure firewall protection and high-performing WiFi router. The equipment is fully supported by our award-winning customer care team, which includes necessary technician visits, some inside wiring and jack repair. We'll always replace it for free should you have any issues. See equipment rental pricing specific to your service at checkout.

General
Fusion FTTN
Billing
Help + Support










What's Fusion?





Sonic's fast and flexible residential or small business Internet + phone service. Depending on your location, we offer various Fusion products.Qualify your address to see what services are available to you.







Does Sonic offer any service without home phone?





We think it's important for everyone to have a home phone connection. So, we do not offer any services without home phone at this time.







Does Sonic offer a phone only option?





Yes, this service is called Voice-Only Fusion, and it is only available where Fusion service is available. To learn more, visit the Voice-Only Fusion page.







How fast is Fusion?





Sonic never caps or buffers your connection. Speeds vary depending on what technology is available at your location. Please use our availability tool to check the technologies and speeds available at your address. Bonded Fusion and Fusion X2 can expect up to twice the speed of Fusion.







What is Gigabit Fiber Internet (Fusion FTTH)?





Gigabit Fiber Internet is delivered through fiber optic cables, composed of strands of glass as thin as a human hair. These cables can transmit data at 1000 Megabits per second, which is approximately 100 times faster than the average Internet connection speed in the US.







What's the difference between Fusion FTTN and Fusion FTTH?





Fiber-to-the-Node (FTTN): Fiber service lines are fed to your neighborhood node, then copper service lines are connected to your home.
Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH or Gigabit Fiber): Fiber-optic cables are connected from your neighborhood LCP (Local Convergence Point) directly to an ONT (Optical Network Terminal) device in or just outside your home. What does this mean for you? Crazy-fast, consistent speeds with no limiting copper connectivity. FTTH is only available in certain locations.







What features are included with my Internet + Phone service?





Sonic offers these included features with all Internet + Phone connections.







Is my home security/alarm system service compatible with Sonic VoIP phone service?





Most home security systems are compatible with Sonic's Voice-over-Internet-Protocol phone service. Please contact your home security provider to confirm.











Why can't I use my own modem for Fusion FTTN?





Fusion FTTN is connected using AT&T's network and equipment. So the modem they supply is dependent upon what they require and deploy. Your modem is supplied during your installation.







Is IPv6 supported with Fusion FTTN?





Yes, the FTTN platform supports IPv6.







Can I use my existing phones?





You sure can! Any phone you would normally plug into a phone jack will work with Sonic's phone services. Just plug your phone into the analog telephone adaptor (ATA) we provide, which will be delivered to you via UPS.











How is billing for Fusion service managed?           





Fusion service is billed monthly to a credit or debit card. Recurring monthly service is billed in advance, and any applicable usage charges are billed in arrears. A credit or debit card is required.







Is there a contract?





All Sonic services require a 12-month contract. Cancellations after 30 days of service will be subject to an early termination fee. Fusion FTTN requires a 30 day notice of cancellation.







Where can I learn more about your billing policy?





Click here to read our full billing policy.











I'm having trouble signing up for my desired service. Who should I contact?





Please contact our Sonic sales team at 1-855-757-6111 or email sales@sonic.com – we're happy to help.

Phone Technology

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone service 
Gigabit Fiber service comes with a Voice-Over-IP phone connection. Since it's not a traditional landline, we'll provide an Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) for your phone service to work. Your ATA is a small box placed on the outside of your home that allows you to convert your Internet connection to a telephone connection. Phone service will not work during a power outage, so you can also purchase a battery backup from Sonic for $99 after you’ve ordered service online, or you can order one through another vendor, such as Amazon. See specific battery requirements here.

 
Installation

Standard Gigabit Fiber installation is free of charge for new customers. A Sonic Technician will install service at your home - there is no self-install option.


In addition to our standard installation, customers may also choose a whole-home ethernet installation.
