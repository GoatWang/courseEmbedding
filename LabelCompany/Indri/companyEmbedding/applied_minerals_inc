Advantages:

Biocompatible, non-toxic, and recognized by the FDA as GRAS
Tunable release rates
Increased efficacy times
Shelters active agent from external degradative environment until it is released
Simultaneously performs as a functional filler

 

	Dragonite™ performs as a drop-in additive in paints and coatings to create an unrivaled sustained-release protection against microbial growth and corrosion. Utilizing its inner lumen as a natural reservoir, Dragonite can load, store, and control-release a range of biocides uniformly and in appropriate dosages. The product disperses easily in a wide range of carrier materials and can release single or multiple agents at predetermined rates.  Serving a dual-purpose, the addition of Dragonite also simultanously provides the benefits of a functional filler, dramatically improving mechanical properties.

In addition, Dragonite acts within UV curable systems as an optical fiber to conduct light into the coating to insure proper cure throughout the material depth.

	Dragonite™ provides a UV transparent optical fiber which, when added to a pigmented coating, provides a pathway to help conduct light throughout for an expedited, complete, and even cure. In addition, Dragonite™ also boosts a coating's adhesion due to its unique ability to trap coating impurities, a typical cause of weak boundary layers.

	Key Benefits


		Accelerated cure throughout the coating

		Reinforcement of mechanical properties

		Improved adhesion in systems susceptible to contaminants

		Better scratch and scuff resistance

About Applied Minerals


The Dragon Mine


Sustainability Mission


Our Products






	The Dragon Mine is the only known measured resource of Halloysite Clay in the Western Hemisphere significant enough for large scale commercial production. It is located in the Tintic District of Utah, covering 267 acres of fully owned land with mining permits for extraction of minerals. 

	Applied Minerals Inc developed the Dragon Mine with a clear focus on customer needs and markets. To achieve this, the Company has retained world-renowned experts in Halloysite to create a standard for the characterization, quantification, and commercialization of this unique mineral. As a result of these efforts, Applied Minerals is able to deliver commercially consistent product grades of the highest quality Halloysite in the world.



Underground Resource







 





	 


 
 

Clay
	Applied Minerals’ extensive drilling program continues to explore underground areas of the Dragon property including two mines developed by prior operators as well as one area that had previously remained unexplored.  To date, it has been determined that the collective area contains a Measured Resource of 2,058,128 tons of clay. Extraction of material from targeted areas of this resource is in progress.

Iron Oxide
	The Dragon Mine also contains an ultra-pure iron oxide resource consisting of Goethite and Hematite. To date it has been determined that the property contains a Measured resource of 3,302,275 tons of iron oxide. 

	Further exploration and analysis of the underground resource is ongoing. 

5 Surface Piles





Surface pile on the Dragon Mine property
 
 

	The Company, through its geologic survey, has measured five surface piles on the Dragon property encompassing 4.5 million tons of material which can be processed to create purified Halloysite products. The piles were formed by prior operators (from 1949 to 1976) who rejected the mined clay because it did not meet the criteria for their specific end market.

	The operators abandoned the Dragon Mine in 1976 when they believed all economic and acceptable resources of Halloysite had been exhausted and an ability to purify the surface piles did not exist (now available today). The surface piles were never removed as the operator failed to appropriately remediate the land. Applied Minerals extraction of material from these surface piles provides that overdue remediation, restoring the land to its natural, undisturbed state.

	To date, Applied Minerals has characterized the chemistry and mineralogy of the surface piles and developed a processing system to convert them into purified Halloysite products. 

	 

Production Capabilities






 
 

	Applied Minerals utilizes a dry beneficiation method to process its Halloysite products through a micronizing system located on the mine site. The process utilizes a low energy jet mill without the employment of any chemicals.

	Additional capability through 3rd party partnerships
	- Wet processing
	- Masterbatch production

 


Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - The United States Securities and Exchange Commission permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. We use certain terms on this website (or press release), such as “measured,” “indicated,” and “inferred” “resources,” which the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. U.S. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 10-K which may be secured from us, or from our website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml

About Applied Minerals


The Dragon Mine


Sustainability Mission


Our Products






	Halloysite is an aluminosilicate clay exhibiting a rare, naturally occurring hollow tubular structure. Halloysite tubes have a length in the range of 0.5 - 3.0 microns, an exterior diameter in the range of 50 - 70 nanometers and an internal diameter (lumen) in the range of 15 - 30 nanometers.



	Halloysite is non-toxic and natural - demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment.  It is chemically identical to commonly used kaolin clay (Al2Si2O5(OH)4 x nH2O) with one layer of water molecules existing between layers of alumina and silica. Formation occurs when kaolin sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers. This is a process that occurs over millions of years under extremely rare conditions.

	Applied Minerals markets its line of Halloysite products under the DRAGONITE™ brand name. The Company produces different product grades tailored to enhance the property performance of each target application.


	Versatile Halloysite product grade with a wide range of applications including controlled release, environmental remediation, agriculture, paints and coatings, and catalysts.


	Advanced reinforcing filler used at loadings of 20-50 weight % offering improved modulus, yield strength and HDT. This product grade offers unique advantages compared to other reinforcing fillers such as glass fiber, mica, wollastonite or talc. These include excellent rentention of impact resistance, elongation to break, control over CTE and warpage, and lack of abrasiveness. Flame retardance up to V0 level is also possible when used alone or as a synergist.

Announces Launch of AMIRON(TM) Advanced Natural Iron Oxides Product LineMarketwiredDecember 2, 2013ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Dec 2, 2013) - Applied Minerals, Inc. (the "Company", "Applied Minerals") (  OTCQB :  AMNL ) (  OTCBB :  AMNL ), a leading global producer of halloysite clay and technical grade iron oxides, today announced the commercial launch of its AMIRON™ advanced natural iron oxide family of products produced from its domestic wholly-owned Dragon Mine. As part of the initial launch, four Amiron products are now commercially available on a global basis.Vertically integrated from mine to market, Applied Minerals' Dragon Mine property, located in Utah, USA, has been recently discovered to contain one of the purest in-situ resources of iron oxide in the world. The resource has been independently measured to contain over 3 million tons of Iron Oxide Hydroxide in the form of limonite, goethite and hematite, grading 95% on average and can be selectively mined for a wide range of end uses. Chemically, the iron oxide resource is uncharacteristically low in trace metal impurities, enabling its use in market applications that have been traditionally served by synthetically produced iron oxides.According to research from SRI Consulting (now HIS Inc.), "Characteristics and specifications of natural iron oxide pigments may vary greatly depending on their origin. It is therefore important to mention that there is a class of so-called advanced natural iron oxides, with characteristics that fall in neither of the usual classes 'natural' and 'synthetic' iron oxide. Advanced natural iron oxides are characterized by a high content in Fe2O3; exceptional chemical purity, fine grains and good dispersability; good tinting strength and color saturation; low color variation; and a low content of heavy metals -- they are lead-free."Rogerio Galante, Head of Applied Minerals Iron Oxide Business Unit, commented: "We are excited to commercially launch our AMIRON brand of advanced natural iron oxide products. The market for natural iron oxides has traditionally been constrained due to inconsistent feedstock quality which result in inferior properties as compared to those of synthetic iron oxides. Our AMIRON line of products breaks that paradigm, exhibiting a consistent level of purity and demonstrating performance characteristics that exceed those of competing natural iron oxides."Mr. Galante continued, "We have preliminarily sampled AMIRON to select customers for several targeted applications and have been encouraged by the initial technical feedback. We look forward to penetrating not only the typical natural iron oxide market but also markets that have traditionally been served by synthetic oxides to which AMIRON offers a compelling value proposition."AMIRON Product LinesApplied Minerals has initially launched two product lines: pigments and technical oxides. These include:AMIRON Advanced Natural Iron Oxide Pigments AMIRON™ Pigments are manufactured for use in pigment applications such as roofing granules, ready mix concrete, fiber cement, pavers, bricks & mortar, industrial paints & coatings, animal feed & colorants for plastic and rubber.The AMIRON Pigments line consists of the following colors, all of which conform to standards established by ASTM International, a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of international voluntary consensus standards:  ocher, raw sienna, burnt sienna, natural red, burnt red, raw umber, and burnt umberPremium Grade: AMIRON:ST Semi-Transparent Pigments AMIRON™ Semi-transparent pigments are manufactured for use in pigment applications such as artistic paint, interior & exterior wood stains. Demand for semi-transparent iron oxide pigments is currently constrained, as they are traditionally difficult to stabilize and disperse and very high in cost. AMIRON, in contrast, is a natural cost competitive solution that offers excellent dispersibility, color consistency, and UV protection, all due to its inherent natural characteristics and proprietary processing techniques developed at Applied Minerals' state-of-art facility located at its Dragon Mine property in Utah.Premium Grade: AMIRON:HP FDA compliant pigments AMIRON™ High Purity pigments are manufactured for use in applications such as semi- transparent cosmetics, food contact colorants, and pharmaceutical applications. These industries maintain strict quality requirements, resulting in most suppliers being forced to utilize synthetic products. AMIRON:HP presents a natural alternative that complies with cosmetics industry standards, such as FDA 21 CFR 73.2250 subpart C:Read MoreArsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million Lead (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million Mercury (as Hg), not more than 3 parts per millionAMIRON™ Technical OxidesAMIRON Technical Oxides are advanced natural iron oxide hydroxides, primarily limonitic in nature, consisting of a mixture of iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition with acicular goethite and hematite. The raw ore contains an intrinsically high surface area ranging from 25m2/g - 125m2/g and is micronized to reduce particle size for increased reactivity. Amiron Technical Oxides meet & exceed many of the strict specifications of iron oxides being used today for arsenic absorption from waste and drinking water, as well as for applications currently using iron oxide as an effective desulfurization catalystAMIRON Technical Oxide properties offer: Ultra high purity (mineralogically consistent) Very high surface area resulting in increased reactivity  Significantly low levels of trace metal impurities The AMIRON Technical line consists of the following grades: AMIRON:OH  AMIRON:HApplied Minerals Commercial Production Capabilities & Quality StandardsApplied Minerals' production plant is commercially equipped with fine and ultra-fine milling technologies to consistently produce a range of the highest quality products from batch to batch. The Company's commitment to product quality and consistency is further supported by a strong technical development team utilizing its on-site state of the art laboratory equipped with XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, sedigraph particle sizer, BET surface area, and Data Color color matching equipment.The Dragon Mine contains an iron oxide resource of 3,300,000 tons of distinctive limonite, goethite, and hematite and formations situated adjacent to its Halloysite clay resource. The Company is able to mine iron oxide and Halloysite clay resources independently and synergistically of one another without interfering with the productivity of either operation. Initial processing capacity for iron oxide at the Dragon Mine is estimated at approximately 10,000 tpa with an ability to rapidly expand capacity if demand necessitates.The global iron oxide market was estimated to be 1,350,000 mt in 2012 with growth forecasts of ~3.0% per year through 2017, according to industry research. Approximately 1,175,000 mt (87.0% of the total market) is attributed to pigmentary applications. The market is driven by color demand for construction materials, which accounts for approximately half of the market followed by paints/coatings and plastics. The United States consumed approximately 190,000 mt of total iron oxide in 2012 while importing over 140,000 mt.Applied Minerals will produce AMIRON from its Dragon Mine located domestically in the United States. The Company believes its status as a vertically integrated domestic producer in a country reliant so heavily on imports provides an attractive opportunity to capture import demand. Due the product quality, the company believes that it strong potential to penetrate the global marketplace for iron oxides.For more information on AMIRON products from Applied Minerals, please visit: www.amironoxides.com.About Applied Minerals Applied Minerals is the leading producer of halloysite clay solutions from its wholly-owned Dragon Mine property in Utah.

NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Dec 2, 2013) -  Applied Minerals, Inc. (the "Company", "Applied Minerals") (OTCQB: AMNL) (OTCBB: AMNL), a leading global producer of halloysite clay and technical grade iron oxides, today announced the commercial launch of its AMIRON™ advanced natural iron oxide family of products produced from its domestic wholly-owned Dragon Mine. As part of the initial launch, four Amiron products are now commercially available on a global basis.
Vertically integrated from mine to market, Applied Minerals' Dragon Mine property, located in Utah, USA, has been recently discovered to contain one of the purest in-situ resources of iron oxide in the world. The resource has been independently measured to contain over 3 million tons of Iron Oxide Hydroxide in the form of limonite, goethite and hematite, grading 95% on average and can be selectively mined for a wide range of end uses. Chemically, the iron oxide resource is uncharacteristically low in trace metal impurities, enabling its use in market applications that have been traditionally served by synthetically produced iron oxides.
According to research from SRI Consulting (now HIS Inc.), "Characteristics and specifications of natural iron oxide pigments may vary greatly depending on their origin. It is therefore important to mention that there is a class of so-called advanced natural iron oxides, with characteristics that fall in neither of the usual classes 'natural' and 'synthetic' iron oxide. Advanced natural iron oxides are characterized by a high content in Fe2O3; exceptional chemical purity, fine grains and good dispersability; good tinting strength and color saturation; low color variation; and a low content of heavy metals -- they are lead-free." 
Rogerio Galante, Head of Applied Minerals Iron Oxide Business Unit, commented: "We are excited to commercially launch our AMIRON brand of advanced natural iron oxide products. The market for natural iron oxides has traditionally been constrained due to inconsistent feedstock quality which result in inferior properties as compared to those of synthetic iron oxides. Our AMIRON line of products breaks that paradigm, exhibiting a consistent level of purity and demonstrating performance characteristics that exceed those of competing natural iron oxides."
Mr. Galante continued, "We have preliminarily sampled AMIRON to select customers for several targeted applications and have been encouraged by the initial technical feedback. We look forward to penetrating not only the typical natural iron oxide market but also markets that have traditionally been served by synthetic oxides to which AMIRON offers a compelling value proposition."
AMIRON Product Lines
Applied Minerals has initially launched two product lines: pigments and technical oxides. These include:
AMIRON Advanced Natural Iron Oxide Pigments AMIRON™ Pigments are manufactured for use in pigment applications such as roofing granules, ready mix concrete, fiber cement, pavers, bricks & mortar, industrial paints & coatings, animal feed & colorants for plastic and rubber. 
The AMIRON Pigments line consists of the following colors, all of which conform to standards established by ASTM International, a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of international voluntary consensus standards:          ocher, raw sienna, burnt sienna, natural red, burnt red, raw umber, and burnt umber
Premium Grade: AMIRON:ST Semi-Transparent Pigments AMIRON™ Semi-transparent pigments are manufactured for use in pigment applications such as artistic paint, interior & exterior wood stains. Demand for semi-transparent iron oxide pigments is currently constrained, as they are traditionally difficult to stabilize and disperse and very high in cost. AMIRON, in contrast, is a natural cost competitive solution that offers excellent dispersibility, color consistency, and UV protection, all due to its inherent natural characteristics and proprietary processing techniques developed at Applied Minerals' state-of-art facility located at its Dragon Mine property in Utah.
Premium Grade: AMIRON:HP FDA compliant pigments AMIRON™ High Purity pigments are manufactured for use in applications such as semi- transparent cosmetics, food contact colorants, and pharmaceutical applications. These industries maintain strict quality requirements, resulting in most suppliers being forced to utilize synthetic products. AMIRON:HP presents a natural alternative that complies with cosmetics industry standards, such as FDA 21 CFR 73.2250 subpart C:
Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million         Lead (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million         Mercury (as Hg), not more than 3 parts per million
AMIRON™ Technical Oxides
AMIRON Technical Oxides are advanced natural iron oxide hydroxides, primarily limonitic in nature, consisting of a mixture of iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition with acicular goethite and hematite. The raw ore contains an intrinsically high surface area ranging from 25m2/g - 125m2/g and is micronized to reduce particle size for increased reactivity. Amiron Technical Oxides meet & exceed many of the strict specifications of iron oxides being used today for arsenic absorption from waste and drinking water, as well as for applications currently using iron oxide as an effective desulfurization catalyst
AMIRON Technical Oxide properties offer:         Ultra high purity (mineralogically consistent)         Very high surface area resulting in increased reactivity          Significantly low levels of trace metal impurities         The AMIRON Technical line consists of the following grades: AMIRON:OH          AMIRON:H
Applied Minerals Commercial Production Capabilities & Quality Standards
Applied Minerals' production plant is commercially equipped with fine and ultra-fine milling technologies to consistently produce a range of the highest quality products from batch to batch. The Company's commitment to product quality and consistency is further supported by a strong technical development team utilizing its on-site state of the art laboratory equipped with XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, sedigraph particle sizer, BET surface area, and Data Color color matching equipment. 
The Dragon Mine contains an iron oxide resource of 3,300,000 tons of distinctive limonite, goethite, and hematite and formations situated adjacent to its Halloysite clay resource. The Company is able to mine iron oxide and Halloysite clay resources independently and synergistically of one another without interfering with the productivity of either operation. Initial processing capacity for iron oxide at the Dragon Mine is estimated at approximately 10,000 tpa with an ability to rapidly expand capacity if demand necessitates. 
The global iron oxide market was estimated to be 1,350,000 mt in 2012 with growth forecasts of ~3.0% per year through 2017, according to industry research. Approximately 1,175,000 mt (87.0% of the total market) is attributed to pigmentary applications. The market is driven by color demand for construction materials, which accounts for approximately half of the market followed by paints/coatings and plastics. The United States consumed approximately 190,000 mt of total iron oxide in 2012 while importing over 140,000 mt. 
Applied Minerals will produce AMIRON from its Dragon Mine located domestically in the United States. The Company believes its status as a vertically integrated domestic producer in a country reliant so heavily on imports provides an attractive opportunity to capture import demand. Due the product quality, the company believes that it strong potential to penetrate the global marketplace for iron oxides.
