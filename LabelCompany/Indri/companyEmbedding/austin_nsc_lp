Strata NSC Lumboperitoneal Adjustable Pressure Shunts
Strata® NSC LP adjustable pressure shunts provide treatment for communicating hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).





About the Strata NSC Lumboperitoneal Shunt
 The PS Medical® Strata® NSC Lumboperitoneal (LP) Shunt is used to treat communicating hydrocephalus and may be used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) when shunting is an option. The Strata NSC LP shunt is designed to provide continued cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow from the lumbar subarachnoid space into the peritoneal cavity. The Strata NSC lumboperitoneal valve allows the physician to noninvasively adjust the pressure/flow performance level settings pre- and post-implantation to address changing patient needs.
PS Medical Strata NSC LP valve is sized for subcutaneous placementPS Medical Strata NSC LP valve includes integral lumbar connector and strain relief for easy, non-kinking attachment of the proximal lumbar catheterPressure/flow performance level setting can be adjusted or verified simply and non-invasively in the physician’s office with a hand-held adjustment toolInjectable reservoir domeProximal and distal occluders for selective flushingLatex free

How It Works





How the Strata NSC Lumboperitoneal Shunt Works
The Strata® NSC LP Shunt is a combination of the Strata NSC LP Valve and attached lumbar and peritoneal catheters. The system works by diverting excess cerebrospinal fluid from the lumbar subarachnoid space into the peritoneal cavity.
Prior to implantation, the StrataVarius® Adjustment System is used to adjust the Strata NSC LP valve pressure/flow performance level. Postoperative adjustment of the Strata NSC LP valve can only be completed using the StrataVarius Adjustment System. It is essential that the StrataVarius Adjustment System be available for post-operative patient management.

Important Safety Information
In addition to the risks associated with any surgical procedure, such as bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues, seizures, stroke, or death, the following complications may also occur: obstruction of the system, infection, and mechanical malfunction leading to overdrainage. At times the common complications can provide serious risks and should be treated promptly as such. It is important to review the product labeling for complete safety information, potential complications, contraindications, and a complete explanation of warnings and precautions.

							Lumboperitoneal Shunts
						

Strata NSC Lumboperitoneal (LP) Shunt Systems


							provide continued cerebrospinal fluid flow from the subarachnoid
						

							space into the peritoneal cavity. The Strata NSC Lumboperitoneal valve allows the physician to adjust the pressure/
						

							flow performance pre-and post-implantation to address changing patient needs.  The Strata NSC LP valve is sized for
						

							subcutaneous placement. It features an integral lumbar connector and strain relief for easy, non-kinking attachment of the
						

							proximal lumbar catheter. The Small Lumen Peritoneal catheter includes a small (0.7 mm) inner lumen to preserve distal
						

							shunt resistance, as well as a radiopaque core and translucent wall to minimize tissue contact with barium.
						

Lumboperitoneal catheter systems


							are designed to divert CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space  to the
						

							peritoneal cavity. The L/P shunt systems are comprised of barium impregnated lumboperitoneal catheters, fixation
						

							tabs, and separately available CSF-lumboperitoneal reservoirs. Neither the finished product, nor materials used during
						

							manufacture of product, contain latex.
						

							Valves and reservoirs are designed to allow injection or sampling through the dome using a 25-gauge or smaller
						

							noncoring needle.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
