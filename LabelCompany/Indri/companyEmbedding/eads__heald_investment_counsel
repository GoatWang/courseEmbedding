Are you regulated?

What are your professional affiliations?

Why should I hire Eads & Heald Investment Counsel as my portfolio manager rather than investing in mutual funds?

 Mutual funds can be fine in certain situations. However, with load 
funds your fees can be higher than with no-load funds. Eads & 
Heald's fee is quite competitive with the cost of using the average 
no-load mutual fund. With no-load funds you may not have someone with 
whom to discuss your personal portfolio needs unless your asset size is 
quite large. Also, with mutual funds you have little, if any, control 
over realization of capital gains. Eads & Heald Investment Counsel 
offers personalized portfolio management service and we are always 
directly available to our clients.

 You may wish to further review this topic in "How Client Relationships Work".

What type of accounts does Eads & Heald Investment Counsel manage? 

 Eads & Heald Investment Counsel manages money for ERISA accounts, 
pension plans, profit-sharing plans, defined benefit plans, IRA's, 
family limited partnerships, trust accounts, and taxable portfolios. 
Generally speaking, we manage any investment vehicle for which stocks 
and/or bonds are appropriate. We manage such accounts on behalf of 
corporations, partnerships, municipalities, endowments, foundations, and
 individual investors. 

Where will my securities reside once you begin management of my account?

 Eads & Heald Investment Counsel does not take physical possession 
of any of your assets. Usually, the securities and cash reside at a 
brokerage firm of your choice. You give the custodian written permission
 allowing us to trade assets in your account. 

What options do I have for paying my quarterly fee to Eads & Heald Investment Counsel? 

 We can bill you directly and you send us a check. Alternatively, you 
can have your account set up where we will send our bill to the account 
custodian. The custodian then automatically debits your account and pays
 us by check. In this instance, you will still receive a copy of the 
bill for your records. 

Will you negotiate your fee?

 We do not negotiate our fees. The one exception is when we are 
presented to a prospective client by a brokerage firm as part of a wrap 
fee package. 

What is your minimum account size? 

 Our minimum account size is $250,000. The exception to this is a lower 
minimum in certain wrap fee programs through various brokerage firms or 
other referral sources.

Will Eads & Heald Investment Counsel help me define and implement an overall financial plan? 

 Eads & Heald Investment Counsel is a portfolio management firm.  In addition, Eads & Heald can assist with retirement spending
 and planning goals.  With regard to our investment relationship with 
our clients, we will want to be aware of your overall financial 
situation in order to feel comfortable that the portion of your assets 
that we manage generally makes sense for you. We will prepare a 
Statement of Investment Objectives that addresses the portfolio(s) we 
manage on your behalf.  In this manner, we can assist with common 
financial planning needs to a helpful degree.

Will you obtain my approval before making security transactions in my account? 

 No. Obtaining client approval for trades is tantamount to both client 
and manager managing the account. This process simply does not work. 
Your specific investment objectives will be set forth in a written 
Statement of Investment Objectives. We will abide by those objectives in
 managing your account. However, day-to-day involvement by the client in
 managing the account is counterproductive. 

What input do I have in the construction of my portfolio? 

 We prepare a written Statement of Investment Objectives for your 
approval before we begin managing your portfolio. In your Statement of 
Investment Objectives you can delineate specific companies or industries
 you do not want to own if you so choose. If you have liquidity, income,
 or asset mix needs, those should be addressed as well. Beyond that, we 
need to be free to manage the portfolio as appropriate in an attempt to 
meet your long-term investment goals.  You can revise your written 
objectives anytime.

Can I control when and how much capital gains I realize? 

 In general, it is better to manage a portfolio for fundamental reasons 
and let capital gains take care of themselves. Of necessity, think of 
some percent of your realized capital gains as going toward taxes. A 
portfolio can become convoluted if one has an extreme focus on 
minimizing capital gains. Nevertheless, our investment philosophy lends 
itself to minimizing tax consequences given our low portfolio turnover 
and emphasis on growth rather than dividends. 

How many stocks will I own? 

 The number of stocks owned will depend somewhat on the size of your 
portfolio. In periods where we believe the stock market is "high", we 
may want to own more stocks to achieve greater diversification. Unlike 
many portfolios managed by individuals, we will own many more than five,
 ten, or fifteen stocks. 

What is your investment time horizon?

 We are long-term investors. We look out three to five to ten years and 
longer. If your primary focus is on six to twenty four months or so, we 
would not be a good fit for you. 

What is your asset turnover ratio? 

 Once a new portfolio has been traded to reflect our investment 
philosophy, our security turnover is generally quite low: 15% to 20% 
annual turnover. With a 20% turnover, you are holding the average stock 
for five years. Of course, in reality, you might hold some stocks for 
much longer or shorter periods. Some of our trading is done in order to 
reduce oversized positions caused by certain stocks doing very well. 

Will an individual or team manage my account? 

 Each portfolio will have an assigned manager. All of our portfolio 
managers are working within the same corporate investment philosophy, so
 longer-term results will be very similar regardless of who is actually 
assigned to your account(s). 

How often will you call me and how often will you correspond with me regarding my account? 

 Quarterly, we will send you a formal review letter covering your 
portfolio and our outlook for the future.  We are also available to 
discuss items at any time.  We tend to not initiate calls.  We view our 
clients as busy, smart, and successful people who will call us when they
 want something. 

Do you manage bonds? 

 We do not manage pure bond portfolios, but do manage balanced 
portfolios containing both stocks and bonds. The bonds can be corporate,
 government, agency, or municipal bonds. We are bond "investors" and 
generally do not attempt short-term swapping. We prefer high-quality 
bonds and typically like to stay under 10-15 years in maturity. 

Are you regulated? 

 Yes, we are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC). If you would like a copy of our SEC filing (Form ADV), please contact us. 

What are your professional affiliations? 

 The principals of Eads & Heald Investment Counsel hold the 
Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. All Portfolio Managers 
also hold the CFA designation. We maintain memberships with the CFA 
Institute and the Atlanta Society of Financial Analysts (ASFA). As such,
 we abide by the CFA Institute's Code of Ethics and The Standards of 
Professional Conduct.

What are analysts saying about Illinois Tool Works stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Illinois Tool Works stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "In the last three months, Illinois Tool's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery-General Industrial market. Over the long run, the company’s organic and inorganic growth tactics, its long-term Enterprise Strategy and sound capital allocation schemes will prove beneficial. For 2017, it increased its earnings guidance to $6.20-$6.40 per share. Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2-4%, an improvement over the prior forecast of 1.5-3.5%. Total revenue is anticipated to come within $13.9-$14.1 billion range. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates on the stock increased for 2018. " (7/12/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "ITW hosted an Investor Day in New York this morning and provided initial guidance for 2017. Organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% and 100bps of EBIT expansion from Enterprise Initiatives are projected to yield EPS in the range of $6.00-$6.20 (Consensus at $6.14 on revenue growth of 3%). With a strong history of execution and low drama, we continue to view ITW as a core holding. Bottom Line: 2017 another year of stable growth. ITW’s preliminary forecast for organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% for 2017 compares to current consensus forecast of ~3% but assumes no improvement in end market trends. The guidance includes roughly 50bps of headwind from Product Line Simplification (PLS) actions, lower than the 100bps headwind since 2014-16. ITW’s targeted EPS range of $6.00-$6.20 compares to current consensus of $6.14. Of note: ITW’s 2017 EBIT margin target is 23.5%, 100bps above the 2016 target, and indeed management noted the target could be conservative." (12/5/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 5 Hold Ratings, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.55)Consensus Price Target: $150.45 (2.15% upside)
