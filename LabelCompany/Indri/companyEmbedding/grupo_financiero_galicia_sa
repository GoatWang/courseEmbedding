Dormant Argentina IPO Market Prepares for 2018 Awakening (1)Carolina MillanJul 16, 2017 7:08 pm ET(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s IPO market hasn’t had quite the jolt some investors were expecting.  A year and a half after President Mauricio Macri took office, new share sales are slow to take off. Just one company has completed an international initial public offering. The delay comes as private companies wait for their valuations to rise, while taking advantage of their low leverage: Argentine corporates sold about $10 billion in debt over the past 18 months while Merval index valuations are trading at a relatively low level versus their MSCI emerging market peers."Issuers are looking to see if their valuations are the highest they can be," said Daniel Patron Costas, head of investment banking at Banco Santander Rio SA. "The IPO boom might not be in 2017, but 2018 should be the key year."About a dozen new share offerings are expected over the next 18 months, mostly in 2018, and in particular in the energy, infrastructure and agribusiness sectors, he added. Santander Rio’s investment banking unit headcount rose "significantly" in the past year and may continue to grow as activity rises.Follow-ons GaloreInvestors are moving past the disappointment after MSCI Inc. last month delayed a decision on whether to upgrade Argentina to emerging market status by at least a year, saying that it needed confirmation that reforms were "irreversible," despite Macri having already removed capital controls. Analysts at five investment banks from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Credit Suisse Group AG had forecast the country would be included in the index."I think there was a lot of eagerness on Argentina," said Ricardo Cavanagh, head of equity research at Banco Itau Argentina SA. "Of course it would be great to be included in the index, but ultimately the decision doesn’t change the fundamentals, so we’ll be patient."The evidence of improving fundamentals may be found in follow-on stock sales rather than the one IPO during Macri’s tenure.That one new offering came when Grupo Supervielle SA snapped Argentina’s two-year IPO drought in June 2016, raising $280 million in New York and Buenos Aires. In local follow-ons, alfajor-maker Havanna Holding SA raised $10 million and lemon exporter SA San Miguel AGICI y F kicked off 2017 with a 706 million peso ($40 million) sale. The difference in size between local and international transactions remains a test for some issuers, Patron Costas added."One challenge issuers face is that a $200 million equity sale is small for international investors but it’s too large for the local market," said Patron Costas, who was part of the consortium that arranged San Miguel’s follow-on sale. "As the local market grows and the two markets converge, we’ll see new issuance volume pick up."Banking OpportunitiesBanco Macro SA also raised $766 million from a follow-on sale and BBVA Banco Frances SA is in the middle of a roadshow to sell as many as 95 million new shares on July 18. Ahead of a final deadline, the two banks were among bidders for Banco do Brasil SA’s stake of Banco Patagonia SA."The banks are seeing a strong need to be prepared ahead of a growth stage," Cavanagh said. "The industry is expected to grow by volume, so players will need to look for scale if they want to compete. That’s driving some of the new activity-- the Banco Macro deal was huge for Argentina."Grupo Financiero Galicia SA plans to propose a new offering of as many as 150 million new class B shares at a shareholder meeting to be held August 15. Grupo Supervielle got shareholder approval to sell 145 million new shares after a shareholder meeting held July 7.In the months ahead, investor focus will shift to watching midterm elections in Argentina, which will serve to signal "the sustainability of the ongoing policy changes," according to a JPMorgan report."A positive outcome could reduce uncertainty regarding policy continuation in the country and consequently allow a further re-rating of the market, in our view," the analysts wrote, adding they are overweight Argentina in Latin America.(Updates to add Grupo Galicia new share offering proposal in twelfth paragraph.)--With assistance from Shin Pei ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Sprint's new leasing plans deliver annual upgrades to all
Judith Bessette
Julho 14, 2017



Ação












Once you reach the 18-month mark, you can return your device and upgrade to a new one, purchase the phone by making one final lump payment, or purchase the phone and make six more monthly payments. The annual upgrade programs Galaxy Forever (and iPhone Forever) are included in the program.
Sprint is also unveiling a "value menu" of cheap smartphones for users to choose from if they're looking more affordable phones with Sprint Deals, which can offer different discounts depending on your credit, and you're still eligible for an annual upgrade if you pay on-time. It's a lease program that gives you the option to upgrade yearly or at 18 months if you want, but it also allows you to decide to keep the phone and pay it off in a couple of ways. The option to pay $5 per month to upgrade every year is a nice option for folks that love to get new phones, but if you're not interested in adding to your monthly bill, you can wait a few more months and upgrade at no extra charge.


Remains Found In Cold Case Involving Saxonburg Police Chief
Webb is a fugitive from justice and is wanted in connection for the unsolved murder of Saxonburg Police Chief Gregory Adams . A cane was reportedly found in that room, and it is believed Chief Adams was able to shoot Webb in the leg.
Well, Sprint wants to keep you from committing completely to a phone you might despise with its new financing plan, Sprint Flex.For entry-level devices, customers pay $5 per month with $25 down. Meanwhile, customers who skip a credit check can get half off the price of an entry-level phone or 25 percent off a higher-end device on a prepaid plan.

Grupo Financiero Galicia is a financial services holding company based in Buenos Aires,[3] and its banking operations are the fifth largest in Argentina, as well as the largest among all domestically-owned private banks in the country.[4]
Overview[edit]
The bank was founded in 1905 as the Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires by a consortium led by Manuel Escasany, a jeweler and clock maker of Galician origin. The name referred to the Galician heritage of the Escasanys, the largest original shareholders,[5] as well as to the Spanish Argentine immigrant community from that region (who were second only to Italian Argentines in number).[6]




The original headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires.






New headquarters.


The bank maintained over 2,500 accounts by the end of its first year, and in 1907, it was listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange and garnered nearly 3,300 initial shareholders. The Buenos Aires branches were followed by one in neighboring Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1910, and in 1921, it began offering time deposits (which remain the most common form of savings among the Argentine public).[5]
Following the founder's death in 1948, his son, Eduardo Escasany, became its president and by 1960, he had secured a partnership with the Ayerzas and the Brauns, two influential local families prominent in the Argentine ranching and retail sectors, respectively. The Banco de Galicia became the largest, domestically-owned private bank in Argentina in 1965 and by 1975, ranked second to the public National Mortgage Bank in new home loans, and employed around 3,900 staff in 93 branches, nationwide. Banco de Galicia in 1993 became the first Latin American bank to enter both the U.S. and European stock markets, and the first to raise funds on the U.S. domestic capital market by floating a $200 million, ten-year Yankee bond. The following year it was the first to issue convertible bonds on the international securities market, enabling the bank to remain in Argentine hands at a time when many of its rivals were sold to Spanish banks. A branch was opened in New York in 1994, and the group acquired a one-eighth share in the newly privatized postal service. Banco Galicia established an insurance company, Sudamericana Holding S.A., in 1996 as a joint venture with The Hartford.[5]
The company's decision in 2000 to demolish its historic downtown Buenos Aires headquarters in favor of a modern, 34-story building met with controversy, though the new offices were later completed.[7][8] A family feud among the Escasany siblings led to the establishment in 2000 of the Banco de Galicia Foundation, which owns over 94% of the outstanding shares of Banco Galicia. Though a sell-off of public shares was averted, given the controversy, the Argentine economic crisis led to the loss of nearly half of the bank's deposits between 2001 and 2002, and to its near-insolvency, when its dollar-denominated debt of US$1.8 billion required borrowing on flexible terms from the Central Bank of Argentina; Escasany, who had also been chairman of the Argentine Banking Association, resigned as CEO in 2002. The bank recovered during 2003, however, when its losses of US$436 million were trimmed to US$73 million, and it has remained profitable in the ensuing years.[5]
The façade and engineering for the new building was provided by Obras Metálicas S. A.
The bank remains the largest private sector commercial bank in Argentina ranked by deposits, assets or loans. As of April 2009, the group maintained 236 branches and total deposits in Argentina amounted to nearly US$ 4.5 billion, a 6% market share, and 7.6% among private sector depositors.[4] Consolidated assets totaled US$ 7.7 billion and loans to the private sector, US$ 3.7 billion (6.5% of the market).[4][9]
Besides its holdings in Banco Galicia, GFG participates in other business sectors through four companies: Grupo Sudamericana, an insurance holding company specialized in life, retirement, and hemeowner's policies; Galicia Warrants S.A., a warehouse rental services and issuer of certificate of deposits company; Net Investment, a holding company oriented to invest in Internet projects that can have synergies with Banco Galicia; and Galval Agente de Valores S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of GFG, based in Uruguay and created with the purpose of providing custody services.[9]
Grupo Galicia Class B shares trade on the Córdoba Stock Exchange while Grupo Galicia ADSs trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, both under the ticker symbol "GGAL." Grupo Galicia comprises the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's blue-chip MERVAL Index and are included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International and Standard & Poor's indices, as well.[9]

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

Grupo Financiero Galicia is a financial services holding company based in Buenos Aires,[3] and its banking operations are the fifth largest in Argentina, as well as the largest among all domestically-owned private banks in the country.[4]
Overview[edit]
The bank was founded in 1905 as the Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires by a consortium led by Manuel Escasany, a jeweler and clock maker of Galician origin. The name referred to the Galician heritage of the Escasanys, the largest original shareholders,[5] as well as to the Spanish Argentine immigrant community from that region (who were second only to Italian Argentines in number).[6]




The original headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires.






New headquarters.


The bank maintained over 2,500 accounts by the end of its first year, and in 1907, it was listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange and garnered nearly 3,300 initial shareholders. The Buenos Aires branches were followed by one in neighboring Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1910, and in 1921, it began offering time deposits (which remain the most common form of savings among the Argentine public).[5]
Following the founder's death in 1948, his son, Eduardo Escasany, became its president and by 1960, he had secured a partnership with the Ayerzas and the Brauns, two influential local families prominent in the Argentine ranching and retail sectors, respectively. The Banco de Galicia became the largest, domestically-owned private bank in Argentina in 1965 and by 1975, ranked second to the public National Mortgage Bank in new home loans, and employed around 3,900 staff in 93 branches, nationwide. Banco de Galicia in 1993 became the first Latin American bank to enter both the U.S. and European stock markets, and the first to raise funds on the U.S. domestic capital market by floating a $200 million, ten-year Yankee bond. The following year it was the first to issue convertible bonds on the international securities market, enabling the bank to remain in Argentine hands at a time when many of its rivals were sold to Spanish banks. A branch was opened in New York in 1994, and the group acquired a one-eighth share in the newly privatized postal service. Banco Galicia established an insurance company, Sudamericana Holding S.A., in 1996 as a joint venture with The Hartford.[5]
The company's decision in 2000 to demolish its historic downtown Buenos Aires headquarters in favor of a modern, 34-story building met with controversy, though the new offices were later completed.[7][8] A family feud among the Escasany siblings led to the establishment in 2000 of the Banco de Galicia Foundation, which owns over 94% of the outstanding shares of Banco Galicia. Though a sell-off of public shares was averted, given the controversy, the Argentine economic crisis led to the loss of nearly half of the bank's deposits between 2001 and 2002, and to its near-insolvency, when its dollar-denominated debt of US$1.8 billion required borrowing on flexible terms from the Central Bank of Argentina; Escasany, who had also been chairman of the Argentine Banking Association, resigned as CEO in 2002. The bank recovered during 2003, however, when its losses of US$436 million were trimmed to US$73 million, and it has remained profitable in the ensuing years.[5]
The façade and engineering for the new building was provided by Obras Metálicas S. A.
The bank remains the largest private sector commercial bank in Argentina ranked by deposits, assets or loans. As of April 2009, the group maintained 236 branches and total deposits in Argentina amounted to nearly US$ 4.5 billion, a 6% market share, and 7.6% among private sector depositors.[4] Consolidated assets totaled US$ 7.7 billion and loans to the private sector, US$ 3.7 billion (6.5% of the market).[4][9]
Besides its holdings in Banco Galicia, GFG participates in other business sectors through four companies: Grupo Sudamericana, an insurance holding company specialized in life, retirement, and hemeowner's policies; Galicia Warrants S.A., a warehouse rental services and issuer of certificate of deposits company; Net Investment, a holding company oriented to invest in Internet projects that can have synergies with Banco Galicia; and Galval Agente de Valores S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of GFG, based in Uruguay and created with the purpose of providing custody services.[9]
Grupo Galicia Class B shares trade on the Córdoba Stock Exchange while Grupo Galicia ADSs trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, both under the ticker symbol "GGAL." Grupo Galicia comprises the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's blue-chip MERVAL Index and are included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International and Standard & Poor's indices, as well.[9]

Grupo Financiero Galicia is a financial services holding company based in Buenos Aires,[3] and its banking operations are the fifth largest in Argentina, as well as the largest among all domestically-owned private banks in the country.[4]
Overview[edit]
The bank was founded in 1905 as the Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires by a consortium led by Manuel Escasany, a jeweler and clock maker of Galician origin. The name referred to the Galician heritage of the Escasanys, the largest original shareholders,[5] as well as to the Spanish Argentine immigrant community from that region (who were second only to Italian Argentines in number).[6]

The bank maintained over 2,500 accounts by the end of its first year, and in 1907, it was listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange and garnered nearly 3,300 initial shareholders. The Buenos Aires branches were followed by one in neighboring Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1910, and in 1921, it began offering time deposits (which remain the most common form of savings among the Argentine public).[5]
Following the founder's death in 1948, his son, Eduardo Escasany, became its president and by 1960, he had secured a partnership with the Ayerzas and the Brauns, two influential local families prominent in the Argentine ranching and retail sectors, respectively. The Banco de Galicia became the largest, domestically-owned private bank in Argentina in 1965 and by 1975, ranked second to the public National Mortgage Bank in new home loans, and employed around 3,900 staff in 93 branches, nationwide. Banco de Galicia in 1993 became the first Latin American bank to enter both the U.S. and European stock markets, and the first to raise funds on the U.S. domestic capital market by floating a $200 million, ten-year Yankee bond. The following year it was the first to issue convertible bonds on the international securities market, enabling the bank to remain in Argentine hands at a time when many of its rivals were sold to Spanish banks. A branch was opened in New York in 1994, and the group acquired a one-eighth share in the newly privatized postal service. Banco Galicia established an insurance company, Sudamericana Holding S.A., in 1996 as a joint venture with The Hartford.[5]
The company's decision in 2000 to demolish its historic downtown Buenos Aires headquarters in favor of a modern, 34-story building met with controversy, though the new offices were later completed.[7][8] A family feud among the Escasany siblings led to the establishment in 2000 of the Banco de Galicia Foundation, which owns over 94% of the outstanding shares of Banco Galicia. Though a sell-off of public shares was averted, given the controversy, the Argentine economic crisis led to the loss of nearly half of the bank's deposits between 2001 and 2002, and to its near-insolvency, when its dollar-denominated debt of US$1.8 billion required borrowing on flexible terms from the Central Bank of Argentina; Escasany, who had also been chairman of the Argentine Banking Association, resigned as CEO in 2002. The bank recovered during 2003, however, when its losses of US$436 million were trimmed to US$73 million, and it has remained profitable in the ensuing years.[5]
The façade and engineering for the new building was provided by Obras Metálicas S. A.
The bank remains the largest private sector commercial bank in Argentina ranked by deposits, assets or loans. As of April 2009, the group maintained 236 branches and total deposits in Argentina amounted to nearly US$ 4.5 billion, a 6% market share, and 7.6% among private sector depositors.[4] Consolidated assets totaled US$ 7.7 billion and loans to the private sector, US$ 3.7 billion (6.5% of the market).[4][9]
Besides its holdings in Banco Galicia, GFG participates in other business sectors through four companies: Grupo Sudamericana, an insurance holding company specialized in life, retirement, and hemeowner's policies; Galicia Warrants S.A., a warehouse rental services and issuer of certificate of deposits company; Net Investment, a holding company oriented to invest in Internet projects that can have synergies with Banco Galicia; and Galval Agente de Valores S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of GFG, based in Uruguay and created with the purpose of providing custody services.[9]
Grupo Galicia Class B shares trade on the Córdoba Stock Exchange while Grupo Galicia ADSs trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, both under the ticker symbol "GGAL." Grupo Galicia comprises the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's blue-chip MERVAL Index and are included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International and Standard & Poor's indices, as well.[9]
