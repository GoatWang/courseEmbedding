 Riding the Wireless Wave to the Stars
How David Grain's private equity firm ventures into spaces others don't dare

In 2006, Crown Castle International purchased Global Signal, a cell tower company in Sarasota, Florida, for $5.7 billion. CCI is the nation’s largest provider of wireless infrastructure. As a result of the sale, investors made more than 12 times their original investment, with the Global Signal team making $100 million. Former president of Global Signal, David J. Grain, led the charge during the company’s incredible four-year turnaround.
Although this was a monumental achievement, for Grain it was only the beginning. In 2007, he built Grain Management L.L.C. with $5 million of his own money, venture capital from General Catalyst Partners, and Sutter Hill Ventures. Over the next three years, Grain Management went on to acquire 50 cell towers.
Now, Grain Management  (No. 7 on the BE Private Equity list with $900 million in capital under management) has grown into a powerhouse, with two funds: Grain Infrastructure I and II. The company acquires, builds, and owns wireless infrastructure assets across North America. It also holds wireless spectrum licenses and issues spectrum-backed securities. That’s why we’ve named it the 2015 black enterprise Financial Services Company of the Year.
Building Grain Management
Raising the $109 million he needed to build his business and accumulate funds took Grain almost two years—a task made no easier by the 2009 financial crisis on Wall Street. Grain, undeterred, decided to take his money-raising efforts down a nontraditional path: the academic investment community. He met with more than 180 people, including heads of foundations, colleges, and university endowments.
“The approach they take is a reasonably intellectual one. If you’re fortunate enough to attract their capital, it’s a great endorsement that, OK, you’ve passed the test and have some level of credibility,” says Grain.
Former Duke University investment manager Ed Hutchinson worked with DUMAC—a professionally staffed investment organization run by Duke—when the decision to invest in Grain Management was made. Hutchinson was as impressed with Grain as Grain was with the academic community.
“The reason we elected to back him is he’s just one of those people that, for lack of a better description, had ‘it.’ You just knew he was going to be successful and [that he] was someone you, whole-heartedly, could trust to do the right things. This was clearly demonstrated throughout his career,” says Hutchinson.

Grain will bring his financial and leadership skills to the Black Enterprise Entrepreneurs Summit when it hits the Hyatt Regency Atlanta May 13-15.Grain’s knowledge comes from a multitude of success. His private equity firm, Grain Management L.L.C., invests in the wireless communications sector, and Grain Infrastructure Funds I and II manage capital from investors including foundations and public pension funds. Before his current venture, he was founder and CEO of Grain Communications Group Inc., focusing on acquiring, building and owning wireless communications tower sites for the federal and state government systems. Politically active, President Barack Obama appointed Grain to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) in July 2011 where he chaired the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience National R&D Plan.Black Enterprise: Many talk about visualizing success and where one wants to be. When you began your career, did you see yourself being where you are today? David Grain: I did not imagine myself here. I’ve always been a bit of a dreamer, and I’ve always spent a lot of time being fascinated with successful people of all walks of life. I also always read biographies. I think over time, my fascination with the lives of successful people morphed into me in a positive way. That’s helped me refine my focus overtime and direct my energy.Who were the influences that helped you? I’d say my grandmother. She was a domestic in Coney Island working for a family. And the only person left was the old man she worked for. He owned a couple brownstones around Brooklyn. When he died, she managed to get control of these brownstones. By the time I was of age, she was in her ’70s, and I would follow behind her collecting money, driving around Brooklyn. It was really fascinating. This was a woman who did not waste a penny. We had 8 or 10 of these properties, and I [recall that] when people didn’t pay the rent, she’d have to evict them. If it was a single mother or children, she might be lenient and maybe throw them a few dollars to help them out. She was a rental entrepreneur.What’s been the key to business success for you?I think I would point out a handful of principles that would come from my grandmother. Get in there, stay late, grind it out, and nothing is easy. If you have good intentions and you work hard, you’ve got a good shot of being successful. I have lived by this principle, of having high integrity, and not looking at short cuts—working hard. Now, I recognize there are no coincidences, and regardless of how hard I work, if it’s isn’t for the good Lord, none of this is possible.What’s the most important thing an entrepreneur should remember?I’ve heard this my entire career and only now do I genuinely understand, believe, and trust it: If you’re not enjoying what you’re doing, if you don’t love hopping out of bed in the morning and going after whatever it is you’re going after—if it is work—it’s really difficult in a sustainable way to achieve success doing whatever that thing is. So somehow you’ve got to figure it out. And this is what goes through my mind in the morning: how excited I am about what I have to do today. And if I’m not, how tomorrow I’m going to adjust it so I’m excited about what I’m doing. If you don’t love what you’re doing, you better figure out how to change it to something you love.The Black Enterprise Entrepreneurs Summit hosted by Nationwide is set for May 13-16, 2015 at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.

David J. Grain will bring his financial and leadership skills to the Black Enterprise Entrepreneurs Summit when it hits the Hyatt Regency Atlanta May 13-15.
Grain’s knowledge comes from a multitude of success. His private equity firm, Grain Management L.L.C., invests in the wireless communications sector, and Grain Infrastructure Funds I and II manage capital from investors including foundations and public pension funds. Before his current venture, he was founder and CEO of Grain Communications Group Inc., focusing on acquiring, building and owning wireless communications tower sites for the federal and state government systems. Politically active, President Barack Obama appointed Grain to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) in July 2011 where he chaired the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience National R&D Plan.
Black Enterprise: Many talk about visualizing success and where one wants to be. When you began your career, did you see yourself being where you are today? 
David Grain: I did not imagine myself here. I’ve always been a bit of a dreamer, and I’ve always spent a lot of time being fascinated with successful people of all walks of life. I also always read biographies. I think over time, my fascination with the lives of successful people morphed into me in a positive way. That’s helped me refine my focus overtime and direct my energy.
Who were the influences that helped you? 
I’d say my grandmother. She was a domestic in Coney Island working for a family. And the only person left was the old man she worked for. He owned a couple brownstones around Brooklyn. When he died, she managed to get control of these brownstones. By the time I was of age, she was in her ’70s, and I would follow behind her collecting money, driving around Brooklyn. It was really fascinating. This was a woman who did not waste a penny. We had 8 or 10 of these properties, and I [recall that] when people didn’t pay the rent, she’d have to evict them. If it was a single mother or children, she might be lenient and maybe throw them a few dollars to help them out. She was a rental entrepreneur.
What’s been the key to business success for you?
I think I would point out a handful of principles that would come from my grandmother. Get in there, stay late, grind it out, and nothing is easy. If you have good intentions and you work hard, you’ve got a good shot of being successful. I have lived by this principle, of having high integrity, and not looking at short cuts—working hard. Now, I recognize there are no coincidences, and regardless of how hard I work, if it’s isn’t for the good Lord, none of this is possible.
What’s the most important thing an entrepreneur should remember?
I’ve heard this my entire career and only now do I genuinely understand, believe, and trust it: If you’re not enjoying what you’re doing, if you don’t love hopping out of bed in the morning and going after whatever it is you’re going after—if it is work—it’s really difficult in a sustainable way to achieve success doing whatever that thing is. So somehow you’ve got to figure it out. And this is what goes through my mind in the morning: how excited I am about what I have to do today. And if I’m not, how tomorrow I’m going to adjust it so I’m excited about what I’m doing. If you don’t love what you’re doing, you better figure out how to change it to something you love.

David J. Grain will bring his financial and leadership skills to the Black Enterprise Entrepreneurs Summit when it hits the Hyatt Regency Atlanta May 13-15.
Grain’s knowledge comes from a multitude of success. His private equity firm, Grain Management L.L.C., invests in the wireless communications sector, and Grain Infrastructure Funds I and II manage capital from investors including foundations and public pension funds. Before his current venture, he was founder and CEO of Grain Communications Group Inc., focusing on acquiring, building and owning wireless communications tower sites for the federal and state government systems. Politically active, President Barack Obama appointed Grain to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) in July 2011 where he chaired the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience National R&D Plan.
Black Enterprise: Many talk about visualizing success and where one wants to be. When you began your career, did you see yourself being where you are today?
