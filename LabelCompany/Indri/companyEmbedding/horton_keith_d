Penn Virginia Corp.


                  PVA is an independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas in various domestic onshore regions including Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Pennsylvania.

Having completed our transformation to a “pure play” E&P company, we are now focusing our efforts on oil and NGL (natural gas liquids) investment opportunities rather than natural gas. During 2012, we grew our oil and NGL production to 48% (56% for the 4th quarter of 2012) of our total production, an increase compared to 28% during 2011.  These investments have yielded higher cash flows and margins that more than offset the decline in production volumes and realized prices from our natural gas production assets.  We expect our oil and NGL production to continue to grow as a percentage of our total production as we pursue higher rate-of-return projects in economically attractive oil and NGL-rich areas
