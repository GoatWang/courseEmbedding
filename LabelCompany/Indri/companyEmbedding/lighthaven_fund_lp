Commitment to Action 



Eco Products Fund, L.P.



Commitment by


    Equator Environmental, LLC  





In 2007, Equator and New Forest committed to establish the Eco Products Fund, a $100 million fund for investment in carbon, wetlands, and biodiversity mitigation. The fund is primarily focused on opportunities within United States, but also intends to devote a portion of the capital to international endeavors. The Eco Products Fund has committed over $20 million to forest carbon and wetlands mitigation projects. The fund is aimed at realizing value from illiquid environmental assets such as carbon, water, and biodiversity, and to use innovative financial structures to represent the value of these critical services in the marketplace.

    Partner(s) of the Commitment Maker(s)  

    Fundecor,   

    New Forests, Inc.  

Details

I. Equator Environmental will create a $100 million private equity fund to make investments in wetlands mitigation, endangered species conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality, and other ecosystem-based projects, and to monetize the value of such projects.  All investments will be based on land, forest or vegetation-based projects in North America.
Ecosystems provide many of the services upon which the global economy depends, such as water purification, biodiversity conservation and atmospheric climate regulation.  Globally, approximately 60% of 'ecosystem services' provided by nature are being used unsustainably or are in decline. Over the past twenty years, the amount of developed land has grown by 50% in the United States through increasing population and urbanization, creating pollution, water quality and other environmental problems.  The weight of the economy on the natural infrastructure of the U.S. has led to the pricing of ecosystems services.  Equator Environmental believes that by establishing a fund to invest in projects that preserve and enhance the viability of our ecosystems, we can have a direct impact on the preservation of our ecological assets. Equator also believes that by monetizing such assets through the creation of environmental credits and other 'eco products', we will be able to enhance the market value of our ecosystems, and create further incentives for environmental conservation.
II CGI's tremendous leadership over the past two years on environmental issues has helped inspire Equator Environmental to launch this fund, which is the first of its kind.
Measures of Success: Measures of success may include the growth of nascent markets (carbon, biodiversity, endangered species and water), creation of new financial platforms and instruments for these markets, and a rise in public awareness.
TIMELINE:
Anticipated Launch: December, 2007
First Milestone(s): Invest in at least one of each: terrestrial carbon sequestration project, wetlands mitigation project, endangered species project.
06/30/08:
Participants in this Activity: Members of Equator Environmental, LLC and New Forests Inc.


    Background  

The Eco-Products Fund will be jointly managed by Equator Environmental LLC and New Forests Inc.  Equator and New Forests bring together critical areas of expertise in underlying scientific and technical disciplines and in financial structuring, trading and commercialization of assets. In addition, the partnership creates a one stop shop with strengths in sourcing/origination, transaction management, and distribution.


    Partnership Opportunities  

SEEKING:  implementing partners, best practices information.
OFFERING:  financial resources, implementing partners, best practices information, media and marketing assistance.


Progress Reports

July 2008
The current flagship program of the commitment is the Duck's Unlimited Avoided Grassland Conversion Project in the Prairie Pothole Region.  The goal of the DU Avoided Grassland Conversion project is to protect the Prairie Pothole Region (of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana) by placing perpetual conservation easements to avoid conversion to cropping. The Project aims to protect 30,000 acres by the end of 2009.
Milestones Reached:
- Currently, over 10,000 acres have been placed under easement or are pending acceptance by the National Fish and Wildlife Service.
- To date, the National Fish and Wildlife Service has never rejected any of Equator Environmental's proposed easements.
