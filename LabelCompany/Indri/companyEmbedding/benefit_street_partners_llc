		Overview & Strategy


Overview & Strategy

Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC (“GB-BDC”) is a non-traded business development company (“BDC”) that primarily invests in senior debt securities issued by U.S. middle market companies. GB-BDC’s lending strategy is focused on creditworthy, well managed companies with predictable cash flows, many of whom are in the media and communications industries where Benefit Street Partners and their parent company Providence Equity Partners, have longstanding relationships and industry expertise. With a single investment in GB-BDC, individual investors gain access to institutional-quality, credit-oriented investments and have the opportunity for both current income and capital appreciation, with a measure of protection against inflation in a rising interest rate environment.

Current Annualized Distribution Rate (1):
7.65%The Board of Directors has declared a daily distribution rate which is equivalent to an annualized distribution rate of 7.65% assuming a $9.80 purchase price, or 7.5% assuming a $10.00 purchase price. Future distribution declarations are at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and are not guaranteed.



 Distribution Frequency (1):
Declared monthly, paid monthly



 Tax Reporting:

investment strategy
GB-BDC intends to primarily invest:  

in secured debt and unsecured debt as well as equity and equity related securities issued by private U.S. companies primarily in the middle market, as well as public U.S. companies with market equity capitalization of less than $250 million,
with a strong focus on credit quality, including a high level of investment discipline and selectivity,
originating its debt investments by leveraging Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.’s and Providence Equity Partners L.L.C.’s nationwide networks of relationships, including those in the media and communications industries, and
in transactions where GB-BDC is able to participate in return enhancement features such as original issue discount (OID), payment in kind (PIK), call protection and warrants designed to enhance returns above the coupon of the loans.

investment objective
GB-BDC is designed to primarily provide:

current income,
portfolio diversification,
and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation.

We believe our product will offer investors:

low correlation to the U.S. stock market and
a measure of protection against inflation and rising interest rates.

There can be no assurance that the GB-BDC will be able to implement its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives.

TICC Capital Corp has agreed to sell its investment adviser TICC Management LLC to Benefit Street Partners LLC, the credit investment arm of Providence Equity Partners. No financial terms were disclosed. UBS Investment Bank provided financial advice to TICC Management on the transaction while Houlihan Lokey did likewise for BSP.
PRESS RELEASE
GREENWICH, CT–(Marketwired – Aug 4, 2015) – TICC Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: TICC) (the “Company,” “TICC,” “we,” or “our”) announced today that the members of our investment adviser, TICC Management, LLC, have entered into an agreement with Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. (“BSP”), pursuant to which an affiliate of BSP will acquire TICC Management, LLC (the “Transaction”). BSP intends to expand TICC’s investment strategy to primarily focus on private debt investments. BSP is the credit investment arm of Providence Equity Partners, a leading global private equity firm. BSP and affiliates manage over $10 billion in assets across a broad range of credit strategies including high yield, levered loans, private / opportunistic debt, liquid credit, structured credit and commercial real estate debt.
“We believe that the BSP relationship will allow the Company to realize value for our shareholders in new ways. With access to significant bilateral lending opportunities and with the resources of a much larger lending and investing platform, we expect this transaction to place TICC in a position of strength as the credit markets move through this and future cycles,” said Jonathan Cohen, CEO of TICC Capital Corp. 





Thomas Gahan, Founder and CEO of BSP, said, “We are very excited about the opportunity to leverage our proprietary sourcing network, disciplined investment process and credit expertise to drive attractive, risk-adjusted returns in the portfolio and continue to serve the Company and its investors.”
The closing of the Transaction is contingent upon approval by the Company’s stockholders of a new investment advisory agreement between the Company and TICC Management, LLC, the election of four new independent directors, and other conditions that will be described in a related proxy statement. All material terms under the new investment advisory agreement will remain unchanged.
In connection with the Transaction, among other things:
BSP will replace the current members of the investment adviser’s investment committee and will be supported by BSP’s team of over 100 employees and nearly 60 investment and research professionals;
Over time, BSP plans to transition the Company’s portfolio from syndicated loans and collateralized loan obligation investment vehicles to primarily focus on private debt investments. BSP’s private debt strategy seeks to benefit from proprietary access to companies through an extensive, nationwide network of senior partner relationships, CEO relationships, key financial intermediaries, financial sponsors and the broader Providence Equity Platform;
The Company’s current Board of Directors will expand with the addition of four new non-interested directors, subject to shareholder approval, who will join the three existing non-interested directors. The two current interested directors will be replaced by Mr. Gahan and Richard Byrne, President of BSP; 





The Company’s current executive officers will be replaced with certain individuals that are affiliated with BSP; and
The Company will change its name.
The Company’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved a new investment advisory agreement between the Company and TICC Management, LLC and the other proposals that will be described in a related proxy statement. Completion of the Transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The Company intends to file a preliminary proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to solicit stockholder approval of the new investment advisory agreement and the election of four new independent directors.
UBS Investment Bank served as financial adviser to TICC Management, LLC and Houlihan Lokey served as financial adviser to BSP. K&L Gates LLP acted as legal counsel to TICC Management, LLC and Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP acted as legal counsel to BSP in connection with the Transaction.
About TICC Capital Corp.

About Benefit Street Partners

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
