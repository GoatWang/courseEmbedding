MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA--(Marketwired - Jul 21, 2017) -  Genetic Technologies Limited (ASX: GTG) (NASDAQ: GENE) ("Company"), today announced that on 20 July 2017, it received a notification letter (the "Notice") from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, notifying the Company that its closing bid price has been below the minimum $US1.00 per share requirement for a period of 30 consecutive business days and that the Company has not met the minimum bid price requirement of $US1.00 per share for continued inclusion under Nasdaq Marketplace Listing Rules (the "Rules").
The Notice stated that in accordance with the Rules the Company has 180 calendar days, or until 15 January 2018, to regain compliance. To regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, the Company's securities must meet or exceed the $US1.00 per share price for 10 consecutive business days. 
This deficiency notice does not immediately affect the Company's Nasdaq listing.
If the Company does not regain compliance with the Rules by 15 January 2018, Nasdaq will determine whether the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement. If it meets the initial listing criteria and upon written notice of the Company of its intention to cure the deficiency, Nasdaq will notify the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days compliance period. If the Company is not eligible for an additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide written confirmation that the Company's securities will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.
The relevant Listing Rules are:
5550(a)(2) - bid price
            
5810(c)(3)(A) - compliance period
            
5810(b) - public disclosure
            
5505 - Capital Market criteria
These Rules only apply to the Company's securities trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market and not the Company's ordinary shares trading on the Australian Securities Exchange, the Company's home exchange.

Awards Grants Honors

Heyd Wins EMET Prize




By Justin W.. 

 July 21, 2017 at 2:27 am
0


 





David Heyd, professor of philosophy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is the winner of the 2017 EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture in the Humanities category.
The EMET Prizes, which are sponsored by the A.M.N. Foundation for the Advancement of Science, Art and Culture in Israel in cooperation with the Prime Minister of Israel, are awarded annually “for excellence in academic and professional achievements that have far reaching influence and significant contribution to society” in five categories—the Exact Sciences, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities and  Judaism, and Art and Culture. The winners, who must be Israeli citizens or permanent residents, share a prize of $1 million.
The Jerusalem Post, reporting on the award, notes that Professor Heyd is only the second philosopher to have won an EMET Prize:
Heyd is a nationally recognized scholar whose philosophical thoughts have had influence on national medical and legal-medical issues. He has taken an active part in public debates about—and the formation of laws and regulations on—a wide array of bioethical issues. He served as a member of government committees on surrogacy, euthanasia, organ donation and genetic technologies, and was a member of the National Council for Bioethics, Hadassah’s Helsinki committee, the ethics committee of the Israel Association of Fertility and head of the Ethics in Research Committee of the Hebrew University.
Heyd said the hardest question he ever had to answer was whether a child can sue his parents (or any third party) for having been given a wrongful life.
“Let’s say you plan to have a child and you find out that child is going to be born with a problem,” Heyd explained.
“But you are told if you abort that child and wait two years, the next child will be all right. You have the sick child. Can the child say you wronged him by bringing him into the word? What are our duties to future, nonexistent people?” Heyd’s conclusion, which has legal implications: People cannot regret having been born or cannot say not being born in the first place would have been better for them. This is now how the court of Israel rules.
Heyd is careful to admit he does not think philosophers should take the place of scientists and doctors when it comes to making medical decisions.
“I am an expert in moral philosophy, but not morality,” Heyd said.
However, he said having a philosopher at the table for medical ethics discussions provides a set of analytical tools that likely could not be put forth by people less trained in philosophy. Philosophers can map problems and examine possible implications of solutions without being involved in the matter at hand.

McGrath 1 CommentJournal of Science Fiction and PhilosophyCall for Papers General ThemeThe Journal of Science Fiction and Philosophy, a peer-reviewed, open access publication, is dedicated to the analysis of philosophical themes present in science fiction stories in all formats, with a view to their use in the discussion, teaching, and narrative modeling of philosophical ideas. It aims at highlighting the role of science fiction as a medium for philosophical reflection.The Journal is currently accepting papers and paper proposals. Because this is the Journal’s first issue, papers specifically reflecting on the relationship between philosophy and science fiction are especially encouraged, but all areas of philosophy are welcome. Any format of SF story (short story, novel, movie, TV series, interactive) may be addressed.We welcome papers written with teaching in mind! Have used an SF story to teach a particular item in your curricula (e.g., using the movie Gattaca to introduce the ethics of genetic technologies, or The Island of Dr. Moreau to discuss personhood)? Turn that class into a paper! Yearly ThemeEvery year the Journal selects a Yearly Theme. Papers addressing the Yearly Theme are collected in a special section of the Journal. The Yearly Theme for 2017 is All Persons Great and Small: The Notion of Personhood in Science Fiction Stories.SF stories are in a unique position to help us examine the concept of personhood, by making the human  world engage with a bewildering variety of beings with person-like qualities – aliens of bizarre shapes and customs, artificial constructs conflicted about their artificiality, planetary-wide intelligences, collective minds, and the list goes on. Every one of these instances provides the opportunity to reflect on specific aspects of the notion of personhood, such as, for example: What is a person? What are its defining qualities? What is the connection between personhood and morality, identity, rationality, basic (“human?”) rights? What patterns do SF authors identify when describing the oppression of one group of persons by another, and how do they reflect past and present human history?The Journal accepts papers year-round. The deadline for the first round of reviews, both for its general and yearly theme, is October 1st, 2017.Contact the Editor at editor.jsfphil@gmail.com with any questions, or visit www.jsfphil.org for more information.   Filed Under: Call for Papers, science fiction Tagged With: call for papers, personhood, science fiction 1 CommentStay in touch!

McGrath:ReLACSing #CFPNot In The Spaces We KnowPrivatizing Healthcare is like Privatizing Police ProtectionCall for Papers - AI and Apocalypse « Majestic Journey  Happy New Year, Mandaeans! »  John MacDonald I think an interesting paper might be how the Greek notion of δεινόν-deinon (uncanny / unhomely) is to be understood in distinction to the concept of παρἐστιοσ-parestios (one in the warmth of the hearth fire). This could be explored by relating themes of the passengers of Voyager in Star Trek trying to return home and Odysseus pining for home on the Island Of Calypso, the “δεινὴ θεός- deinē theos).”  Exploring the relationship between parestios and deinon in this way would also provide an interesting opportunity to attempt a translation of Sophocles’ fundamental interpretation of humans in the Antigone when he writes “Polla ta deina kouden anthropou deinoteron pelei,” which is usually translated as “Many are the wonders and terrors but none more wondrous than man.” GET	PATHEOS NEWSLETTERS Sign up for free newsletters and special offers       Get the	Best of Patheos Newsletter    Get the	Progressive Christian Newsletter    Get the	Religion Prof: The Blog of James F.

Genetic Data for 1000 Microbes Released









Microbial organisms are a major component of our environment, but scientists have only begun to study their genetic composition in depth. Using current genetic technologies, researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI) have begun to learn more, and have released their findings. The team has reported 1,003 phylogenetically reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal organisms in Nature Biotechnology.

Genome sequencing and analysis data for 1,003 genomes is now available through the Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiomes (IMG/M) system. The DOE JGI is aiming to provide interested scientists with a trove of new sequence data. It could aid in the characterization of biotechnologically relevant secondary metabolites or reveal more about enzymes that act under certain conditions.



According to the Nature paper:

"We present 1,003 reference genomes that were sequenced as part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) initiative, selected to maximize sequence coverage of phylogenetic space. These genomes double the number of existing type strains and expand their overall phylogenetic diversity by 25%. Comparative analyses with previously available finished and draft genomes reveal a 10.5% increase in novel protein families as a function of phylogenetic diversity. The GEBA genomes recruit 25 million previously unassigned metagenomic proteins from 4,650 samples, improving their phylogenetic and functional interpretation. We identify numerous biosynthetic clusters and experimentally validate a divergent phenazine cluster with potential new chemical structure and antimicrobial activity. This Resource is the largest single release of reference genomes to date. Bacterial and archaeal isolate sequence space is still far from saturated, and future endeavors in this direction will continue to be a valuable resource for scientific discovery."

Introduction
Founded in 1989, Genetic Technologies Limited is an established Australian-based molecular diagnostics company specialising in women’s health. The Company offers predictive testing and assessment tools to help physicians proactively manage women’s health. The Company’s lead product, BREVAGenplus®, is a clinically validated risk assessment test for non-hereditary breast cancer and is first in its class.
The Company markets BREVAGenplus to healthcare professionals in comprehensive breast health care and imaging centres, as well as to obstetricians/gynaecologists (OBGYNs) and breast cancer risk assessment specialists (such as breast surgeons).


BREVAGenplus
Released in October 2014, BREVAGenplus® improves upon the predictive power of the first generation BREVAGen™ test and is designed to facilitate better informed decisions about breast cancer screening and preventive treatment plans. BREVAGenplus expands the application of BREVAGen from Caucasian women to include African-Americans and Hispanics, and is directed towards women aged 35 years or above, who have not had breast cancer and have one or more risk factors for developing breast cancer.


Genetic Technologies
Listed on the ASX (GTG) in 2000 and Nasdaq (GENE) in 2005, Genetic Technologies Limited has established a successful fee-for-service genetic testing business that is primarily focused on the U.S. market. The Company successfully launched the first generation BREVAGen™ test across the U.S. in 2011, via its U.S. subsidiary Phenogen Sciences Inc., and released the second generation BREVAGenplus® test, in October 2014, significantly expanding the applicable market.

History - as told by company founder Philip Yates
Genetic Technologies Limited established 1986 by Philip Yates
 
After leaving Yates I came to the conclusion at age 53 that the only realistic outcome was to start my own business. A new seed company seemed the natural follow on, and in 1986 Genetic Technologies Limited was formed with the specific purpose of building the Pioneer seed brand in this country.
After the Equiticorp debacle I was offered the Pioneer representation. When the importing of hybrid maize seed proved non commercially viable (a result of sub standard quality and supply issues), the decision was made to build a specialist maize seed production plant in Gisborne.
Genetic Technologies Limited today remains a Yates family business. My only son William Yates (born 1965) now leads the management team. William holds to all the traditional family business values which have been preserved over the last 223 years in the seed business.
