@gohan6425 It's a shame that she didn't get a good turn out. Must have been a bad experience for her to not want to come back.
The anime convention here tends to have 1 time each day for each guest to do autographs, so there is usually a line. Some guests (like for cosplay) tend to be at their booth for more of the day. The big Comic Expo seems to have guests at their booth unless they are doing a panel, so they are usually there a few times during the day. Some guests don't seem to have many people in line at times, but that seems to be more when they have been at the booth for a while and the first rush has gone through.

@Spaceshotx7 said in Are the fan service shows currently being dub censored?:

Why are the Japanese less strict when it comes to portraying underage girls in sexual situations, while the English speaking countries consider it child pornography and censor it?

I'm all for standing up for the rights to express thoughts and opinions on open forum, but a couple of things need addressed here.  First, AND FOREMOST child pornography is never an acceptable topic to be agreeing with.
As to Japans censors, even the TV version of this show had this scene removed.  Japan is often portrayed as being sexually open, and in some cases that is slightly true.  They do not have the religious stigma generally associated in western cultures.  However, they do still have morals regarding their behavior and, no different than in western society, those morals still play a big part in their behaviors.  Believe it or not, even though I watched it in Japan, when watching Seven Mortal Sins, I still had to deal with the huge red and black floating magic circles even though it was on late night TV.  Japanese TV only has one word which is censored, and there is never a reason to use it so it's a moot point.  This isn't because Japan is loose in their morals.  It's actually the opposite.  Their language doesn't really have any words which would be derogatory enough to substantiate a need.
Back to the point at hand, there is a reason so many lolita characters ages are highlighted in anime.  In nearly all cases where it's made fun of, it's not the contrast of their look and age.  Asia as a whole tends to have women which look much younger than they really are.  The point is to highlight that their romantic interests aren't breaking any kind of taboo.  Haganai is a high school anime, so it should be automatically implied that the scene mentioned can't be defended by saying the loli is 900 years old.

Well I'm glad to know that you're pleased by the quality of the software. At least it's not recording the playback but I understand how you feel about it keeping a note on everything you watch in fullscreen. Seeing that you are part of the community, I'm pretty sure it would be easy for you to get help on how to disable the feature without needing to go those annoying ad-filled "computer tricks" websites you can find on Google.
