                    FILE - In this June 7, 2015, file photo, Miami Marlins catcher J.T. Realmuto throws to first base to put out Colorado Rockies first baseman Wilin Rosario in the ninth inning of a baseball game, in Denver. The stolen base has been stolen from much of baseball, an afterthought when spring training starts next week. Sabermetrics have played a huge role in the steal's decline. When a hitter steps into a batter's box and a runner takes a lead, managers and coaches know the pitcher's delivery time to home plate and the catcher's pop time _ the second-plus lag between the ball hitting the mitt and it touching the middle infielder's glove. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)                                    


MIDWEST CITY — The first pitch was impressive enough. A high-90s fastball followed by that electric smile.
The glove popped with a special sound each pitch. It didn't matter the 6-foot-3 right-hander on the mound was roughly 40 pounds overweight.
J.T. Realmuto was amazed.
There stood Jose Fernandez, a teenager at the time full of energy.
“He was just a chubby ol' (19)-year-old kid, but he was throwing gas,” Realmuto said. “He always had that nasty slider. He was by far probably the best pitcher I ever caught stuff-wise.”
Five months after Fernandez's tragic death in a boating accident and just weeks after Royals star Yordano Ventura died in a car accident in the Dominican Republic, baseball returns to work this week.
But there will be heavy hearts.
“It'll definitely be tough the first week or so,” Realmuto told The Oklahoman before it was revealed the Marlins would wear a patch this season to honor Fernandez.
For Realmuto and Fernandez, there was a special bond. The two were considered bright prospects when they met. They quickly became friends, too.
Realmuto was drafted from Carl Albert High School in the third round of the 2010 draft. Then a shortstop who decimated Oklahoma pitching, he was immediately converted to catcher.
With little to no experience behind the plate, he had to learn to call and manage games. He had to learn his pitchers, who in the lower levels make learning to catch challenging with impressive velocity and breaking balls but little to no control.
In 2012 he met Fernandez.
“He was awesome. Just happy as can be; always in a good mood — apart from him being a dominating pitcher,” Realmuto said. “He was just the friendliest kid you'll ever meet. You always knew he was there. He was just one of those guys that you never missed.”
They worked a lot together in Class A. The following spring training they worked even more together with both ticketed to open in Double A.
Fernandez never pitched in the minors that season. He jumped to Miami and ultimately was named Rookie of the Year. Realmuto followed a year later and Fernandez was the lone pitcher on staff Realmuto knew.
And as Realmuto grew behind the plate, he developed an ability to help keep Fernandez out of trouble on the field.
Fernandez's smile and laugh upset opponents following a strikeout. He playfully threw gum at umpires or sunflower seeds at fans. He was loud in the clubhouse.
“He never took anything too serious,” Realmuto said. “It wasn't him trying to show anybody up. It was him legitimately just always having a good time.”
But pitching Fernandez did take seriously. Realmuto noticed something special in the dugout when Fernandez's day was finished.
It's how he wants to remember his friend.
“After a good game you could tell he was just the happiest person on the planet,” Realmuto said.

Carl Bert Albert (May 10, 1908 – February 4, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 46th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977, representing Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat from 1947 to 1977.
Albert represented a southeastern Oklahoma Congressional district as a Democrat for 30 years, starting in 1947. He is best known for his service as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977. At 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 metres) tall, Albert was often affectionately known as the "Little Giant from Little Dixie", and held the highest political office of any Oklahoman in American history.

Early years, education[edit]
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth his family moved to a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He was the son of a coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame.[1] Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Greek letter fraternity, and a member of the all-male spirit club. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter's College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work, until the start of World War II.
War years[edit]
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served with the Third Armored Division briefly, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant. Most of his service was with the Judge Advocate General Corps. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific.[2] The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David.[3] For his service, Albert earned a Bronze Star, and saw service in the Pacific Theater, where he served in the office of the judge advocate general on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946.[4]
Enters Congress[edit]
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S Truman's containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker's office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and was elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn's death in 1961.[2]
However, Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he "... very much disliked doctrinaire liberals – they want to own your minds. And I don’t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone's inborn political philosophy."[5]
Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.[6]
Majority Congressional Leader[edit]




Majority Leader Albert with President Lyndon B. Johnson


As Majority Leader, Albert was a key figure in advancing the Democratic legislative agenda in the House, particularly with health care legislation. Medicare, the federal program of hospital insurance for persons 65 and older, was initially proposed by the Kennedy Administration as an amendment to the Social Security program. Albert knew the bill had insufficient Congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten key Republicans and eight key southern Democrats. He advised President Kennedy to seek Senate passage of the measure first. Albert calculated that the Senate should bring it to the House as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill, instead of trying direct introduction into the House.
Although well-planned, Albert's efforts on behalf of the Medicare bill were not successful at that time. After the Kennedy assassination, Albert worked to change House rules so that the majority Democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of Congress under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The changes included more majority leverage over the House Rules Committee, and stronger majority membership influence in the House Ways and Means Committee. With these changes in place, Albert was able to push through the Medicare bill, known as the Social Security Act of 1965, and he shepherded other pieces of Johnson's Great Society program through Congress.
Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the convention venue, and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War, and Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race for his party's presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating New Hampshire primary.
Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon's first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert's Chief of Staff was Charles Ward, a respected Washington DC leader and former newspaper editor from Oklahoma.
As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as Speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study.[7] Also in 1973 Albert appointed Felda Looper as the first female page in the House of Representatives.[8]
Watergate crisis[edit]
In 1973, during Albert's second term as Speaker and Nixon's second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was Governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as Vice President and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties, should that office become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President in October 1973. As the Watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was impeached from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.
This was the first occasion since the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As Speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any Vice Presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself Acting President. However, Albert concluded that, as a Democrat, he had no right to inherit a Presidency that had been won by a Republican ticket in 1972. He later stated that if he had become Acting President by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the House and Senate had confirmed a Republican Vice President. The Vice Presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President in December 1973.
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of Vice President was once more left vacant when Ford was sworn in as President that day. After former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as Vice President in December, any issue of presidential succession was moot.
A different issue arose during Albert's last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.[9][10][11][12]
Retirement[edit]




Official portrait as Speaker


After he left Washington, Albert returned to McAlester, turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns. He died there on February 4, 2000. Albert published his memoirs, with help from university professor Danney Goble, entitled Little Giant (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8061-2250-1). A post-retirement editorial in the New York Times said he was, "... a conciliator and seeker of consensus, a patient persuader . . . trusted for his fairness and integrity."[5]
After retiring from Congress, he went home to Bugtussle, although he maintained an office in McAlester. He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.[5]
Death and legacy[edit]
Albert died at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000.[4]
The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert's life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert's Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s. Carl Albert Indian Health Facility in Ada is part of the Public Health Service) and is administered by the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Durant named its Carl Albert Park for him, and a monument to Albert resides at his birthplace in McAlester. Several institutions and buildings in Oklahoma bear Albert's name. Carl B. Albert Middle School and Carl B. Albert High School in Midwest City and Carl Albert State College in Poteau are named for him.[5]
The University of Oxford established a monument to Albert in the Eunomia Chambers of the St Peter's College Law Library.
Personal life[edit]
Carl Albert married Mary Harmon in 1942; they had a son and a daughter.

Carl Bert Albert (May 10, 1908 – February 4, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 46th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977, representing Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat from 1947 to 1977.
Albert represented a southeastern Oklahoma Congressional district as a Democrat for 30 years, starting in 1947. He is best known for his service as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977. At 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 metres) tall, Albert was often affectionately known as the "Little Giant from Little Dixie", and held the highest political office of any Oklahoman in American history.

Early years, education[edit]
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth his family moved to a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He was the son of a coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame.[1] Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Greek letter fraternity, and a member of the all-male spirit club. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter's College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work, until the start of World War II.
War years[edit]
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served with the Third Armored Division briefly, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant. Most of his service was with the Judge Advocate General Corps. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific.[2] The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David.[3] For his service, Albert earned a Bronze Star, and saw service in the Pacific Theater, where he served in the office of the judge advocate general on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946.[4]
Enters Congress[edit]
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S Truman's containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker's office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and was elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn's death in 1961.[2]
However, Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he "... very much disliked doctrinaire liberals – they want to own your minds. And I don’t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone's inborn political philosophy."[5]
Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.[6]
Majority Congressional Leader[edit]




Majority Leader Albert with President Lyndon B. Johnson


As Majority Leader, Albert was a key figure in advancing the Democratic legislative agenda in the House, particularly with health care legislation. Medicare, the federal program of hospital insurance for persons 65 and older, was initially proposed by the Kennedy Administration as an amendment to the Social Security program. Albert knew the bill had insufficient Congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten key Republicans and eight key southern Democrats. He advised President Kennedy to seek Senate passage of the measure first. Albert calculated that the Senate should bring it to the House as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill, instead of trying direct introduction into the House.
Although well-planned, Albert's efforts on behalf of the Medicare bill were not successful at that time. After the Kennedy assassination, Albert worked to change House rules so that the majority Democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of Congress under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The changes included more majority leverage over the House Rules Committee, and stronger majority membership influence in the House Ways and Means Committee. With these changes in place, Albert was able to push through the Medicare bill, known as the Social Security Act of 1965, and he shepherded other pieces of Johnson's Great Society program through Congress.
Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the convention venue, and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War, and Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race for his party's presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating New Hampshire primary.
Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon's first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert's Chief of Staff was Charles Ward, a respected Washington DC leader and former newspaper editor from Oklahoma.
As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as Speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study.[7] Also in 1973 Albert appointed Felda Looper as the first female page in the House of Representatives.[8]
Watergate crisis[edit]
In 1973, during Albert's second term as Speaker and Nixon's second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was Governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as Vice President and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties, should that office become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President in October 1973. As the Watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was impeached from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.
This was the first occasion since the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As Speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any Vice Presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself Acting President. However, Albert concluded that, as a Democrat, he had no right to inherit a Presidency that had been won by a Republican ticket in 1972. He later stated that if he had become Acting President by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the House and Senate had confirmed a Republican Vice President. The Vice Presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President in December 1973.
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of Vice President was once more left vacant when Ford was sworn in as President that day. After former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as Vice President in December, any issue of presidential succession was moot.
A different issue arose during Albert's last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.[9][10][11][12]
Retirement[edit]




Official portrait as Speaker


After he left Washington, Albert returned to McAlester, turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns. He died there on February 4, 2000. Albert published his memoirs, with help from university professor Danney Goble, entitled Little Giant (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8061-2250-1). A post-retirement editorial in the New York Times said he was, "... a conciliator and seeker of consensus, a patient persuader . . . trusted for his fairness and integrity."[5]
After retiring from Congress, he went home to Bugtussle, although he maintained an office in McAlester. He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.[5]
Death and legacy[edit]
Albert died at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000.[4]
The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert's life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert's Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s. Carl Albert Indian Health Facility in Ada is part of the Public Health Service) and is administered by the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Durant named its Carl Albert Park for him, and a monument to Albert resides at his birthplace in McAlester. Several institutions and buildings in Oklahoma bear Albert's name. Carl B. Albert Middle School and Carl B. Albert High School in Midwest City and Carl Albert State College in Poteau are named for him.[5]
The University of Oxford established a monument to Albert in the Eunomia Chambers of the St Peter's College Law Library.
Personal life[edit]
Carl Albert married Mary Harmon in 1942; they had a son and a daughter.

Early years, education[edit]
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth his family moved to a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He was the son of a coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame.[1] Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Greek letter fraternity, and a member of the all-male spirit club. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter's College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work, until the start of World War II.
War years[edit]
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served with the Third Armored Division briefly, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant. Most of his service was with the Judge Advocate General Corps. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific.[2] The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David.[3] For his service, Albert earned a Bronze Star, and saw service in the Pacific Theater, where he served in the office of the judge advocate general on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946.[4]
Enters Congress[edit]
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S Truman's containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker's office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and was elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn's death in 1961.[2]
However, Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he "... very much disliked doctrinaire liberals – they want to own your minds. And I don’t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone's inborn political philosophy."[5]
Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.[6]
Majority Congressional Leader[edit]




Majority Leader Albert with President Lyndon B. Johnson


As Majority Leader, Albert was a key figure in advancing the Democratic legislative agenda in the House, particularly with health care legislation. Medicare, the federal program of hospital insurance for persons 65 and older, was initially proposed by the Kennedy Administration as an amendment to the Social Security program. Albert knew the bill had insufficient Congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten key Republicans and eight key southern Democrats. He advised President Kennedy to seek Senate passage of the measure first. Albert calculated that the Senate should bring it to the House as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill, instead of trying direct introduction into the House.
Although well-planned, Albert's efforts on behalf of the Medicare bill were not successful at that time. After the Kennedy assassination, Albert worked to change House rules so that the majority Democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of Congress under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The changes included more majority leverage over the House Rules Committee, and stronger majority membership influence in the House Ways and Means Committee. With these changes in place, Albert was able to push through the Medicare bill, known as the Social Security Act of 1965, and he shepherded other pieces of Johnson's Great Society program through Congress.
Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the convention venue, and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War, and Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race for his party's presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating New Hampshire primary.
Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon's first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert's Chief of Staff was Charles Ward, a respected Washington DC leader and former newspaper editor from Oklahoma.
As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as Speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study.[7] Also in 1973 Albert appointed Felda Looper as the first female page in the House of Representatives.[8]
Watergate crisis[edit]
In 1973, during Albert's second term as Speaker and Nixon's second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was Governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as Vice President and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties, should that office become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President in October 1973. As the Watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was impeached from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.
This was the first occasion since the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As Speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any Vice Presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself Acting President. However, Albert concluded that, as a Democrat, he had no right to inherit a Presidency that had been won by a Republican ticket in 1972. He later stated that if he had become Acting President by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the House and Senate had confirmed a Republican Vice President. The Vice Presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President in December 1973.
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of Vice President was once more left vacant when Ford was sworn in as President that day. After former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as Vice President in December, any issue of presidential succession was moot.
A different issue arose during Albert's last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.[9][10][11][12]
Retirement[edit]




Official portrait as Speaker


After he left Washington, Albert returned to McAlester, turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns. He died there on February 4, 2000. Albert published his memoirs, with help from university professor Danney Goble, entitled Little Giant (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8061-2250-1). A post-retirement editorial in the New York Times said he was, "... a conciliator and seeker of consensus, a patient persuader . . . trusted for his fairness and integrity."[5]
After retiring from Congress, he went home to Bugtussle, although he maintained an office in McAlester. He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.[5]
Death and legacy[edit]
Albert died at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000.[4]
The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert's life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert's Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s. Carl Albert Indian Health Facility in Ada is part of the Public Health Service) and is administered by the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Durant named its Carl Albert Park for him, and a monument to Albert resides at his birthplace in McAlester. Several institutions and buildings in Oklahoma bear Albert's name. Carl B. Albert Middle School and Carl B. Albert High School in Midwest City and Carl Albert State College in Poteau are named for him.[5]
The University of Oxford established a monument to Albert in the Eunomia Chambers of the St Peter's College Law Library.
Personal life[edit]
Carl Albert married Mary Harmon in 1942; they had a son and a daughter.

Early years, education[edit]
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth his family moved to a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He was the son of a coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame.[1] Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Greek letter fraternity, and a member of the all-male spirit club. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter's College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work, until the start of World War II.
War years[edit]
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served with the Third Armored Division briefly, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant. Most of his service was with the Judge Advocate General Corps. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific.[2] The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David.[3] For his service, Albert earned a Bronze Star, and saw service in the Pacific Theater, where he served in the office of the judge advocate general on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946.[4]
Enters Congress[edit]
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S Truman's containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker's office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and was elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn's death in 1961.[2]
However, Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he "... very much disliked doctrinaire liberals – they want to own your minds. And I don’t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone's inborn political philosophy."[5]
Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.[6]

Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the convention venue, and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War, and Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race for his party's presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating New Hampshire primary.
Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon's first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert's Chief of Staff was Charles Ward, a respected Washington DC leader and former newspaper editor from Oklahoma.
As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as Speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study.[7] Also in 1973 Albert appointed Felda Looper as the first female page in the House of Representatives.[8]
Watergate crisis[edit]
In 1973, during Albert's second term as Speaker and Nixon's second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was Governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as Vice President and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties, should that office become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President in October 1973. As the Watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was impeached from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.
This was the first occasion since the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As Speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any Vice Presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself Acting President. However, Albert concluded that, as a Democrat, he had no right to inherit a Presidency that had been won by a Republican ticket in 1972. He later stated that if he had become Acting President by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the House and Senate had confirmed a Republican Vice President. The Vice Presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President in December 1973.
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of Vice President was once more left vacant when Ford was sworn in as President that day. After former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as Vice President in December, any issue of presidential succession was moot.
A different issue arose during Albert's last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.[9][10][11][12]
Retirement[edit]




Official portrait as Speaker


After he left Washington, Albert returned to McAlester, turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns. He died there on February 4, 2000. Albert published his memoirs, with help from university professor Danney Goble, entitled Little Giant (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8061-2250-1). A post-retirement editorial in the New York Times said he was, "... a conciliator and seeker of consensus, a patient persuader . . . trusted for his fairness and integrity."[5]
After retiring from Congress, he went home to Bugtussle, although he maintained an office in McAlester. He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.[5]
Death and legacy[edit]
Albert died at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000.[4]
The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert's life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert's Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s. Carl Albert Indian Health Facility in Ada is part of the Public Health Service) and is administered by the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Durant named its Carl Albert Park for him, and a monument to Albert resides at his birthplace in McAlester. Several institutions and buildings in Oklahoma bear Albert's name. Carl B. Albert Middle School and Carl B. Albert High School in Midwest City and Carl Albert State College in Poteau are named for him.[5]
The University of Oxford established a monument to Albert in the Eunomia Chambers of the St Peter's College Law Library.

Carl Bert Albert (May 10, 1908 – February 4, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 46th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977, representing Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat from 1947 to 1977.
Albert represented a southeastern Oklahoma Congressional district as a Democrat for 30 years, starting in 1947. He is best known for his service as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977. At 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 metres) tall, Albert was often affectionately known as the "Little Giant from Little Dixie", and held the highest political office of any Oklahoman in American history.

Early years, education[edit]
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth his family moved to a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He was the son of a coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame.[1] Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Greek letter fraternity, and a member of the all-male spirit club. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter's College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work, until the start of World War II.
War years[edit]
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served with the Third Armored Division briefly, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant. Most of his service was with the Judge Advocate General Corps. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific.[2] The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David.[3] For his service, Albert earned a Bronze Star, and saw service in the Pacific Theater, where he served in the office of the judge advocate general on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946.[4]
Enters Congress[edit]
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S Truman's containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker's office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and was elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn's death in 1961.[2]
However, Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he "... very much disliked doctrinaire liberals – they want to own your minds. And I don’t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone's inborn political philosophy."[5]
Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.[6]
Majority Congressional Leader[edit]




Majority Leader Albert with President Lyndon B. Johnson


As Majority Leader, Albert was a key figure in advancing the Democratic legislative agenda in the House, particularly with health care legislation. Medicare, the federal program of hospital insurance for persons 65 and older, was initially proposed by the Kennedy Administration as an amendment to the Social Security program. Albert knew the bill had insufficient Congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten key Republicans and eight key southern Democrats. He advised President Kennedy to seek Senate passage of the measure first. Albert calculated that the Senate should bring it to the House as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill, instead of trying direct introduction into the House.
Although well-planned, Albert's efforts on behalf of the Medicare bill were not successful at that time. After the Kennedy assassination, Albert worked to change House rules so that the majority Democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of Congress under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The changes included more majority leverage over the House Rules Committee, and stronger majority membership influence in the House Ways and Means Committee. With these changes in place, Albert was able to push through the Medicare bill, known as the Social Security Act of 1965, and he shepherded other pieces of Johnson's Great Society program through Congress.
Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the convention venue, and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War, and Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race for his party's presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating New Hampshire primary.
Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon's first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert's Chief of Staff was Charles Ward, a respected Washington DC leader and former newspaper editor from Oklahoma.
As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as Speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study.[7] Also in 1973 Albert appointed Felda Looper as the first female page in the House of Representatives.[8]
Watergate crisis[edit]
In 1973, during Albert's second term as Speaker and Nixon's second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was Governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as Vice President and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties, should that office become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President in October 1973. As the Watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was impeached from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.
This was the first occasion since the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As Speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any Vice Presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself Acting President. However, Albert concluded that, as a Democrat, he had no right to inherit a Presidency that had been won by a Republican ticket in 1972. He later stated that if he had become Acting President by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the House and Senate had confirmed a Republican Vice President. The Vice Presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President in December 1973.
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of Vice President was once more left vacant when Ford was sworn in as President that day. After former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as Vice President in December, any issue of presidential succession was moot.
A different issue arose during Albert's last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.[9][10][11][12]
Retirement[edit]

After retiring from Congress, he went home to Bugtussle, although he maintained an office in McAlester. He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.[5]
Death and legacy[edit]
Albert died at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000.[4]
The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert's life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert's Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s.

Carl Bert Albert (May 10, 1908 – February 4, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 46th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977, representing Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district as a Democrat from 1947 to 1977.
Albert represented a southeastern Oklahoma Congressional district as a Democrat for 30 years, starting in 1947. He is best known for his service as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977. At 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 metres) tall, Albert was often affectionately known as the "Little Giant from Little Dixie", and held the highest political office of any Oklahoman in American history.

Early years, education[edit]
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth his family moved to a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He was the son of a coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame.[1] Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Greek letter fraternity, and a member of the all-male spirit club. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter's College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work, until the start of World War II.
War years[edit]
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served with the Third Armored Division briefly, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant. Most of his service was with the Judge Advocate General Corps. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific.[2] The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David.[3] For his service, Albert earned a Bronze Star, and saw service in the Pacific Theater, where he served in the office of the judge advocate general on the staff of General Douglas MacArthur. He left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946.[4]
Enters Congress[edit]
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S Truman's containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker's office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and was elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn's death in 1961.[2]
However, Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he "... very much disliked doctrinaire liberals – they want to own your minds. And I don’t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone's inborn political philosophy."[5]
Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.[6]
Majority Congressional Leader[edit]




Majority Leader Albert with President Lyndon B. Johnson


As Majority Leader, Albert was a key figure in advancing the Democratic legislative agenda in the House, particularly with health care legislation. Medicare, the federal program of hospital insurance for persons 65 and older, was initially proposed by the Kennedy Administration as an amendment to the Social Security program. Albert knew the bill had insufficient Congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten key Republicans and eight key southern Democrats. He advised President Kennedy to seek Senate passage of the measure first. Albert calculated that the Senate should bring it to the House as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill, instead of trying direct introduction into the House.
Although well-planned, Albert's efforts on behalf of the Medicare bill were not successful at that time. After the Kennedy assassination, Albert worked to change House rules so that the majority Democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of Congress under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The changes included more majority leverage over the House Rules Committee, and stronger majority membership influence in the House Ways and Means Committee. With these changes in place, Albert was able to push through the Medicare bill, known as the Social Security Act of 1965, and he shepherded other pieces of Johnson's Great Society program through Congress.
Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the convention venue, and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War, and Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race for his party's presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating New Hampshire primary.
Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon's first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert's Chief of Staff was Charles Ward, a respected Washington DC leader and former newspaper editor from Oklahoma.
As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as Speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study.[7] Also in 1973 Albert appointed Felda Looper as the first female page in the House of Representatives.[8]
Watergate crisis[edit]
In 1973, during Albert's second term as Speaker and Nixon's second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was Governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as Vice President and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties, should that office become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President in October 1973. As the Watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was impeached from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become Acting President under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.
This was the first occasion since the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As Speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any Vice Presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself Acting President. However, Albert concluded that, as a Democrat, he had no right to inherit a Presidency that had been won by a Republican ticket in 1972. He later stated that if he had become Acting President by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the House and Senate had confirmed a Republican Vice President. The Vice Presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President in December 1973.
Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of Vice President was once more left vacant when Ford was sworn in as President that day. After former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as Vice President in December, any issue of presidential succession was moot.
A different issue arose during Albert's last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.[9][10][11][12]
Retirement[edit]




Official portrait as Speaker


After he left Washington, Albert returned to McAlester, turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns. He died there on February 4, 2000. Albert published his memoirs, with help from university professor Danney Goble, entitled Little Giant (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8061-2250-1). A post-retirement editorial in the New York Times said he was, "... a conciliator and seeker of consensus, a patient persuader . . . trusted for his fairness and integrity."[5]
After retiring from Congress, he went home to Bugtussle, although he maintained an office in McAlester. He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.[5]
Death and legacy[edit]
Albert died at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000.[4]
The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert's life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert's Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s. Carl Albert Indian Health Facility in Ada is part of the Public Health Service) and is administered by the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Durant named its Carl Albert Park for him, and a monument to Albert resides at his birthplace in McAlester. Several institutions and buildings in Oklahoma bear Albert's name. Carl B. Albert Middle School and Carl B. Albert High School in Midwest City and Carl Albert State College in Poteau are named for him.[5]
The University of Oxford established a monument to Albert in the Eunomia Chambers of the St Peter's College Law Library.
Personal life[edit]
Carl Albert married Mary Harmon in 1942; they had a son and a daughter.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


Alfred C. Fuller began what was to become Fuller Brush Company in a basement shop in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1906 he moved to Hartford, Connecticut and founded the company.[3]
The company began with door-to-door sales of brushes of various sorts, including hairbrushes with a lifetime guarantee for which they are famous.[4]
In 1931, the establishment of the first of what became known as the Green River Ordinance led Fuller Brush to challenge the ordinance's limits on door-to-door sales; the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where on March 1, 1937 it dismissed the appeal "for want of a substantial federal question."[5]
In the mid 1930s, Fuller relocated from rented space on Union Place opposite Hartford's railroad station, to a purpose-built sprawling factory and office complex on North Main St at the Windsor town line.
World War II saw the company "cut its normal civilian output drastically to make brushes for the cleaning of guns"; Fuller's son Howard became president in 1943.[3] After the war, Fuller added Daggett & Ramsdell, Inc.'s Débutante Cosmetics to its line of products it sold house-to-house, sold by a sales force of women, a strategy resurrected after a wartime attempt to have "Fullerettes" sell their core products.[3] Fuller had evidence that women could succeed at sales since Stanley Beveridge, who had left his position as Fuller's sales vice president in 1929, had by 1949 employed women as "dealers" to grow sales at his own company, Stanley Home Products, to $35 million, exceeding Fuller's sales for the first time.[6]
Fuller's oldest son Howard succeeded his father as president, serving until he and his wife Dora died in the high-speed crash of his Mercedes 300SL gullwing sports car in New Mexico in May 1959.[4]
1959 to 1994[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


In 1959, Avard E. Fuller, 44, the founder's younger son, became Fuller Brush's president.[7]
Having long outgrown the Hartford location, in 1960, the company moved to a new, purpose-built campus on Long Hill St. in East Hartford, Conn.
In 1966, Fuller Brush hired 17,500 women, motivated by the lack of qualified men (the unemployment rate was 3.8%) and the example set by Avon Products.[8]
Consolidated Foods, now Sara Lee Corporation, acquired Fuller Brush in 1968;[9] Avard Fuller retired a year later.[7] Office operations moved initially to Niles, Ill., then relocated along with manufacturing and research to Great Bend, Kans in 1973.[4]
By 1985, all of the company's sales were still generated door-to-door.[9] By the mid-1980s, in recognition of the decrease in the number of women at home during the day, Fuller Brush began introducing other sales channels beyond door-to-door, including a mail-order catalog that sent out 10 million catalogs a year, and several outlet stores selling "slow-selling items, returned merchandise or slightly flawed goods"; by mid-1989, 35% of that year's estimated $160 million in sales came from catalogs, with another 5% coming from its stores.[9] Later that same year, a group of investors from Kansas headed by Lee Turner, a trial lawyer, took Fuller private; by 1991 the company now known as Fuller Industries and led by Stuart A. Ochiltree, had integrated its door-to-door and catalog business, with its 12,000 mostly part-time sales representatives receiving commissions for sales from either channel.[10]
CPAC subsidiary[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


In June 1994, Fuller, once again known as Fuller Brush Company, was acquired by CPAC Inc., a Leicester, New York-based manufacturer of photographic chemicals; CPAC took on the "heavy debt burden" accumulated while the company was private and whose annual sales, increasingly focused on chemicals, had shrunk to $24 million.[11]
In 2007, CPAC Inc. was acquired by Buckingham Capital Partners in a leveraged buyout.[1]
In February, 2012, Fuller Brush Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[12]
Victory Park Capital and David Sabin[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2012)


In December, 2012, Victory Park Capital and CEO, David Sabin, bought the iconic American company out of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The headquarters were moved from Great Bend, Kansas to Napa, California.[13]

The main factory for the Fuller Brush Company was located in East Hartford, Connecticut during the 1960s,[citation needed] where Fuller's son Avard ran the company. It had moved from Hartford on the other side of the Connecticut River some years earlier. The Research Division was there, led by Hank Whitman, along with the plastics molding operation.
The Industrial Division, under Verne Joy, was also at the East Hartford plant, where they made large motor-driven brushes for developing newspaper printing photo metal plates.[citation needed] All the mops were sewn at this plant. The perfuming operation was there also, including a large machine to detect what was in perfume made by other companies.[citation needed]
In front of the East Hartford plant was a large glass case with a stuffed large boar that represented the boar hair used in some of the original Fuller brushes.[citation needed]
Fuller had a "private label" division, Charter Products, that sold duplicate products under other brand names chosen by the distributor. Avard's interest in boating resulted in experiments at the plant with plastic molding of port lights (windows) for boats, including full plastic hardware.[citation needed]
New York[edit]
The plastic bottle and toothbrush manufacturing operation was in Philmont, New York.[citation needed] According to Fuller's memoir, Fuller Brush distributed the Bristlecomb, a hairbrush introduced by the Mohawk Company in 1928. In 1942, Fuller Brush bought out the Mohawk Brush Company and subsequently all the hairbrushes and industrial floor brushes were manufactured at the Mohawk Plant in Albany, New York.[14]
Great Bend, Kansas[edit]
Since 1973,[citation needed] Fuller brushes and over 2,000[citation needed] other Fuller products have been manufactured in Barton County, near Great Bend, Kansas.
Napa, California[edit]
Headquarters for this iconic brand were moved from Kansas to California shortly after being purchased by David Sabin and Victory Park Capital, while the manufacturing remains in Great Bend, KS.
Former employees[edit]
Former employees include evangelist Billy Graham, who became a Fuller Brush salesman during the summer after high school, and outsold "every other salesman in North Carolina";[15] in his 1997 autobiography, Just As I Am, Graham describes in some detail his experiences selling Fuller brushes door-to-door. Ellen Barkin was "born in the Bronx to a father who worked as a Fuller Brush man".[16] Clifford Irving "was a Fuller Brush man in Syracuse."[17]
More recently, Groundlings Theater veteran Paul Reubens, of Pee-wee Herman fame, worked as a Fuller Brush salesman while attending California Institute of the Arts.[18]
Other former employees include Frank Gross, photographer Tom Leutwiler, Dennis Quaid, Dick Clark, J. Bruce Llewellyn (co-founder of 100 Black Men of America), Ed Mirvish, Jack Sensenbrenner, Kin Shriner, and Ed Stelmach. Jack Nicholson and Felicia Farr were also featured in a few pictures in "The Fuller Magazine." Broadcaster Lowell Green admitted during his April 24, 2014 program to selling Fuller Brushes in Montreal's Westmount area during his college days in the 1950s.
In popular culture[edit]

The Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as a Jewish Fuller Brush salesman in Disney's 1933 Academy Award-winning Silly Symphonies version of Three Little Pigs.
In Warner Brothers's 1944 cartoon "Duck Soup to Nuts," Daffy Duck induces Porky Pig to open the window of his diving helmet by knocking on it and declaring, "It's The Fuller Brush Man!"
The company also inspired two comedy films, The Fuller Brush Man, a 1948 movie starring Red Skelton and Janet Blair, and The Fuller Brush Girl, a 1950 movie starring Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert.
The Fuller Brush salesman is mentioned by rock and roots artist James McMurtry in the song Fuller Brush Man. The song appears on his 1995 release, Where'd You Hide The Body, released by Columbia Records.
The 1972 song by John Prine, "The Frying Pan," from his album Diamonds in the Rough, begins with the line, "I came home from work this evening, there was a note in the frying pan, it said cook your own supper babe, I've run off with the Fuller Brush Man."
A line in the song "Sneakin' Around" from the 1982 movie The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas mentions "dirty jokes about the Fuller brush man."
In the 1987 episode "Much Ad About Scrooge" of Disney's DuckTales, Uncle Scrooge is fast-talked into letting a Fuller Brush salesman into his house.
In Donnie Brasco (film), Maggie Pistone (impersonated by Anne Heche) quips to her visiting husband Joe (who was using the alias Donald Brasco at the time described in the film and was impersonated in the film by Johnny Depp) that their two daughters might not recognize him due to his infrequent presence at home, "They might think you're the Fuller brush man."
In the 2008 film Billy: The Early Years, famed evangelist Billy Graham, impersonated in the film by Armie Hammer, has a summer job in his college years as a door-to-door Fuller brush salesman. (Graham's autobiography Just As I Am refers to exactly this activity on his part, as mentioned above.)
Often referred to as San Francisco’s last door-to-door salesman, as of 2013, Norman Hall continues to sell Fuller Brush products in the Bay Area and was interviewed on Radio Sausalito.[19]
In August 2013, the company was featured on the AMC reality series "The Pitch" where a group of advertising agencies compete to pitch advertising campaigns to Sabin and his team at Fuller Brush. The Monogram Group won the account with the slogan 'live fuller.' [13]

By 1985, all of the company's sales were still generated door-to-door.[9] By the mid-1980s, in recognition of the decrease in the number of women at home during the day, Fuller Brush began introducing other sales channels beyond door-to-door, including a mail-order catalog that sent out 10 million catalogs a year, and several outlet stores selling "slow-selling items, returned merchandise or slightly flawed goods"; by mid-1989, 35% of that year's estimated $160 million in sales came from catalogs, with another 5% coming from its stores.[9] Later that same year, a group of investors from Kansas headed by Lee Turner, a trial lawyer, took Fuller private; by 1991 the company now known as Fuller Industries and led by Stuart A. Ochiltree, had integrated its door-to-door and catalog business, with its 12,000 mostly part-time sales representatives receiving commissions for sales from either channel.[10]

In June 1994, Fuller, once again known as Fuller Brush Company, was acquired by CPAC Inc., a Leicester, New York-based manufacturer of photographic chemicals; CPAC took on the "heavy debt burden" accumulated while the company was private and whose annual sales, increasingly focused on chemicals, had shrunk to $24 million.[11]
In 2007, CPAC Inc. was acquired by Buckingham Capital Partners in a leveraged buyout.[1]
In February, 2012, Fuller Brush Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[12]

The main factory for the Fuller Brush Company was located in East Hartford, Connecticut during the 1960s,[citation needed] where Fuller's son Avard ran the company. It had moved from Hartford on the other side of the Connecticut River some years earlier. The Research Division was there, led by Hank Whitman, along with the plastics molding operation.
The Industrial Division, under Verne Joy, was also at the East Hartford plant, where they made large motor-driven brushes for developing newspaper printing photo metal plates.[citation needed] All the mops were sewn at this plant. The perfuming operation was there also, including a large machine to detect what was in perfume made by other companies.[citation needed]
In front of the East Hartford plant was a large glass case with a stuffed large boar that represented the boar hair used in some of the original Fuller brushes.[citation needed]
Fuller had a "private label" division, Charter Products, that sold duplicate products under other brand names chosen by the distributor. Avard's interest in boating resulted in experiments at the plant with plastic molding of port lights (windows) for boats, including full plastic hardware.[citation needed]
New York[edit]
The plastic bottle and toothbrush manufacturing operation was in Philmont, New York.[citation needed] According to Fuller's memoir, Fuller Brush distributed the Bristlecomb, a hairbrush introduced by the Mohawk Company in 1928. In 1942, Fuller Brush bought out the Mohawk Brush Company and subsequently all the hairbrushes and industrial floor brushes were manufactured at the Mohawk Plant in Albany, New York.[14]
Great Bend, Kansas[edit]
Since 1973,[citation needed] Fuller brushes and over 2,000[citation needed] other Fuller products have been manufactured in Barton County, near Great Bend, Kansas.
Napa, California[edit]
Headquarters for this iconic brand were moved from Kansas to California shortly after being purchased by David Sabin and Victory Park Capital, while the manufacturing remains in Great Bend, KS.
Former employees[edit]
Former employees include evangelist Billy Graham, who became a Fuller Brush salesman during the summer after high school, and outsold "every other salesman in North Carolina";[15] in his 1997 autobiography, Just As I Am, Graham describes in some detail his experiences selling Fuller brushes door-to-door. Ellen Barkin was "born in the Bronx to a father who worked as a Fuller Brush man".[16] Clifford Irving "was a Fuller Brush man in Syracuse."[17]
More recently, Groundlings Theater veteran Paul Reubens, of Pee-wee Herman fame, worked as a Fuller Brush salesman while attending California Institute of the Arts.[18]
Other former employees include Frank Gross, photographer Tom Leutwiler, Dennis Quaid, Dick Clark, J. Bruce Llewellyn (co-founder of 100 Black Men of America), Ed Mirvish, Jack Sensenbrenner, Kin Shriner, and Ed Stelmach. Jack Nicholson and Felicia Farr were also featured in a few pictures in "The Fuller Magazine." Broadcaster Lowell Green admitted during his April 24, 2014 program to selling Fuller Brushes in Montreal's Westmount area during his college days in the 1950s.
In popular culture[edit]

The Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as a Jewish Fuller Brush salesman in Disney's 1933 Academy Award-winning Silly Symphonies version of Three Little Pigs.
In Warner Brothers's 1944 cartoon "Duck Soup to Nuts," Daffy Duck induces Porky Pig to open the window of his diving helmet by knocking on it and declaring, "It's The Fuller Brush Man!"
The company also inspired two comedy films, The Fuller Brush Man, a 1948 movie starring Red Skelton and Janet Blair, and The Fuller Brush Girl, a 1950 movie starring Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert.
The Fuller Brush salesman is mentioned by rock and roots artist James McMurtry in the song Fuller Brush Man. The song appears on his 1995 release, Where'd You Hide The Body, released by Columbia Records.
The 1972 song by John Prine, "The Frying Pan," from his album Diamonds in the Rough, begins with the line, "I came home from work this evening, there was a note in the frying pan, it said cook your own supper babe, I've run off with the Fuller Brush Man."
A line in the song "Sneakin' Around" from the 1982 movie The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas mentions "dirty jokes about the Fuller brush man."
In the 1987 episode "Much Ad About Scrooge" of Disney's DuckTales, Uncle Scrooge is fast-talked into letting a Fuller Brush salesman into his house.
In Donnie Brasco (film), Maggie Pistone (impersonated by Anne Heche) quips to her visiting husband Joe (who was using the alias Donald Brasco at the time described in the film and was impersonated in the film by Johnny Depp) that their two daughters might not recognize him due to his infrequent presence at home, "They might think you're the Fuller brush man."
In the 2008 film Billy: The Early Years, famed evangelist Billy Graham, impersonated in the film by Armie Hammer, has a summer job in his college years as a door-to-door Fuller brush salesman. (Graham's autobiography Just As I Am refers to exactly this activity on his part, as mentioned above.)
Often referred to as San Francisco’s last door-to-door salesman, as of 2013, Norman Hall continues to sell Fuller Brush products in the Bay Area and was interviewed on Radio Sausalito.[19]
In August 2013, the company was featured on the AMC reality series "The Pitch" where a group of advertising agencies compete to pitch advertising campaigns to Sabin and his team at Fuller Brush. The Monogram Group won the account with the slogan 'live fuller.' [13]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


Alfred C. Fuller began what was to become Fuller Brush Company in a basement shop in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1906 he moved to Hartford, Connecticut and founded the company.[3]
The company began with door-to-door sales of brushes of various sorts, including hairbrushes with a lifetime guarantee for which they are famous.[4]
In 1931, the establishment of the first of what became known as the Green River Ordinance led Fuller Brush to challenge the ordinance's limits on door-to-door sales; the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where on March 1, 1937 it dismissed the appeal "for want of a substantial federal question."[5]
In the mid 1930s, Fuller relocated from rented space on Union Place opposite Hartford's railroad station, to a purpose-built sprawling factory and office complex on North Main St at the Windsor town line.
World War II saw the company "cut its normal civilian output drastically to make brushes for the cleaning of guns"; Fuller's son Howard became president in 1943.[3] After the war, Fuller added Daggett & Ramsdell, Inc.'s Débutante Cosmetics to its line of products it sold house-to-house, sold by a sales force of women, a strategy resurrected after a wartime attempt to have "Fullerettes" sell their core products.[3] Fuller had evidence that women could succeed at sales since Stanley Beveridge, who had left his position as Fuller's sales vice president in 1929, had by 1949 employed women as "dealers" to grow sales at his own company, Stanley Home Products, to $35 million, exceeding Fuller's sales for the first time.[6]
Fuller's oldest son Howard succeeded his father as president, serving until he and his wife Dora died in the high-speed crash of his Mercedes 300SL gullwing sports car in New Mexico in May 1959.[4]
1959 to 1994[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


In 1959, Avard E. Fuller, 44, the founder's younger son, became Fuller Brush's president.[7]
Having long outgrown the Hartford location, in 1960, the company moved to a new, purpose-built campus on Long Hill St. in East Hartford, Conn.
In 1966, Fuller Brush hired 17,500 women, motivated by the lack of qualified men (the unemployment rate was 3.8%) and the example set by Avon Products.[8]
Consolidated Foods, now Sara Lee Corporation, acquired Fuller Brush in 1968;[9] Avard Fuller retired a year later.[7] Office operations moved initially to Niles, Ill., then relocated along with manufacturing and research to Great Bend, Kans in 1973.[4]
By 1985, all of the company's sales were still generated door-to-door.[9] By the mid-1980s, in recognition of the decrease in the number of women at home during the day, Fuller Brush began introducing other sales channels beyond door-to-door, including a mail-order catalog that sent out 10 million catalogs a year, and several outlet stores selling "slow-selling items, returned merchandise or slightly flawed goods"; by mid-1989, 35% of that year's estimated $160 million in sales came from catalogs, with another 5% coming from its stores.[9] Later that same year, a group of investors from Kansas headed by Lee Turner, a trial lawyer, took Fuller private; by 1991 the company now known as Fuller Industries and led by Stuart A. Ochiltree, had integrated its door-to-door and catalog business, with its 12,000 mostly part-time sales representatives receiving commissions for sales from either channel.[10]
CPAC subsidiary[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


In June 1994, Fuller, once again known as Fuller Brush Company, was acquired by CPAC Inc., a Leicester, New York-based manufacturer of photographic chemicals; CPAC took on the "heavy debt burden" accumulated while the company was private and whose annual sales, increasingly focused on chemicals, had shrunk to $24 million.[11]
In 2007, CPAC Inc. was acquired by Buckingham Capital Partners in a leveraged buyout.[1]
In February, 2012, Fuller Brush Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[12]
Victory Park Capital and David Sabin[edit]

It had moved from Hartford on the other side of the Connecticut River some years earlier. The Research Division was there, led by Hank Whitman, along with the plastics molding operation.
The Industrial Division, under Verne Joy, was also at the East Hartford plant, where they made large motor-driven brushes for developing newspaper printing photo metal plates.[citation needed] All the mops were sewn at this plant. The perfuming operation was there also, including a large machine to detect what was in perfume made by other companies.[citation needed]
In front of the East Hartford plant was a large glass case with a stuffed large boar that represented the boar hair used in some of the original Fuller brushes.[citation needed]
Fuller had a "private label" division, Charter Products, that sold duplicate products under other brand names chosen by the distributor. Avard's interest in boating resulted in experiments at the plant with plastic molding of port lights (windows) for boats, including full plastic hardware.[citation needed]
New York[edit]
The plastic bottle and toothbrush manufacturing operation was in Philmont, New York.[citation needed] According to Fuller's memoir, Fuller Brush distributed the Bristlecomb, a hairbrush introduced by the Mohawk Company in 1928. In 1942, Fuller Brush bought out the Mohawk Brush Company and subsequently all the hairbrushes and industrial floor brushes were manufactured at the Mohawk Plant in Albany, New York.[14]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


Alfred C. Fuller began what was to become Fuller Brush Company in a basement shop in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1906 he moved to Hartford, Connecticut and founded the company.[3]
The company began with door-to-door sales of brushes of various sorts, including hairbrushes with a lifetime guarantee for which they are famous.[4]
In 1931, the establishment of the first of what became known as the Green River Ordinance led Fuller Brush to challenge the ordinance's limits on door-to-door sales; the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where on March 1, 1937 it dismissed the appeal "for want of a substantial federal question."[5]
In the mid 1930s, Fuller relocated from rented space on Union Place opposite Hartford's railroad station, to a purpose-built sprawling factory and office complex on North Main St at the Windsor town line.
World War II saw the company "cut its normal civilian output drastically to make brushes for the cleaning of guns"; Fuller's son Howard became president in 1943.[3] After the war, Fuller added Daggett & Ramsdell, Inc.'s Débutante Cosmetics to its line of products it sold house-to-house, sold by a sales force of women, a strategy resurrected after a wartime attempt to have "Fullerettes" sell their core products.[3] Fuller had evidence that women could succeed at sales since Stanley Beveridge, who had left his position as Fuller's sales vice president in 1929, had by 1949 employed women as "dealers" to grow sales at his own company, Stanley Home Products, to $35 million, exceeding Fuller's sales for the first time.[6]
Fuller's oldest son Howard succeeded his father as president, serving until he and his wife Dora died in the high-speed crash of his Mercedes 300SL gullwing sports car in New Mexico in May 1959.[4]
1959 to 1994[edit]

In 1959, Avard E. Fuller, 44, the founder's younger son, became Fuller Brush's president.[7]
Having long outgrown the Hartford location, in 1960, the company moved to a new, purpose-built campus on Long Hill St. in East Hartford, Conn.
In 1966, Fuller Brush hired 17,500 women, motivated by the lack of qualified men (the unemployment rate was 3.8%) and the example set by Avon Products.[8]
Consolidated Foods, now Sara Lee Corporation, acquired Fuller Brush in 1968;[9] Avard Fuller retired a year later.[7] Office operations moved initially to Niles, Ill., then relocated along with manufacturing and research to Great Bend, Kans in 1973.[4]
By 1985, all of the company's sales were still generated door-to-door.[9] By the mid-1980s, in recognition of the decrease in the number of women at home during the day, Fuller Brush began introducing other sales channels beyond door-to-door, including a mail-order catalog that sent out 10 million catalogs a year, and several outlet stores selling "slow-selling items, returned merchandise or slightly flawed goods"; by mid-1989, 35% of that year's estimated $160 million in sales came from catalogs, with another 5% coming from its stores.[9] Later that same year, a group of investors from Kansas headed by Lee Turner, a trial lawyer, took Fuller private; by 1991 the company now known as Fuller Industries and led by Stuart A. Ochiltree, had integrated its door-to-door and catalog business, with its 12,000 mostly part-time sales representatives receiving commissions for sales from either channel.[10]
CPAC subsidiary[edit]

In June 1994, Fuller, once again known as Fuller Brush Company, was acquired by CPAC Inc., a Leicester, New York-based manufacturer of photographic chemicals; CPAC took on the "heavy debt burden" accumulated while the company was private and whose annual sales, increasingly focused on chemicals, had shrunk to $24 million.[11]
In 2007, CPAC Inc. was acquired by Buckingham Capital Partners in a leveraged buyout.[1]
In February, 2012, Fuller Brush Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[12]
Victory Park Capital and David Sabin[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2012)


In December, 2012, Victory Park Capital and CEO, David Sabin, bought the iconic American company out of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The headquarters were moved from Great Bend, Kansas to Napa, California.[13]

The main factory for the Fuller Brush Company was located in East Hartford, Connecticut during the 1960s,[citation needed] where Fuller's son Avard ran the company. It had moved from Hartford on the other side of the Connecticut River some years earlier. The Research Division was there, led by Hank Whitman, along with the plastics molding operation.
The Industrial Division, under Verne Joy, was also at the East Hartford plant, where they made large motor-driven brushes for developing newspaper printing photo metal plates.[citation needed] All the mops were sewn at this plant. The perfuming operation was there also, including a large machine to detect what was in perfume made by other companies.[citation needed]
In front of the East Hartford plant was a large glass case with a stuffed large boar that represented the boar hair used in some of the original Fuller brushes.[citation needed]
Fuller had a "private label" division, Charter Products, that sold duplicate products under other brand names chosen by the distributor. Avard's interest in boating resulted in experiments at the plant with plastic molding of port lights (windows) for boats, including full plastic hardware.[citation needed]
New York[edit]
The plastic bottle and toothbrush manufacturing operation was in Philmont, New York.[citation needed] According to Fuller's memoir, Fuller Brush distributed the Bristlecomb, a hairbrush introduced by the Mohawk Company in 1928. In 1942, Fuller Brush bought out the Mohawk Brush Company and subsequently all the hairbrushes and industrial floor brushes were manufactured at the Mohawk Plant in Albany, New York.[14]
Great Bend, Kansas[edit]
Since 1973,[citation needed] Fuller brushes and over 2,000[citation needed] other Fuller products have been manufactured in Barton County, near Great Bend, Kansas.
Napa, California[edit]
Headquarters for this iconic brand were moved from Kansas to California shortly after being purchased by David Sabin and Victory Park Capital, while the manufacturing remains in Great Bend, KS.
Former employees[edit]
Former employees include evangelist Billy Graham, who became a Fuller Brush salesman during the summer after high school, and outsold "every other salesman in North Carolina";[15] in his 1997 autobiography, Just As I Am, Graham describes in some detail his experiences selling Fuller brushes door-to-door. Ellen Barkin was "born in the Bronx to a father who worked as a Fuller Brush man".[16] Clifford Irving "was a Fuller Brush man in Syracuse."[17]
More recently, Groundlings Theater veteran Paul Reubens, of Pee-wee Herman fame, worked as a Fuller Brush salesman while attending California Institute of the Arts.[18]
Other former employees include Frank Gross, photographer Tom Leutwiler, Dennis Quaid, Dick Clark, J. Bruce Llewellyn (co-founder of 100 Black Men of America), Ed Mirvish, Jack Sensenbrenner, Kin Shriner, and Ed Stelmach. Jack Nicholson and Felicia Farr were also featured in a few pictures in "The Fuller Magazine." Broadcaster Lowell Green admitted during his April 24, 2014 program to selling Fuller Brushes in Montreal's Westmount area during his college days in the 1950s.
In popular culture[edit]

The Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as a Jewish Fuller Brush salesman in Disney's 1933 Academy Award-winning Silly Symphonies version of Three Little Pigs.
In Warner Brothers's 1944 cartoon "Duck Soup to Nuts," Daffy Duck induces Porky Pig to open the window of his diving helmet by knocking on it and declaring, "It's The Fuller Brush Man!"
The company also inspired two comedy films, The Fuller Brush Man, a 1948 movie starring Red Skelton and Janet Blair, and The Fuller Brush Girl, a 1950 movie starring Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert.
The Fuller Brush salesman is mentioned by rock and roots artist James McMurtry in the song Fuller Brush Man. The song appears on his 1995 release, Where'd You Hide The Body, released by Columbia Records.
The 1972 song by John Prine, "The Frying Pan," from his album Diamonds in the Rough, begins with the line, "I came home from work this evening, there was a note in the frying pan, it said cook your own supper babe, I've run off with the Fuller Brush Man."
A line in the song "Sneakin' Around" from the 1982 movie The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas mentions "dirty jokes about the Fuller brush man."
In the 1987 episode "Much Ad About Scrooge" of Disney's DuckTales, Uncle Scrooge is fast-talked into letting a Fuller Brush salesman into his house.
In Donnie Brasco (film), Maggie Pistone (impersonated by Anne Heche) quips to her visiting husband Joe (who was using the alias Donald Brasco at the time described in the film and was impersonated in the film by Johnny Depp) that their two daughters might not recognize him due to his infrequent presence at home, "They might think you're the Fuller brush man."
In the 2008 film Billy: The Early Years, famed evangelist Billy Graham, impersonated in the film by Armie Hammer, has a summer job in his college years as a door-to-door Fuller brush salesman. (Graham's autobiography Just As I Am refers to exactly this activity on his part, as mentioned above.)
Often referred to as San Francisco’s last door-to-door salesman, as of 2013, Norman Hall continues to sell Fuller Brush products in the Bay Area and was interviewed on Radio Sausalito.[19]
In August 2013, the company was featured on the AMC reality series "The Pitch" where a group of advertising agencies compete to pitch advertising campaigns to Sabin and his team at Fuller Brush. The Monogram Group won the account with the slogan 'live fuller.' [13]

The company began with door-to-door sales of brushes of various sorts, including hairbrushes with a lifetime guarantee for which they are famous.[4]
In 1931, the establishment of the first of what became known as the Green River Ordinance led Fuller Brush to challenge the ordinance's limits on door-to-door sales; the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where on March 1, 1937 it dismissed the appeal "for want of a substantial federal question."[5]
In the mid 1930s, Fuller relocated from rented space on Union Place opposite Hartford's railroad station, to a purpose-built sprawling factory and office complex on North Main St at the Windsor town line.
World War II saw the company "cut its normal civilian output drastically to make brushes for the cleaning of guns"; Fuller's son Howard became president in 1943.[3] After the war, Fuller added Daggett & Ramsdell, Inc.'s Débutante Cosmetics to its line of products it sold house-to-house, sold by a sales force of women, a strategy resurrected after a wartime attempt to have "Fullerettes" sell their core products.[3] Fuller had evidence that women could succeed at sales since Stanley Beveridge, who had left his position as Fuller's sales vice president in 1929, had by 1949 employed women as "dealers" to grow sales at his own company, Stanley Home Products, to $35 million, exceeding Fuller's sales for the first time.[6]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


Alfred C. Fuller began what was to become Fuller Brush Company in a basement shop in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1906 he moved to Hartford, Connecticut and founded the company.[3]
The company began with door-to-door sales of brushes of various sorts, including hairbrushes with a lifetime guarantee for which they are famous.[4]
In 1931, the establishment of the first of what became known as the Green River Ordinance led Fuller Brush to challenge the ordinance's limits on door-to-door sales; the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where on March 1, 1937 it dismissed the appeal "for want of a substantial federal question."[5]
In the mid 1930s, Fuller relocated from rented space on Union Place opposite Hartford's railroad station, to a purpose-built sprawling factory and office complex on North Main St at the Windsor town line.
World War II saw the company "cut its normal civilian output drastically to make brushes for the cleaning of guns"; Fuller's son Howard became president in 1943.[3] After the war, Fuller added Daggett & Ramsdell, Inc.'s Débutante Cosmetics to its line of products it sold house-to-house, sold by a sales force of women, a strategy resurrected after a wartime attempt to have "Fullerettes" sell their core products.[3] Fuller had evidence that women could succeed at sales since Stanley Beveridge, who had left his position as Fuller's sales vice president in 1929, had by 1949 employed women as "dealers" to grow sales at his own company, Stanley Home Products, to $35 million, exceeding Fuller's sales for the first time.[6]
Fuller's oldest son Howard succeeded his father as president, serving until he and his wife Dora died in the high-speed crash of his Mercedes 300SL gullwing sports car in New Mexico in May 1959.[4]
1959 to 1994[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2011)


In 1959, Avard E. Fuller, 44, the founder's younger son, became Fuller Brush's president.[7]
Having long outgrown the Hartford location, in 1960, the company moved to a new, purpose-built campus on Long Hill St. in East Hartford, Conn.
In 1966, Fuller Brush hired 17,500 women, motivated by the lack of qualified men (the unemployment rate was 3.8%) and the example set by Avon Products.[8]
Consolidated Foods, now Sara Lee Corporation, acquired Fuller Brush in 1968;[9] Avard Fuller retired a year later.[7] Office operations moved initially to Niles, Ill., then relocated along with manufacturing and research to Great Bend, Kans in 1973.[4]
By 1985, all of the company's sales were still generated door-to-door.[9] By the mid-1980s, in recognition of the decrease in the number of women at home during the day, Fuller Brush began introducing other sales channels beyond door-to-door, including a mail-order catalog that sent out 10 million catalogs a year, and several outlet stores selling "slow-selling items, returned merchandise or slightly flawed goods"; by mid-1989, 35% of that year's estimated $160 million in sales came from catalogs, with another 5% coming from its stores.[9] Later that same year, a group of investors from Kansas headed by Lee Turner, a trial lawyer, took Fuller private; by 1991 the company now known as Fuller Industries and led by Stuart A. Ochiltree, had integrated its door-to-door and catalog business, with its 12,000 mostly part-time sales representatives receiving commissions for sales from either channel.[10]
CPAC subsidiary[edit]

In June 1994, Fuller, once again known as Fuller Brush Company, was acquired by CPAC Inc., a Leicester, New York-based manufacturer of photographic chemicals; CPAC took on the "heavy debt burden" accumulated while the company was private and whose annual sales, increasingly focused on chemicals, had shrunk to $24 million.[11]
In 2007, CPAC Inc. was acquired by Buckingham Capital Partners in a leveraged buyout.[1]
In February, 2012, Fuller Brush Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[12]
Victory Park Capital and David Sabin[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2012)


In December, 2012, Victory Park Capital and CEO, David Sabin, bought the iconic American company out of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The headquarters were moved from Great Bend, Kansas to Napa, California.[13]

The main factory for the Fuller Brush Company was located in East Hartford, Connecticut during the 1960s,[citation needed] where Fuller's son Avard ran the company. It had moved from Hartford on the other side of the Connecticut River some years earlier. The Research Division was there, led by Hank Whitman, along with the plastics molding operation.
The Industrial Division, under Verne Joy, was also at the East Hartford plant, where they made large motor-driven brushes for developing newspaper printing photo metal plates.[citation needed] All the mops were sewn at this plant. The perfuming operation was there also, including a large machine to detect what was in perfume made by other companies.[citation needed]
In front of the East Hartford plant was a large glass case with a stuffed large boar that represented the boar hair used in some of the original Fuller brushes.[citation needed]
Fuller had a "private label" division, Charter Products, that sold duplicate products under other brand names chosen by the distributor. Avard's interest in boating resulted in experiments at the plant with plastic molding of port lights (windows) for boats, including full plastic hardware.[citation needed]
New York[edit]
The plastic bottle and toothbrush manufacturing operation was in Philmont, New York.[citation needed] According to Fuller's memoir, Fuller Brush distributed the Bristlecomb, a hairbrush introduced by the Mohawk Company in 1928. In 1942, Fuller Brush bought out the Mohawk Brush Company and subsequently all the hairbrushes and industrial floor brushes were manufactured at the Mohawk Plant in Albany, New York.[14]
Great Bend, Kansas[edit]
Since 1973,[citation needed] Fuller brushes and over 2,000[citation needed] other Fuller products have been manufactured in Barton County, near Great Bend, Kansas.
Napa, California[edit]
Headquarters for this iconic brand were moved from Kansas to California shortly after being purchased by David Sabin and Victory Park Capital, while the manufacturing remains in Great Bend, KS.
Former employees[edit]
Former employees include evangelist Billy Graham, who became a Fuller Brush salesman during the summer after high school, and outsold "every other salesman in North Carolina";[15] in his 1997 autobiography, Just As I Am, Graham describes in some detail his experiences selling Fuller brushes door-to-door. Ellen Barkin was "born in the Bronx to a father who worked as a Fuller Brush man".[16] Clifford Irving "was a Fuller Brush man in Syracuse."[17]
More recently, Groundlings Theater veteran Paul Reubens, of Pee-wee Herman fame, worked as a Fuller Brush salesman while attending California Institute of the Arts.[18]
Other former employees include Frank Gross, photographer Tom Leutwiler, Dennis Quaid, Dick Clark, J. Bruce Llewellyn (co-founder of 100 Black Men of America), Ed Mirvish, Jack Sensenbrenner, Kin Shriner, and Ed Stelmach. Jack Nicholson and Felicia Farr were also featured in a few pictures in "The Fuller Magazine." Broadcaster Lowell Green admitted during his April 24, 2014 program to selling Fuller Brushes in Montreal's Westmount area during his college days in the 1950s.
In popular culture[edit]

The Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as a Jewish Fuller Brush salesman in Disney's 1933 Academy Award-winning Silly Symphonies version of Three Little Pigs.
In Warner Brothers's 1944 cartoon "Duck Soup to Nuts," Daffy Duck induces Porky Pig to open the window of his diving helmet by knocking on it and declaring, "It's The Fuller Brush Man!"
The company also inspired two comedy films, The Fuller Brush Man, a 1948 movie starring Red Skelton and Janet Blair, and The Fuller Brush Girl, a 1950 movie starring Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert.
The Fuller Brush salesman is mentioned by rock and roots artist James McMurtry in the song Fuller Brush Man. The song appears on his 1995 release, Where'd You Hide The Body, released by Columbia Records.
The 1972 song by John Prine, "The Frying Pan," from his album Diamonds in the Rough, begins with the line, "I came home from work this evening, there was a note in the frying pan, it said cook your own supper babe, I've run off with the Fuller Brush Man."
A line in the song "Sneakin' Around" from the 1982 movie The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas mentions "dirty jokes about the Fuller brush man."
In the 1987 episode "Much Ad About Scrooge" of Disney's DuckTales, Uncle Scrooge is fast-talked into letting a Fuller Brush salesman into his house.
In Donnie Brasco (film), Maggie Pistone (impersonated by Anne Heche) quips to her visiting husband Joe (who was using the alias Donald Brasco at the time described in the film and was impersonated in the film by Johnny Depp) that their two daughters might not recognize him due to his infrequent presence at home, "They might think you're the Fuller brush man."
In the 2008 film Billy: The Early Years, famed evangelist Billy Graham, impersonated in the film by Armie Hammer, has a summer job in his college years as a door-to-door Fuller brush salesman. (Graham's autobiography Just As I Am refers to exactly this activity on his part, as mentioned above.)
Often referred to as San Francisco’s last door-to-door salesman, as of 2013, Norman Hall continues to sell Fuller Brush products in the Bay Area and was interviewed on Radio Sausalito.[19]
In August 2013, the company was featured on the AMC reality series "The Pitch" where a group of advertising agencies compete to pitch advertising campaigns to Sabin and his team at Fuller Brush. The Monogram Group won the account with the slogan 'live fuller.' [13]
