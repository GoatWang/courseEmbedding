               The NBER (www.nber.org) is the nation's leading nonprofit economic research organization. Sixteen of the 31 American Nobel Peace winners in Economics and six of the past Chairmen of the President's Council of Economic Advisers have been researchers at the NBER. The more than 600 professors of economics and business now teaching at universities around the country who are NBER researchers are the leading scholars in their fields. These Bureau associates concentrate on four types of empirical research: developing new statistical measurements, estimating quantitative models of economic behavior, assessing the effects of public policies on the U.S. economy, and projecting the effects of alternative policy proposals.
Title: Board Member
               Company: Center for Global Development
Job Details
               CGD was founded in November 2001 by Edward Scott Jr., C. Fred Bergsten, and Nancy Birdsall. A technology entrepreneur, philanthropist, and former senior US government official, Ed Scott provided the vision and a significant financial commitment that made the creation of the Center possible. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lent his formidable reputation in academic and policy circles and provided the fledgling Center with a roof and logistical support within the Peterson Institute for the Center's initial months of operation. Nancy Birdsall, a former head of the World Bank research department and executive vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank, became CGD's first president. Her intellectual leadership and rare combination of being both hard-headed and soft-hearted about development attracted a cadre of researchers and other professionals who are deeply dedicated to CGD's mission. CGD's three founders perceived a growing need for independent research to generate practical, creative solutions to the challenges that global interdependence poses to the developing countries, starting with debt. Delivering on Debt Relief: From IMF Gold to a New Aid Architecture (CGD, 2004), by Birdsall and John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, was the Center's first book. CGD moved to its current location in 2014. Previously we lived on Massachusetts Avenue, Washington's 'think tank row'. In 2011 we established CGD Europe, based in London, to help bring CGD's unique blend of evidence-led, practical research to policy, development, research and finance communities in Europe.

Jessica P. Einhorn Named Dean of JHU SAIS






 




 





Jessica P. Einhorn, a former managing director of the World Bank, has been appointed dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of The Johns Hopkins University.
Einhorn, who earned a master's degree in international affairs from SAIS in 1970, will be the first graduate of the 59-year-old school to return as dean. She succeeds Paul Wolfowitz, who resigned in 02/2001 to become deputy secretary of defense in the Bush administration. She begins work at Johns Hopkins 06/1.
"I had a terrific educational and personal experience as a student at SAIS from 1968 to 1970," Einhorn said. "I am excited and honored to have the chance to return as dean at this time of great international challenge to the United States."
Einhorn worked for 19 years at the World Bank, which lends money to developing countries and provides assistance designed to raise living standards, assist the world's poorest populations and eliminate the worst effects of poverty. Einhorn rose through a number of positions at the bank to become vice president and treasurer in 1992. In 1996, she was promoted to managing director, serving directly under World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn. In that position, she was credited with creating a strong team and governance structure, and helping to modernize the bank's financial policies, loan products and systems.
Einhorn is known internationally for her influence on the development of modern global capital markets, including key roles in the first currency swap operation, in the development of the global bond and in risk management of derivatives. She spent her last year at the World Bank, from 1998 to 1999, as a visiting fellow at the International Monetary Fund, studying issues involving the international financial system, including the nature of financial crises.
"Jessica has both a strong academic perspective on public policy and a profound practical grasp of international finance, a combination particularly relevant to SAIS's mission and its unique strengths," said William R. Brody, president of Johns Hopkins. "She brings a broad range of skills, experience and contacts, both domestic and international, that will serve her well as she seeks to build on the success that SAIS enjoyed under Paul Wolfowitz."
Since she left the World Bank, Einhorn has worked in the Washington office of Clark & Weinstock, a consulting firm. She is also a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and a director of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Institute for International Economics and the Center for Global Development. She is a former trustee of the German Marshall Fund. She is a director of Pitney Bowes Inc. and Bankers Trust and chairs the International Advisory Board of J.E. Robert Cos.
Earlier in her career, she worked at the U.S. Treasury and State departments and in the International Development Cooperation Agency of the United States.
In addition to her SAIS degree, she earned a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1967 and a doctorate in politics from Princeton University in 1974. Her dissertation was published as a book, Expropriation Politics.
SAIS is one of the country's leading graduate schools devoted to the study of international relations. Located along Embassy Row in Washington's Dupont Circle area, the school enrolls approximately 450 full-time graduate students and mid-career professionals and has trained more than 10,000 alumni in all aspects of international affairs.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
