            Energy Intelligence Software for Businesses    

You know how challenging it can be to find a product that addresses your whole energy spend, not just a single aspect of it. Too many partial solutions become a nightmare to manage, important details get lost, and savings opportunities fall between the cracks.
You need a single platform powerful enough to manage your energy spend holistically.
Our software reveals your business's energy usage from every angle, highlighting inefficiencies, simplifying reporting and cross-team communications, and securing you the best price on energy.

            Demand Response    

EnerNOC helps businesses earn money through participation in demand response and helps utilities build clean, reliable demand response networks. For businesses, EnerNOC pays you for reducing energy consumption a few times per year—money that your facilities can use to reinvest back into your business or other energy projects. Our experts help your building operators develop and execute an energy reduction plan, and you watch the payments roll in. For utilities, EnerNOC builds the biggest, most reliable demand response networks in the world.

EnerNOC Introduces New Utility Demand Response Product
EnerNOC Demand Manager(TM) Increases Addressable Market

SAN ANTONIO and BOSTON, Jan. 29, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today at DistribuTECH, EnerNOC, Inc. (Nasdaq:ENOC), a leading provider of energy intelligence software (EIS), announced that it has expanded its demand response offerings for electric utilities and retail energy suppliers. The company introduced EnerNOC Demand ManagerTM, software-as-a-service (SaaS) that provides utilities and retailers with the tools to manage their demand 
response programs and leverages EnerNOC's industry-leading technology for commercial and industrial (C&I) demand response. This new offering also includes a data integration API that allows EnerNOC's energy intelligence software to integrate with utility interval data collected from existing utility meters, which will allow utilities to leverage their investments in AMI/smart meter infrastructure and deliver additional value to their C&I customer base.


 "This expansion enables a broader range of utility customers to benefit from EnerNOC's energy intelligence software and solutions," said Tim Healy, Chairman and CEO of EnerNOC. "We can now provide utilities and retailers EnerNOC Demand ManagerTM if they prefer to buy software and professional services for demand response program management over traditional capacity-based resource procurement."

EnerNOC now offers the following two demand response products to utilities and retailers:


EnerNOC Demand ResourceTM, a capacity-based agreement that provides utilities an assured level of load reduction delivered by EnerNOC on a turnkey, fully outsourced basis; and

EnerNOC Demand ManagerTM, software-as-a-service that provides utilities with tools to manage their demand response programs, including real-time load monitoring, dispatching applications, customizable reports, measurement and verification applications, and numerous professional services.



 EnerNOC Demand ManagerTM allows utilities and retailers to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of their internally managed demand response programs by leveraging EnerNOC's DemandSMART™ cloud-based demand response software, OpenADR 2.0B-certified real-time metering and controls, and secure network operations infrastructure. Utilities and retailers can now purchase EnerNOC's integrated software and hardware as a stand-alone package or in combination with customized customer engagement and professional services, including program marketing support, participant 
recruitment, field engineering services, and portfolio management, among others.


 Several EnerNOC utility customers have already adopted and begun implementing EnerNOC Demand ManagerTM, including Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company (LG&E and KU) and ERM Power in Eastern Australia.


 "We needed to provide our medium and large commercial customers with an effective way to partner with us to help manage future energy costs," said David Huff, Director of Customer Energy Efficiency and Smart Meter Strategy, LG&E and KU. "Through our partnership with EnerNOC, we were able to quickly and effectively engage our commercial customers in a successful tariff-based program, proving that demand response can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. We managed our customer incentive payments directly, while EnerNOC supported our program with recruitment, site enablement, and dispatch and monitoring software."


 EnerNOC Demand ManagerTM is ideal for utilities with existing tariff-based demand response programs, those with fully automated demand response (AutoDR), as well as smaller-scale programs or those deployed by competitive retailers in which utilities prefer to contract directly with their customers for load reduction.


 To learn more about EnerNOC's demand response technology offerings for utilities, visit EnerNOC's booth #619 at DistribuTECH. DistribuTECH is the premier annual conference for power industry professionals, focusing on energy distribution infrastructure and related topics.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
EnerNOC was first established by Timothy G. Healy and David Brewster, as EnerNOC, LLC in New Hampshire from December 2001 until June 2003. On June 5, 2003 EnerNOC was incorporated in Delaware. Today their corporate headquarters is at One Marina Park Drive, Suite 400, Boston, Massachusetts 02210.
Initial Public Offering[edit]
EnerNOC went public in 2007 on the NASDAQ stock exchange at US$26 per share followed by a rally to US$50 per share in spite of reporting two consecutive annual losses. EnerNOC provided the strongest IPO by percentage increase in the green energy sector for the year. The offering included 3.75 million shares. US$98 million was raised with underwriters Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.[3][4]
Expansion[edit]
EnerNOC owns numerous subsidiaries around the world. In 2009, EnerNOC bought Cogent Energy and acquired eQuilibrium Solutions, which provides carbon accounting solutions.[5] In March, 2010, EnerNOC bought SmallFoot, LLC, a company that makes wireless systems to manage demand for smaller facilities. Tim Healy, CEO of EnerNOC, said of the acquisition, "Going deeper into this underserved market represents a large growth opportunity for our company. SmallFoot gives us additional technology to unlock all forms of demand response and deploy our full suite of applications in this exciting market."[6]
In late 2010 and early 2011, respectively, EnerNOC announced agreements to acquire Global Energy Partners and M2M Communications. Global Energy Partners is "an industry leader in designing and implementing utility energy efficiency and demand response programs."[7] M2M Communications specializes in wireless technology solutions for energy management and demand response.
Since early 2014, EnerNOC has acquired five additional companies: Activation Energy, an Irish provider of demand response; Entelios, a German demand response provider; EnTech, a global utility bill management software provider; Pulse Energy, a Vancouver-based provider of utility customer engagement software; and World Energy, an energy procurement software company.
Products[edit]
As of March 31, 2015, EnerNOC had over 70,000 sites using its services and software, including commercial buildings, supermarkets, industrial sites, and universities.[8] EIS for enterprise includes budgeting and procurement, utility bill management, facility optimization, visibility and reporting, project tracking, demand management, and demand response. EnerNOC's EIS solutions for utilities help maximize customer engagement and the value of demand-side resources, including demand response and energy efficiency.
EnerNOC is the world's leading provider of demand response. If a utility company or grid operator has a sudden increase in demand, EnerNOC communicates with customers connected to its network in order to reduce energy use. This can restore balance to the system and prevent the need for the utility to purchase more expensive electricity or even avoid blackouts or brownouts in some cases. During a demand response dispatch, a participating site might switch over to a generator, reduce air conditioning or lighting usage, or power down appliances or other equipment that are not being used. If a site reduces its energy usage during these dispatches, the utility company or grid operator will pay EnerNOC and the customer for this service. Customers are also paid for being on call to reduce demand, thereby providing a superficial, but accountable, capacity to the grid operator or utility. EnerNOC offers a web-based demand response software application that enables its customers to track their own individual energy reductions.[9]
Structure[edit]
Corporate Officers[edit]
Timothy G. Healy[edit]
Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman since its founding of Enernoc, Inc. He has previously worked for Northern Power Systems, Inc., Merrill Lynch as a Financial Analyst, International Fuel Cells (now UTC Fuel Cells), Commonwealth Capital Ventures, Contemporary Investment Management as a Senior Associate, and worked as Analyst of Commonwealth Capital Ventures, Commonwealth Capital Ventures III, L.P. and Commonwealth Capital Ventures IV, L.P. He also co-founded and served as an Associate for the public company Student Advantage. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Government and Economics from Dartmouth College and a Master of Business Administration from the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth.[10]

Notable work[edit]
EnerNOC received a $10 million contract in 2010 to track how much energy state-owned facilities use in Massachusetts. The contract is funded with stimulus money through the United States Department of Energy. Massachusetts hopes to use the study to shave 5 to 15 percent of its annual energy expenses, as well as help shift to alternative energy sources. EnerNOC will be receiving metering information from 470 state-owned buildings, including schools, prisons, and municipal buildings. The information received will include how much energy is being used and where the energy is coming from (for example natural gas, oil, or renewable energy sources).[12] In the summer of 2010, EnerNOC contracted with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public power company, for a 10-year, 560 megawatt demand response contract that represented an addition of 400 MW to TVA’s existing deployment of approximately 160 MW with EnerNOC.[13]
Awards and recognition[edit]
EnerNOC, which stands for Energy Network Operations Center, has won numerous awards for its technology, customer service, and industry.[14] Some of these awards include two 2009 Smart Grid Product of the Year Awards from the Technology Marketing Corporation and Intelligent Communications Partners. EnerNOC’s Boston Business Journal also honored EnerNOC’s EfficiencySMART Insight with a 2011 Best Green Practices Award in the Invention category.[15]
EnerNOC was also named one of the Boston Globe's Top 100 Places to Work in 2009[16] and 2010,[17] as well as one of the Boston Business Journal's Best Places to Work in 2008.[18]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
EnerNOC was first established by Timothy G. Healy and David Brewster, as EnerNOC, LLC in New Hampshire from December 2001 until June 2003. On June 5, 2003 EnerNOC was incorporated in Delaware. Today their corporate headquarters is at One Marina Park Drive, Suite 400, Boston, Massachusetts 02210.
Initial Public Offering[edit]
EnerNOC went public in 2007 on the NASDAQ stock exchange at US$26 per share followed by a rally to US$50 per share in spite of reporting two consecutive annual losses. EnerNOC provided the strongest IPO by percentage increase in the green energy sector for the year. The offering included 3.75 million shares. US$98 million was raised with underwriters Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.[3][4]
Expansion[edit]
EnerNOC owns numerous subsidiaries around the world. In 2009, EnerNOC bought Cogent Energy and acquired eQuilibrium Solutions, which provides carbon accounting solutions.[5] In March, 2010, EnerNOC bought SmallFoot, LLC, a company that makes wireless systems to manage demand for smaller facilities. Tim Healy, CEO of EnerNOC, said of the acquisition, "Going deeper into this underserved market represents a large growth opportunity for our company. SmallFoot gives us additional technology to unlock all forms of demand response and deploy our full suite of applications in this exciting market."[6]
In late 2010 and early 2011, respectively, EnerNOC announced agreements to acquire Global Energy Partners and M2M Communications. Global Energy Partners is "an industry leader in designing and implementing utility energy efficiency and demand response programs."[7] M2M Communications specializes in wireless technology solutions for energy management and demand response.
Since early 2014, EnerNOC has acquired five additional companies: Activation Energy, an Irish provider of demand response; Entelios, a German demand response provider; EnTech, a global utility bill management software provider; Pulse Energy, a Vancouver-based provider of utility customer engagement software; and World Energy, an energy procurement software company.
Products[edit]
As of March 31, 2015, EnerNOC had over 70,000 sites using its services and software, including commercial buildings, supermarkets, industrial sites, and universities.[8] EIS for enterprise includes budgeting and procurement, utility bill management, facility optimization, visibility and reporting, project tracking, demand management, and demand response. EnerNOC's EIS solutions for utilities help maximize customer engagement and the value of demand-side resources, including demand response and energy efficiency.
EnerNOC is the world's leading provider of demand response. If a utility company or grid operator has a sudden increase in demand, EnerNOC communicates with customers connected to its network in order to reduce energy use. This can restore balance to the system and prevent the need for the utility to purchase more expensive electricity or even avoid blackouts or brownouts in some cases. During a demand response dispatch, a participating site might switch over to a generator, reduce air conditioning or lighting usage, or power down appliances or other equipment that are not being used. If a site reduces its energy usage during these dispatches, the utility company or grid operator will pay EnerNOC and the customer for this service. Customers are also paid for being on call to reduce demand, thereby providing a superficial, but accountable, capacity to the grid operator or utility. EnerNOC offers a web-based demand response software application that enables its customers to track their own individual energy reductions.[9]

Notable work[edit]
EnerNOC received a $10 million contract in 2010 to track how much energy state-owned facilities use in Massachusetts. The contract is funded with stimulus money through the United States Department of Energy. Massachusetts hopes to use the study to shave 5 to 15 percent of its annual energy expenses, as well as help shift to alternative energy sources. EnerNOC will be receiving metering information from 470 state-owned buildings, including schools, prisons, and municipal buildings. The information received will include how much energy is being used and where the energy is coming from (for example natural gas, oil, or renewable energy sources).[12] In the summer of 2010, EnerNOC contracted with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public power company, for a 10-year, 560 megawatt demand response contract that represented an addition of 400 MW to TVA’s existing deployment of approximately 160 MW with EnerNOC.[13]
Awards and recognition[edit]
EnerNOC, which stands for Energy Network Operations Center, has won numerous awards for its technology, customer service, and industry.[14] Some of these awards include two 2009 Smart Grid Product of the Year Awards from the Technology Marketing Corporation and Intelligent Communications Partners. EnerNOC’s Boston Business Journal also honored EnerNOC’s EfficiencySMART Insight with a 2011 Best Green Practices Award in the Invention category.[15]
EnerNOC was also named one of the Boston Globe's Top 100 Places to Work in 2009[16] and 2010,[17] as well as one of the Boston Business Journal's Best Places to Work in 2008.[18]

SmallFoot gives us additional technology to unlock all forms of demand response and deploy our full suite of applications in this exciting market."[6]
In late 2010 and early 2011, respectively, EnerNOC announced agreements to acquire Global Energy Partners and M2M Communications. Global Energy Partners is "an industry leader in designing and implementing utility energy efficiency and demand response programs."[7] M2M Communications specializes in wireless technology solutions for energy management and demand response.
Since early 2014, EnerNOC has acquired five additional companies: Activation Energy, an Irish provider of demand response; Entelios, a German demand response provider; EnTech, a global utility bill management software provider; Pulse Energy, a Vancouver-based provider of utility customer engagement software; and World Energy, an energy procurement software company.
Products[edit]
As of March 31, 2015, EnerNOC had over 70,000 sites using its services and software, including commercial buildings, supermarkets, industrial sites, and universities.[8] EIS for enterprise includes budgeting and procurement, utility bill management, facility optimization, visibility and reporting, project tracking, demand management, and demand response. EnerNOC's EIS solutions for utilities help maximize customer engagement and the value of demand-side resources, including demand response and energy efficiency.
EnerNOC is the world's leading provider of demand response. If a utility company or grid operator has a sudden increase in demand, EnerNOC communicates with customers connected to its network in order to reduce energy use. This can restore balance to the system and prevent the need for the utility to purchase more expensive electricity or even avoid blackouts or brownouts in some cases. During a demand response dispatch, a participating site might switch over to a generator, reduce air conditioning or lighting usage, or power down appliances or other equipment that are not being used. If a site reduces its energy usage during these dispatches, the utility company or grid operator will pay EnerNOC and the customer for this service. Customers are also paid for being on call to reduce demand, thereby providing a superficial, but accountable, capacity to the grid operator or utility. EnerNOC offers a web-based demand response software application that enables its customers to track their own individual energy reductions.[9]

Notable work[edit]
EnerNOC received a $10 million contract in 2010 to track how much energy state-owned facilities use in Massachusetts. The contract is funded with stimulus money through the United States Department of Energy. Massachusetts hopes to use the study to shave 5 to 15 percent of its annual energy expenses, as well as help shift to alternative energy sources. EnerNOC will be receiving metering information from 470 state-owned buildings, including schools, prisons, and municipal buildings. The information received will include how much energy is being used and where the energy is coming from (for example natural gas, oil, or renewable energy sources).[12] In the summer of 2010, EnerNOC contracted with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public power company, for a 10-year, 560 megawatt demand response contract that represented an addition of 400 MW to TVA’s existing deployment of approximately 160 MW with EnerNOC.[13]
Awards and recognition[edit]
EnerNOC, which stands for Energy Network Operations Center, has won numerous awards for its technology, customer service, and industry.[14] Some of these awards include two 2009 Smart Grid Product of the Year Awards from the Technology Marketing Corporation and Intelligent Communications Partners. EnerNOC’s Boston Business Journal also honored EnerNOC’s EfficiencySMART Insight with a 2011 Best Green Practices Award in the Invention category.[15]
EnerNOC was also named one of the Boston Globe's Top 100 Places to Work in 2009[16] and 2010,[17] as well as one of the Boston Business Journal's Best Places to Work in 2008.[18]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
EnerNOC was first established by Timothy G. Healy and David Brewster, as EnerNOC, LLC in New Hampshire from December 2001 until June 2003. On June 5, 2003 EnerNOC was incorporated in Delaware. Today their corporate headquarters is at One Marina Park Drive, Suite 400, Boston, Massachusetts 02210.
Initial Public Offering[edit]
EnerNOC went public in 2007 on the NASDAQ stock exchange at US$26 per share followed by a rally to US$50 per share in spite of reporting two consecutive annual losses. EnerNOC provided the strongest IPO by percentage increase in the green energy sector for the year. The offering included 3.75 million shares. US$98 million was raised with underwriters Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.[3][4]
Expansion[edit]
EnerNOC owns numerous subsidiaries around the world. In 2009, EnerNOC bought Cogent Energy and acquired eQuilibrium Solutions, which provides carbon accounting solutions.[5] In March, 2010, EnerNOC bought SmallFoot, LLC, a company that makes wireless systems to manage demand for smaller facilities.

Notable work[edit]
EnerNOC received a $10 million contract in 2010 to track how much energy state-owned facilities use in Massachusetts. The contract is funded with stimulus money through the United States Department of Energy. Massachusetts hopes to use the study to shave 5 to 15 percent of its annual energy expenses, as well as help shift to alternative energy sources. EnerNOC will be receiving metering information from 470 state-owned buildings, including schools, prisons, and municipal buildings. The information received will include how much energy is being used and where the energy is coming from (for example natural gas, oil, or renewable energy sources).[12] In the summer of 2010, EnerNOC contracted with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public power company, for a 10-year, 560 megawatt demand response contract that represented an addition of 400 MW to TVA’s existing deployment of approximately 160 MW with EnerNOC.[13]
Awards and recognition[edit]
EnerNOC, which stands for Energy Network Operations Center, has won numerous awards for its technology, customer service, and industry.[14] Some of these awards include two 2009 Smart Grid Product of the Year Awards from the Technology Marketing Corporation and Intelligent Communications Partners. EnerNOC’s Boston Business Journal also honored EnerNOC’s EfficiencySMART Insight with a 2011 Best Green Practices Award in the Invention category.[15]
EnerNOC was also named one of the Boston Globe's Top 100 Places to Work in 2009[16] and 2010,[17] as well as one of the Boston Business Journal's Best Places to Work in 2008.[18]

 EnerNOC, Inc. - Energy Manager Today                     Skip to content&n=abab4b2c’ border=’0′ alt=” />        EnerNOC, Inc. https://www.enernoc.com/ Procurement“A nice merger of solutions that can do a lot to support the energy industry. The integration of the dashboards with live auctions brings a new level of visibility to the customer.” –Energy Manager Today Awards judgeEnerNOC provides businesses with reliable energy procurement decision-making software and support, including load and financial analyses, market trend monitoring, supplier negotiation, risk assessment, and strategic advice. With a blend of expert professional services and cutting-edge software capabilities, EnerNOC’s procurement provides the market visibility and strategic management necessary to ensure businesses secure power contracts with the lowest rates and most favorable terms, the company says. Options to procure renewable energy or other distributed energy resources (DER) are also available, enabling businesses to increase their portfolio share of clean energy and meet their broader sustainability goals.When an organization decides to pursue an auction, EnerNOC’s procurement experts run analytics to get an understanding of their energy and financial needs based on year-round operations, then create electronic RFPs to solicit to the suppliers in the organization’s market.One particularly innovative aspect of EnerNOC’s procurement product is its real-time reverse energy auction platform, the company says. By compelling suppliers to compete fiercely for the purchaser’s business, the platform obtains prices from hundreds of suppliers in a matter of minutes, ensuring purchasers get the best possible price on energy.A prime example is a New Jersey hotel owner who earned six-figure savings for a portfolio of just 3 properties. With the electricity contracts at these properties soon expiring, the purchaser turned to EnerNOC to collect energy usage data for each hotel, develop and market electronic RFPs to the supplier community, and run a series of online reverse auctions to create a hyper-competitive marketplace where suppliers shed margin to win business. As a result, 135 bids were placed by 14 suppliers over the course of one hour and six auctions, yielding more than $370,000 in energy-rate savings over a 24-month term.“The system can work to a great benefit to industry,” said one judge.
