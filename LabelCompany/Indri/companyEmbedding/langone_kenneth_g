Early life[edit]
Kenneth Langone was born in Roslyn Heights, New York, to Italian American working-class parents. His father was a plumber and his mother a cafeteria worker. As a student at Bucknell University, Langone worked various jobs: a butcher's assistant, a caddy and a ditch digger. While at Bucknell, Langone became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. After graduating in three and a half years, Langone headed back to New York, this time to Manhattan instead of Roslyn Heights. There he attended New York University Stern School of Business at night while working full-time during the day. That part-time evening program now bears his name, and is known as the "Langone Program" at NYU.
Business career[edit]
In the early 1960s, Langone began his career at a Wall Street financial services company named R.W. Pressprich. He soon became a “mover and shaker” [3] in the firm, and a major factor in the development of new business. In 1968 Langone met and wooed Ross Perot into letting Pressprich handle Electronic Data Systems's IPO. In 1969, Langone would be named Pressprich’s president.
In 1974, Langone left to form a new firm, named Invemed – a venture capital firm that would become hugely successful.[3] Langone began to study the home improvement business and eventually bought stock in Handy Dan, a home improvement chain. This led to a relationship with Handy Dan CEO Bernard Marcus and CFO Arthur Blank. Although a minority shareholder, Langone effectively protected Marcus from issues that arose between Marcus and Sanford Sigiloff, the CEO of The Daylin Corporation, Handy Dan's parent company. Marcus, however, felt that if Langone sold his interest in Handy Dan, it might actually improve his relationship with Sigiloff. Shortly after Langone sold his Handy Dan stock both Marcus and Blank were fired. Langone organized financing for Marcus and Blank to found Home Depot. Now a national chain with over 300,000 employees, it is Langone's most notable business venture.
Other endeavors[edit]
Langone has attracted publicity with his attempted purchase of the New York Stock Exchange. Although the deal fell through, it raised Langone's stature on Wall Street and in the business community in general. He was a codefendant with Richard Grasso in the 2004 prosecution by Eliot Spitzer over a controversial package of $139.5m of benefits received by Grasso on leaving his post as chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, in addition to an estimated $10m annual pay.[4] The Exchange was operated as a non-profit enterprise, and so was subject to New York state laws governing remuneration within non-profit enterprises. Langone was, as a director of the Exchange and senior member of the remuneration committee, heavily involved in development of the pay package. On July 1, 2008, the New York State Court of Appeals dismissed the case. The majority opinion stated that, since the beginning of the case, the NYSE had become a subsidiary of a for-profit multinational corporation, and that pursuing the company in the matter was therefore "not in the public interest."
He was elected as director of Yum! Brands effective October 7, 1997, and is a member of the Audit Committee.
On July 8, 2010, Geeknet announced that Kenneth Langone was elected Chairman of its Board of Directors[5] and is now serving as CEO.
Langone served on the board of General Electric in 2001.
Langone tapped Robert Nardelli to become CEO of Home Depot after Jeffrey R. Immelt was chosen over both Nardelli and James McNerney to succeed Jack Welch as CEO of GE.
Langone also served on the board of Database Technologies, a position he filled at invitation of the company's founder Hank Asher.[6] Asher claims Langone was responsible for his ouster.
Langone was a cofounder and board member of ChoicePoint Inc.
The Wall Street Journal discussed a pitch made by Bernard Madoff to Langone just before Thanksgiving 2008. Langone told the newspaper that Madoff said he was raising $500 million to $1 billion for his new fund for exclusive clients.[7]
Langone is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[8]
Personal life[edit]
He and his wife Elaine Langone have three children; Kenneth G. Jr., Stephen, and Bruce Langone.
He is a practicing Roman Catholic, and was made a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Benedict XVI.
He has expressed his lack of opposition to same-sex marriage, saying "If two boys, two girls want to get married, it doesn't bother me... it's none of my business."[9]
He lives in Sands Point, New York.
Philanthropy[edit]
Langone has donated millions of dollars to various charities. His philanthropic focus has been universities, medical research and training, education, and helping children.[10]
Universities Langone has contributed towards include Bucknell University, and NYU. Bucknell University has benefited from his $11 million donation, which financed a new Athletics and Recreation Center. Additionally, he has donated $6.5 million to NYU's Stern School to endow the Kenneth G. Langone Part-time Evening MBA program. In 2008, Kenneth and Elaine Langone made an unrestricted $200 million gift—the largest in the Medical Center's history—and the NYU Medical Center was subsequently renamed the NYU Elaine A. and Kenneth G. Langone Medical Center. Langone serves as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the NYU Langone Medical Center.[10][11]
Langone has contributed towards charities which fund medical research and treatment and provide education and services to the disadvantaged. These charities have included the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, The Children's Oncology Society (Ronald McDonald House), Tomorrow's Hope Foundation, Harlem Children's Zone, and the Robin Hood Foundation, where he serves as Director. Langone is also the Chairman of the Promise Academy, a charter school in New York City.
He serves on the boards of The Ronald McDonald House of NY CSIS, The Medal of Honor Foundation, and the Harlem Children's Zone.[10][11][12][13]
Through Home Depot, Kenneth Langone started the charitable organization Ken's Kids, which provides job training and employment to youths aged 18–21 with disabilities in Philadelphia. Langone himself financially contributes to the charity.[10]
In Popular Media[edit]
Langone is portrayed by actor Ray Iannicelli in the 2017 HBO Films production The Wizard of Lies. In the film, Langone is depicted as one of the few people who sees through the schemes of convicted Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff. In a scene featuring Iannicelli and Robert DeNiro as Madoff, Langone forcefully rejects an offer to invest money into a new investment fund that later turns out to be fraudulent.

Early life[edit]
Kenneth Langone was born in Roslyn Heights, New York, to Italian American working-class parents. His father was a plumber and his mother a cafeteria worker. As a student at Bucknell University, Langone worked various jobs: a butcher's assistant, a caddy and a ditch digger. While at Bucknell, Langone became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. After graduating in three and a half years, Langone headed back to New York, this time to Manhattan instead of Roslyn Heights. There he attended New York University Stern School of Business at night while working full-time during the day. That part-time evening program now bears his name, and is known as the "Langone Program" at NYU.
Business career[edit]
In the early 1960s, Langone began his career at a Wall Street financial services company named R.W. Pressprich. He soon became a “mover and shaker” [3] in the firm, and a major factor in the development of new business. In 1968 Langone met and wooed Ross Perot into letting Pressprich handle Electronic Data Systems's IPO. In 1969, Langone would be named Pressprich’s president.
In 1974, Langone left to form a new firm, named Invemed – a venture capital firm that would become hugely successful.[3] Langone began to study the home improvement business and eventually bought stock in Handy Dan, a home improvement chain. This led to a relationship with Handy Dan CEO Bernard Marcus and CFO Arthur Blank. Although a minority shareholder, Langone effectively protected Marcus from issues that arose between Marcus and Sanford Sigiloff, the CEO of The Daylin Corporation, Handy Dan's parent company. Marcus, however, felt that if Langone sold his interest in Handy Dan, it might actually improve his relationship with Sigiloff. Shortly after Langone sold his Handy Dan stock both Marcus and Blank were fired. Langone organized financing for Marcus and Blank to found Home Depot. Now a national chain with over 300,000 employees, it is Langone's most notable business venture.
Other endeavors[edit]
Langone has attracted publicity with his attempted purchase of the New York Stock Exchange. Although the deal fell through, it raised Langone's stature on Wall Street and in the business community in general. He was a codefendant with Richard Grasso in the 2004 prosecution by Eliot Spitzer over a controversial package of $139.5m of benefits received by Grasso on leaving his post as chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, in addition to an estimated $10m annual pay.[4] The Exchange was operated as a non-profit enterprise, and so was subject to New York state laws governing remuneration within non-profit enterprises. Langone was, as a director of the Exchange and senior member of the remuneration committee, heavily involved in development of the pay package. On July 1, 2008, the New York State Court of Appeals dismissed the case. The majority opinion stated that, since the beginning of the case, the NYSE had become a subsidiary of a for-profit multinational corporation, and that pursuing the company in the matter was therefore "not in the public interest."
He was elected as director of Yum! Brands effective October 7, 1997, and is a member of the Audit Committee.
On July 8, 2010, Geeknet announced that Kenneth Langone was elected Chairman of its Board of Directors[5] and is now serving as CEO.
Langone served on the board of General Electric in 2001.
Langone tapped Robert Nardelli to become CEO of Home Depot after Jeffrey R. Immelt was chosen over both Nardelli and James McNerney to succeed Jack Welch as CEO of GE.
Langone also served on the board of Database Technologies, a position he filled at invitation of the company's founder Hank Asher.[6] Asher claims Langone was responsible for his ouster.
Langone was a cofounder and board member of ChoicePoint Inc.
The Wall Street Journal discussed a pitch made by Bernard Madoff to Langone just before Thanksgiving 2008. Langone told the newspaper that Madoff said he was raising $500 million to $1 billion for his new fund for exclusive clients.[7]
Langone is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[8]
Personal life[edit]
He and his wife Elaine Langone have three children; Kenneth G. Jr., Stephen, and Bruce Langone.
He is a practicing Roman Catholic, and was made a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Benedict XVI.
He has expressed his lack of opposition to same-sex marriage, saying "If two boys, two girls want to get married, it doesn't bother me... it's none of my business."[9]
He lives in Sands Point, New York.
Philanthropy[edit]
Langone has donated millions of dollars to various charities. His philanthropic focus has been universities, medical research and training, education, and helping children.[10]
Universities Langone has contributed towards include Bucknell University, and NYU. Bucknell University has benefited from his $11 million donation, which financed a new Athletics and Recreation Center. Additionally, he has donated $6.5 million to NYU's Stern School to endow the Kenneth G. Langone Part-time Evening MBA program. In 2008, Kenneth and Elaine Langone made an unrestricted $200 million gift—the largest in the Medical Center's history—and the NYU Medical Center was subsequently renamed the NYU Elaine A. and Kenneth G. Langone Medical Center. Langone serves as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the NYU Langone Medical Center.[10][11]
Langone has contributed towards charities which fund medical research and treatment and provide education and services to the disadvantaged. These charities have included the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, The Children's Oncology Society (Ronald McDonald House), Tomorrow's Hope Foundation, Harlem Children's Zone, and the Robin Hood Foundation, where he serves as Director. Langone is also the Chairman of the Promise Academy, a charter school in New York City.
He serves on the boards of The Ronald McDonald House of NY CSIS, The Medal of Honor Foundation, and the Harlem Children's Zone.[10][11][12][13]
Through Home Depot, Kenneth Langone started the charitable organization Ken's Kids, which provides job training and employment to youths aged 18–21 with disabilities in Philadelphia. Langone himself financially contributes to the charity.[10]
In Popular Media[edit]
Langone is portrayed by actor Ray Iannicelli in the 2017 HBO Films production The Wizard of Lies. In the film, Langone is depicted as one of the few people who sees through the schemes of convicted Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff. In a scene featuring Iannicelli and Robert DeNiro as Madoff, Langone forcefully rejects an offer to invest money into a new investment fund that later turns out to be fraudulent.

Langone is portrayed by actor Ray Iannicelli in the 2017 HBO Films production The Wizard of Lies. In the film, Langone is depicted as one of the few people who sees through the schemes of convicted Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff. In a scene featuring Iannicelli and Robert DeNiro as Madoff, Langone forcefully rejects an offer to invest money into a new investment fund that later turns out to be fraudulent.

N.Y.U. Medical Center Gets Another $100 Million Gift

Kenneth G. Langone, a billionaire financier and a founder of Home Depot, is giving another  $100 million donation to New York University Medical Center, matching the one that he made anonymously in 1999.In return, the university plans to name the medical center the N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center, effective Wednesday.The university says that it will use the $200 million from Mr. Langone and his wife, Elaine A. Langone, to start a campaign to raise $1 billion for a new hospital pavilion. The university says it has already raised $50 million for the project.It has also hired the team of Polshek Partnership Architects/NBBJ to design the pavilion and create a master plan — a “campus road map” — to unify the buildings under the medical center’s jurisdiction on its site between First Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive south of 34th Street.

Its major components include the N.Y.U. School of Medicine, the Tisch Hospital, the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine and the Hospital for Joint Diseases, which is on 17th Street at Second Avenue. The medical center also provides the staff for Bellevue Hospital Center and the Veterans Affairs Hospital  nearby. Continue reading the main story

N.Y.U.’s medical school is the oldest of the institutions under the medical center’s umbrella, and the Langones’ gift is the largest in the school’s 167-year history, according to the dean, Dr. Robert I. Grossman. It is also one of the largest gifts to any medical school in the United States.Last year, Weill Medical College of Cornell University received $250 million from Sanford I. Weill, a former chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, and his wife, Joan. That was on top of two $100 million gifts from the Weills, the first in 1998, the other in 2002.The renaming of the medical center means that former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s father, Bernard, who is being treated for Parkinson’s disease, will be hospitalized in an institution that carries Mr. Langone’s name. As state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer and Mr. Langone tangled, and when Mr. Spitzer was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2006, Mr. Langone contributed to the campaign of Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive.At the time, Mr. Langone said Mr. Spitzer’s only motivation was “raw ambition for pure political gain.”The feud began when Mr. Spitzer sued Mr. Langone over the compensation package paid to Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Langone headed the exchange’s compensation committee during the years when Mr. Grasso took home his biggest payouts.Mr. Langone said on Tuesday that he had not known that Bernard Spitzer was a patient at N.Y.U. Medical Center.

“It’s ironic,” he said, “but one of the reasons Mrs. Langone and I are supporting the place is they do everything they can with passion to help every person who comes in there. I hope Mr. Spitzer’s father has a successful stay, and if there’s anything I can do, I’d be happy to do that.”Unlike many large donations to colleges and universities, the Langones’ gift is unrestricted, meaning that the Langones did not dictate how the money had to be spent.

But Mr. Langone has not been uninvolved in planning the medical center’s future. He was named chairman of its board nine years ago, and he said that after talking with his wife about taking on the job, “we concluded if I was going to be chairman of the place, I had to demonstrate some tangible commitment.”That led to the first $100 million. “But we wanted it done anonymously,” he said. “I didn’t want people to think I was just showing up and doing this.”Mr. Langone had no connection to the medical school until Martin Lipton, a mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer who is the chairman of the university’s board, approached him about taking on a role in leading the medical center. Mr. Langone earned a master’s degree in business administration from N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business in 1960, in an evening program that now bears his name.But he said that he and his wife were consumers at the medical center: Mrs. Langone had a hip replacement operation at the Hospital for Joint Diseases five weeks ago.“When I go through the place,” Mr. Langone said, as he does for routine blood tests, “it’s not unlike when I go into a Home Depot store.”Which is how, during a magnetic resonance imaging exam, he noticed that a light in the ceiling had burned out.“I’m laying on my back and I see a highhat   where the light’s out,” he recalled. “I go, ‘We’re spending tens of millions of dollars on equipment and we can’t afford a light bulb?’ I’m a bit of a type A.”The medical center said the other gifts it had raised were $45 million from Fiona Druckenmiller, a former portfolio manager for the Dreyfus Corporation, and her husband, Stanley F. Druckenmiller, the founder of Duquesne Capital, and $5 million from Marjorie and Walter Buckley, longtime friends of the Langones.

Ken Langone Jr. Takes on Wall Street. Loses.

In the Langone family, father is not like son – at least when it comes to investing. 



Bloomberg News
Kenneth Langone in Aug. 2008.



Kenneth G. Langone, of course, is a well-known name on Wall Street, one of the founding investors in Home Depot, who clashed famously with then-Attorney General Elliott Spitzer this decade over compensation practices at the New York Stock Exchange, where Langone was a director.
Kenneth G. Langone Jr., who is called “Kenny” by his father, is a 48 year-old, amateur musician, living in Tucson, Ariz., who doesn’t use email or the Internet and collects vintage records. 
Langone Jr. brought a case against Morgan Stanley before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, alleging that a local broker had made improper investment choices with his approximately $3 million account.

“They suggested that he grew up in a Wall Street family and knew more [about investing] than the average person,’’ said Langone Jr.’s lawyer, Mark Lammers, of Tuscon. 
“That’s nonsense,”  the elder Langone said in an interview. “Kenny had had no interest in the business and scant knowledge of it. That is why he relied heavily on his broker.” 
Langone’s father testified by phone twice on behalf of his son before a Finra arbitration panel. It didn’t matter. Last month, the panel dismissed the case and made Langone Jr. pay Morgan Stanley’s expert witness fees totaling $16,800 and the panel’s $9,600 of expenses.
“It’s unusual for the customer to be charged all of the fees,” says Richard Ryder, editor of Securities Arbitration Commentator, an online newsletter based in Maplewood, N.J., that tracks Finra arbitration cases. “It usually indicates some kind of implicit comment about the weakness of the claim.” Lammers says he is appealing some of those fees. A Finra spokesman declined to comment.
Morgan Stanley spokesman Christy Pollak said in a statement, ‘The arbitrators conducted a full and complete hearing over several days, heard the testimony of numerous fact and expert witnesses and concluded that Mr. Langone’s claims should be dismissed in their entirety. Their award speaks for itself.”
In an interview, the younger Langone said he wants to raise awareness about the Finra arbitration process, which he called, “the worst experience of my life.” He added:  “I was completely unprepared
