About Atossa











Atossa Genetics is a clinical-stage drug company developing novel, proprietary therapeutics and delivery methods for breast cancer and other breast conditions.
We believe our innovative therapies and delivery methods can transform breast cancer treatment– with the goals of preventing breast cancer from developing in the first place to increasing the odds of surviving for those who do develop this deadly disease.
Approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. Every two minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer; 40,000 die each year.
Tamoxifen has been widely used for over 30 years for breast cancer.  Additional research has shown that it is the metabolites of tamoxifen, of which endoxifen is the most active, that have potential therapeutic value.
We are the only company in the WORLD attempting to conquer breast cancer the way we are:

“The best way to treat a disease is to prevent it in the first place.”  We are developing a topical drug, a lotion applied to each breast, to treat a condition known as high breast density.  Third-party studies have shown that high breast density increases the risk of developing breast cancer in some women. Breast density is diagnosed by mammography and approximately 10 million women have high density in the U.S. Tamoxifen has been demonstrated to reduce density and the incidence of breast cancer.  However, tamoxifen can have serious side effects because, as a drug taken orally, it is delivered “systemically” meaning it travels throughout the body to other areas the drug is not needed. The goal with our topical endoxifen program is to treat high breast density with a local, topical drug.

 

“My biggest worry is that my breast cancer will return.”  We are also developing an oral formulation of endoxifen for breast cancer survivors who are otherwise recommended to take tamoxifen, the most commonly recommended FDA-approved drug to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.  Tamoxifen, however, does not work for up to 50% of these patients.  Our goal with this program is to reduce the number of patients who may get breast cancer again, even after initial treatment, by providing a drug for those who may not fully benefit from tamoxifen.

 

“Why am I receiving a needle injection – my cancer is in the breast, not the buttock.”  We are also developing a new way to deliver pharmaceuticals – through microcatheters (small tubes that can be inserted with anesthetic, through the nipple) so that pharmaceuticals can be targeted to the tissue where breast cancer actually grows.

Our proprietary oral and topical forms of endoxifen are the subject of a comprehensive Phase 1 clinical study in healthy women in Australia. Our patented microcatheter technology is in a Phase 2 clinical study that is also currently enrolling patients.  Read more about our programs.

SEATTLE, July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atossa Genetics Inc. (NASDAQ:ATOS), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics and delivery methods for breast cancer and other breast conditions, has now completed enrollment in its Phase 1 dose escalation study of Atossa's proprietary Endoxifen. Endoxifen is an active metabolite of the FDA-approved drug tamoxifen, which is currently used to treat breast cancer and for breast cancer prevention in high risk patients.
"We have now completed enrollment in both the oral and topical arms of our proprietary Endoxifen Phase 1 dose escalation study," commented Dr. Steven Quay, CEO and President of Atossa. "The speed at which this study fully-enrolled is a testament to the enthusiasm for potential new therapies in the breast cancer field, as well as the hard work and dedication of our CRO, CPR Pharma, and the personnel at Atossa.  We hope to report initial top-line data before the end of the quarter and then, subject to favorable Phase 1 results and other regulatory requirements, proceed to one or more Phase 2 studies using both our oral and topical formulations," added Dr. Quay.
The objectives of this double-blinded, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study of 48 healthy female subjects is to assess the pharmacokinetics of proprietary formulations of both oral and topical Endoxifen dosage forms over 28 days, as well as to assess safety and tolerability. The study is being conducted in two parts based on route of administration.
Atossa has also now completed the transfer of its Fulvestrant Microcatheter Phase 2 study from Columbia University Medical Center Breast Cancer Programs, where the study was initiated, to Montefiore Medical Center, New York, NY. 
"We are pleased to report that the study has been transferred to Montefiore, which is a nationally-ranked hospital," commented Dr. Quay. "While we cannot project the timing of completing enrollment in the study at this time, we look forward to providing updates as this clinical trial continues to advance," stated Dr. Quay.
The Fulvestrant Microcatheter Phase 2 study includes 30 women with ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer slated for mastectomy or lumpectomy. This study will assess the safety, tolerability and distribution of fulvestrant when delivered directly into breast milk ducts of these patients via microcatheters compared to those who receive the same product intramuscularly. The secondary objective of the study is to determine if there are changes in the expression of Ki67 as well as estrogen and progesterone receptors between a pre-fulvestrant biopsy and post-fulvestrant surgical specimen. Digital breast imaging before and after drug administration in both groups will also be performed to determine the effect of fulvestrant on any lesions as well as breast density of the participant. Six study participants will receive the standard intramuscular fulvestrant dose of 500 mg to establish the reference drug distribution, and 24 participants will receive fulvestrant by intraductal instillation utilizing Atossa's proprietary microcatheter technology.

Medical Device Voluntary Recall - News Release

1616 EastLake Ave East, Suite 510 Seattle, WA 98102 (800) 351-3902 www.atossagenetics.com www.GetForecyte.com www.nrlbh.com
On October 4, 2013 Atossa Genetics Inc. (NASDAQ: ATOS) initiated a voluntary recall to remove the ForeCYTE Breast Health Test and the Mammary Aspiration Specimen Cytology Test (MASCT) device from the market. This voluntary recall includes the MASCT System Kit and Patient Sample Kit. The vast majority of these products (approximately ninety percent) are in inventory with Atossa's distributors and the remaining quantities are at customer sites across the United States. Distributors and customers should stop using affected products and return them to Atossa immediately.
Atossa is removing the ForeCYTE Breast Health Test and the MASCT device from the market to address concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a warning letter received by Atossa in February 2013. The FDA raised concerns about (1) the current instructions for use (IFU); (2) certain promotional claims used to market these devices; and (3) the need for FDA clearance for certain changes made to the Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) specimen collection process identified in the current IFU. Atossa will remove existing product from the market until FDA's concerns are addressed.
The MASCT device has been cleared by the FDA for use as a sample collection device, with the provision that the fluid collected using this device can be used to determine and/or differentiate between normal, pre-cancerous, and cancerous cells. The MASCT device has not been cleared by the FDA for the screening or diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, the ForeCYTE Breast Health Test has not been cleared or approved by the FDA for any indication. The ForeCYTE Breast Health Test and the MASCT device are not a replacement for screening mammograms, diagnostic imaging tests, or biopsies. Patients should follow the recommendations and instructions of their physician with respect to breast cancer screening and diagnosis.
To date, Atossa is unaware of any adverse incidents or injuries associated with the use of the ForeCYTE Breast Health test and the MASCT device or the processing method currently identified in the IFU. Additionally, Atossa is unaware of any risk to health or injury for clinicians or the patient population that have used these devices. However, these devices may produce false positive or false negative results. Although not cleared or intended for this use, if these devices are used as a substitute for recommended screening or diagnosis of breast cancer, FDA is concerned that patients may choose to forgo recommended mammograms and necessary biopsies.
Atossa is working with the FDA on this matter and this voluntary recall. Atossa is notifying its distributors and customers by certified mail and is arranging for the return of all recalled product(s). Products affected by this recall are listed in the table below (table 1):

Quay, MD, Ph.D., FCAPCEO and PresidentAtossa Genetics, Inc.1616 Eastlake Avenue East, Suite 4411Seattle, Washington 98102 WARNING LETTER Dear Dr. Quay: During an inspection of your firm located in Seattle, Washington, on July 16, 2012, through July 25, 2012, an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures the Mammary Aspirate Specimen Cytology Test (MASCT) System, and MASCT System Collection Kit.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), [21 U.S.C. § 321(h)], these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body. This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the cGMP requirements of the Quality System regulation found under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a response from you dated August 6, 2012, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483) that was issued to you. We address the response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control the design of the device in order to ensure that specified design requirements are met, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(a). For example, (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that you have not established design control procedures for the MASCT System. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate.  While a procedure titled SOP-007, Design Control for the MASCT System was submitted in the response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all devices to ensure they had design control procedures in place as required for all devices. 2.      Failure to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, documentation, validation or where appropriate verification, review, and approval of design changes before their implementation, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(i). For example, (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that you have not established procedures for design changes for the MASCT System. You have performed multiple design changes, specifically: a.    You made a design change to a filter of the MASCT System prior to distribution; the only documentation covering the design change is email communication between your firm and the contract manufacturer; andb.    You are currently performing design changes to the MASCT System device and design verification testing has been performed for these design changes; however, Ms. Deborah H.P. Jae, your firm’s Marketing Director, indicated that no design inputs or outputs were established and no verification procedures were established for these design changes to the MASCT System. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-007, Design Control for the MASCT System was submitted in the response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, you did not provide evidence that you documented the design changes for the change to the filter of the MASCT System nor other changes made to the MASCT System, as required as a correction to this observation. Lastly, you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all devices to ensure it implemented design changes made to devices, as required. 3.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). For example, when asked by the investigator, Mr. (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that you have not established procedures for corrective and preventive action. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-005, Corrective and Preventive Action was submitted in the response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed previous corrective actions to ensure they were completed, as required. 4.      Failure to maintain adequate complaint files and to establish and maintain adequate procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a). For example, when asked by the investigator, Mr. (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that you have not established complaint handling procedures and that you do not have a formally designated unit for handling complaints. Your firm received a complaint in December 2011 and another in January 2012, concerning thread breakage of the MASCT System funnel; however, the complaints were not maintained in a complaint file. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-009, Customer Complaints was submitted in your response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, you did not provide evidence that you created a complaint file to include all complaints as required as a correction to this observation, nor did you indicate you retrospectively reviewed all complaints to ensure they were received, reviewed and evaluated as required as a corrective action to this observation. 5.      Failure to maintain an adequate record of investigation by a formally designated unit when an investigation is made under 21 CFR 820.198, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(e). For example, your firm received a complaint in December 2011, and another in January 2012, concerning thread breakage of the MASCT System funnel; however, the record of investigation for these complaints did not include all required information, such as the exact date a complaint was received, the address and phone number of the complainant, dates and results of the investigation, and correspondence with the complainant.  We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-009, Customer Complaints was submitted in your response, no evidence of implementation of or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, you did not provide evidence that you documented the record of the investigation of the complaint concerning the breakage of the MASCT System funnel received in December 2011 and January 2012 as required as a correction to this observation. Also, you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all other complaints to ensure that the investigations completed were documented as required as a corrective action to this observation. 6.      Failure to establish and maintain adequate requirements, including quality requirements, that must be met by suppliers, contractors, and consultants, as required by 21 CFR 820.50(a). For example, your firm contracts (b)(4); however, there is no documentation recording the evaluation and approval of these contractors. When asked by the investigator, (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that you have not established requirements that must be met by (b)(4). We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-006, Supplier Evaluation and Monitoring was submitted in your response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, your firm did not provide evidence that it evaluated (b)(4) as a supplier as a correction to this observation. Also, you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all suppliers to ensure they were evaluated, as required. 7.      Failure to establish procedures for quality audits and conduct such audits to assure that the quality system is in compliance with the established quality system requirements and to determine the effectiveness of the quality system, as required by 21 CFR 820.22. For example, when asked by the investigator, (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that your firm does not have procedures for quality audits. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-004, Internal Quality Audits was submitted in your response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, your firm did not provide evidence that it conducted a quality audit as required as a corrective action to this observation. Lastly, your firm did not provide evidence that it retrospectively reviewed all quality system procedures to ensure they were documented, as required. 8.      Failure of management with executive responsibility to review the suitability and effectiveness of the quality system at defined intervals and with sufficient frequency according to established procedures to ensure that the quality system satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 820 and the manufacturer’s established quality policy and objectives, as required by 21 CFR 820.20(c). For example, when asked by the investigator, (b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that your firm does not have procedures for management review. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. While a procedure titled SOP-003, Management Review was submitted in your response, no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided. In addition, your firm did not provide evidence that it conducted a management review as a corrective action, as required. 9.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that device history records for each batch, lot or unit are maintained to demonstrate that the device is manufactured in accordance with the device master record and the requirements of 21 CFR 820, as required by 21 CFR 820.184. For example, your firm lacks procedures for device history records for the MASCT System. When the investigator requested the device history record for the MASCT System, Ms. Deborah H. P. Jae, your firm’s Marketing Director, indicated that (b)(4) stated it did not maintain records for parts manufactured. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. The response states that SOP-007, Design Control for the MASCT System discusses the content of the device history record; however, this procedure addresses the content of a device history file and not a device history record. In addition, your firm did not provide evidence that it completed a device history record for the MASCT System, nor did your firm provide evidence that it would retrospectively review records for other devices to ensure device history records were documented, as required. 10.       Failure to establish a quality plan which defines the quality practices, resources, and activities relevant to devices that are designed and manufactured, as required by 21 CFR 820.20(d). For example, when asked by the investigator,(b)(4), your firm’s Regulatory Consultant, indicated that your firm has not established a quality plan. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. The response states that a Quality Policy has been established and that a Quality Manual will be established by September 7, 2012; however, no documentation was provided to support this response and no mention of a quality plan was discussed in the response. Our inspection also revealed that after the MASCT System device received 510(k) clearance (K030443) a modification to the Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) specimen collection process was made. The premarket notification submission (K030443) included Instructions For Use (IFU) stating to “Wash the collection membrane with fixative solution into the collection vial . . ..” Our inspection revealed your current IFU states “. . . apply one spray of Saccomanno’s Fixative to the collection membrane . . ..”  This change fixes the NAF specimen to the filter paper rather than washing it into a collection vial.     The aforementioned change to the device could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness and requires the submission of a 510(k) to FDA, as required by 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)(i). We have no record of receiving a 510(k) for this change to your product. Because you do not have marketing clearance from the FDA, marketing the changed product is a violation of the law. In legal terms, the product is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B), [21 U.S.C § 351(f)(1)(B)], and misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 352(o)]. Your product is misbranded under the Act because you did not submit a section 510(k) premarket notification, which is required by 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), that shows your device is substantially equivalent to other devices that are legally marketed.  Until you submit a section 510(k) premarket notification and FDA reviews it and notifies you that you may market your device, your product is also adulterated under the Act because the law requires, and you do not have, an approved premarket approval application that shows your device is safe and effective. For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency 21 CFR 807.81(b).  The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3122.html.  The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed. Our inspection, and subsequent review of your websites www.atossagenetics.com and www.nrlbh.com determined that your devices are misbranded under Section 502(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(a)] and within the meaning of 21 CFR 807.97, in that your websites contain statements that create an impression of official approval of a device due to clearance of a premarket notification submission.   Specifically, “. . . Using our patented, FDA-approved Mammary Aspirate Specimen Cytology Test (MASCT) System . . ..” “. . . FDA has determined, based on clinical trial data, that the MASCT System can be used in the determination and/or differentiation of normal versus premalignant versus malignant cells . . .” Any representation that creates an impression of official approval of a device due to compliance with the premarket notification regulations is misleading.  Your devices were not approved by the FDA, but were determined to be substantially equivalent within the meaning of Section 513(i)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 360c(i)(1)(A).  In addition, your ForeCYTE test is misbranded under section 502(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(a)] in that its labeling is false or misleading. Specifically, its labeling contains the following statement: “. . . FDA Cleared, clinically proven, and peer reviewed, the ForeCYTE test provides women aged 18 to 65 objective and actionable information to improve their breast health . . .” Your ForeCYTE test was not cleared by FDA. We acknowledge that you modified some of the language on your websites during the inspection, however, your websites still reference “. . . FDA-Cleared . . .” in many instances. Our inspection also revealed that your devices are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act 21 USC 352 (t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the devices that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 USC 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 – Medical Device Reporting (MDR) Regulation. Significant deviations include, but are not limited to: Failure to develop, maintain and implement written MDR procedures, as required by 21 CFR 803.17.  For example, your firm does not have a MDR procedure. We reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate. Your response did not address the lack of an MDR procedure. Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter.  Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice.  These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.  Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected. Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (including any systemic corrective actions) that your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Your firm’s response should be sent to: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Seattle District Office, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021. Refer to the WL SEA 13-13 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Compliance Officer Brenda L. Reihing at 425-302-0429. Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility.  It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.  The specific violations noted in this letter and in the FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems.  Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance  Sincerely,/S/Charles M. BreenDistrict Director

"In October our subsidiary, The National Reference Laboratory for Breast Health, Inc., or the NRLBH, began offering a new pharmacogenomics test" stated Dr. Steven C. Quay, Chairman, CEO and President. "These genetic tests, which help doctors prescribe drugs and doses best suited for each person, are being sold by the NRLBH's sales and marketing partner, BioVentive, Inc. In the past three weeks, the NRLBH has processed approximately 238 pharmacogenomics tests. We have been seeing a strong demand for pharmacogenomics tests and expect they will provide a positive financial contribution to our business while complementing our other tests under development. We also continue to make significant progress towards introducing the ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator into the European markets -- having now received the CE Mark -- and developing the FullCYTE Breast Aspirator for a planned launch in the United States."
Recent Corporate Developments 
Important recent corporate developments include the following:

The NRLBH launched pharmacogenomics testing in October and has now processed approximately 238 tests.
Hired Scott Youmans as Senior Vice President of Operations, a seasoned medical device executive.
Retained BioVentive, Inc. to provide sales and marketing services to the NRLBH.
Obtained a CE Mark for the ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator, which is a significant milestone in our plans to launch the device in key European markets.
Received a complete dismissal with prejudice of the securities class action lawsuit filed against Atossa and certain officers and directors in October 2013 (which the plaintiffs have now appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals).

Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results 
Revenue for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2014, totaled $3,426 and $37,425, consisting of additional cash collected in excess of the amounts we accrued previously at the Medicare rates. Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $76,597 and $585,345. Cost of revenue was $0 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $25,938 and $314,562 in the same periods in 2013.
For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2014, gross profit totaled $3,426 and $37,425, compared to $50,659 and $270,783 in the same period in 2013.
Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 were $3,248,681 consisting of general and administrative (G&A) expenses of $2,043,138, research and development (R&D) expenses of $923,169, and selling expenses of $282,374, representing an decrease of $303,875, or 9% from $3,552,556 in the same period in 2013, which consisted of G&A expenses of $2,858,027, R&D expenses of $321,111, and selling expenses of $373,418. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were $8,880,138 consisting of G&A expenses of $6,280,102, R&D expenses of $1,856,439, and selling expenses of $743,597. Operating expenses increased $582,678, or 7% from $8,297,460 for the same period in 2013, which consisted of $6,600,819 in G&A expenses, $731,258 in R&D expenses, and $965,383 in selling expenses.
G&A expenses decreased primarily as a result of lower capital raising commissions, lower recall expenses, lower consulting fees, lower advertising and marketing fees and lower bad debt expenses, offset by higher legal and regulatory and higher salaries, director fees and employees benefits. Selling expenses decreased primarily as a result of our reduced sales and marketing efforts after our voluntary recall in October 2013. R&D increased primarily as a result of increased expenditures on the development of our new products and tests in the pipeline, including the NextCYTE Test and FullCYTE microcatheters.
We expect that our G&A and selling expenses will increase in future periods as we hire additional administrative and manufacturing personnel to prepare for and execute on the launch of the ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator and FullCYTE Breast Aspirator, and our other products and services under development, and as we incur additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company. We also expect that our R&D expenses will continue to increase as we add additional full time employees and incur additional costs to continue the development of our products and services under development throughout 2014.

The clinical analysis of NAF, which contains cells and molecular diagnostic biomarkers, is useful in detecting breast cancer and cellular changes that may be precursors to breast cancer. The product component of the MASCT System consists of a reusable hand-held pump device for the collection of NAF, a patient kit that includes two NAF sample vials, and a shipment kit for the transportation of NAF samples to a specialized cytology and molecular diagnostics laboratory."We are pleased to be working with HLB on the manufacturing of sufficient MASCT System devices and kits for field testing as a final step before commercial launch," stated Steven C. Quay, M.D., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atossa Genetics. "HLB is widely recognized as a leading medical device and consumer product design company that has received more than a dozen awards for medical products over the years.""HLB is proud to be working again with Atossa on the MASCT System, another medical product created by the Meaningful Design™ system that is unique to HLB," stated Ford Pearson, President, HLB, LLC. "We are hopeful that the use of the MASCT System as an adjunct to mammography will provide a critical new assessment tool for identifying women at high risk for breast cancer."About the Mammary Aspirate Specimen Cytology Test System  The MASCT System, a "Pap test for breast cancer," is designed to collect nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), which contains cells from the lining of the milk ducts and the lobules where approximately 85% of all breast cancers originate. Once collected, the NAF sample will undergo analysis in Atossa's specially equipped pathology lab to determine whether the cells are normal, atypical (premalignant), or malignant. The MASCT System uses no radiation, is simple, painless, and inexpensive, and takes less than 5 minutes in a doctor's office or mammography center. The MASCT System is intended as an adjunct to mammography for women ages 40 to 75 and for younger women at high risk for breast cancer.The MASCT System is expected to be launched in the Pacific Northwest this year and across the U.S. in 2012.About Atossa Genetics, Inc. Atossa Genetics, Inc. is a privately held health care company dedicated to improving breast health by commercializing the Mammary Aspirate Specimen Cytology Test System (MASCT System) and second-generation products in development.

Atossa Genetics Launches Nationwide Awareness Program for Breast Cancer Prevention Test


Leave a reply 



New Video Highlights Atossa’s ForeCYTE Breast Health Test and Its Ability to Find Precancerous Conditions up to Eight Years Before Mammograms Find Cancer
 

SEATTLE, WA–(Marketwired – Apr 15, 2013) - Atossa Genetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATOS), The Breast Health Company™, today announced the launch of a new National Awareness Program, including a video to educate women and health care providers on the prevention of breast cancer by early testing for pre-cancerous breast conditions using The ForeCYTE Breast Health Test. The video is available on Atossa’s home page at www.atossagenetics.com and is being distributed directly to healthcare providers nationwide.
As the first step in the awareness program, Atossa has released the new video to inform women and their doctors about Atossa’s “Pap smear for the breast” for early detection of cancerous cells and pre-cancerous conditions. While mammograms can detect cancer, Atossa’s test detects treatable pre-cancerous conditions in the breast up to eight years before cancer arises. In women with certain pre-cancerous changes, breast cancer incidence can be reduced by as much as 86 percent with existing medical treatments.
In addition, women with dense breasts, whom research shows may be at a higher risk for breast cancer and for whom mammograms are often less reliable, can be tested easily with the ForeCYTE test in their healthcare providers’ office.
“Early testing for certain pre-cancerous conditions of the breast that, if left untreated, can lead to breast cancer, is immensely valuable to patients and their loved ones,” said Chris Destro, Vice President. “Our video(s), website, blog and interactive National Awareness Program are designed to be a new source of information for consumers and healthcare providers seeking to learn about new, non-invasive detection options, like the ForeCYTE test.”
In the video, Kathryn J. Wood, M.D., F.A.C.O.G, a Board Certified OB/GYN who now uses Atossa’s ForeCYTE Breast Health Test in her practice in the Dallas area, notes that early detection is key to saving lives and encourages her patients to be tested for pre-cancerous changes, which Atossa believes is important in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.
Updates to the Atossa National Awareness Program will be announced periodically and on CEO Dr. Steven Quay’s blog, which can be accessed through Atossa’s website at http://atossagenetics.com/blog/.
About the ForeCYTE Breast Health Test
The ForeCYTE Breast Health Test, intended for the 110 million women in the U.S. ages 18 to 73, is a painless, quick and non-invasive procedure that can be done in a physician’s office. A small sample of fluid, aspirated from the nipple of each breast with the Company’s modified breast pump, can provide vital early detection of cancer or pre-cancerous conditions that may progress to cancer over an approximately eight year period and before cancer can be detected by mammography or other means and without the risks of radiation, especially in women younger than age 50. No invasive biopsy needles or open surgical incisions are used in the Atossa test and the test is painless.
Just as the Pap smear has reduced cervical cancer rates by over 70 percent, becoming the most successful screening test in medicine, the goal of Atossa Genetics is to reduce the stubbornly high rate of breast cancer through the early detection of the precursor changes that can lead to breast cancer and the treatment of those early changes.
About Atossa Genetics, Inc.
Atossa Genetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATOS), The Breast Health Company™, is based in Seattle, WA, and is focused on preventing breast cancer through the commercialization of patented, FDA-designated Class II diagnostic medical devices and patented, laboratory developed tests (LDT) that can detect precursors to breast cancer up to eight years before mammography, and through research and development that will permit it to commercialize treatments for pre-cancerous lesions.
The National Reference Laboratory for Breast Health (NRLBH), a wholly owned subsidiary of Atossa Genetics, Inc., is a CLIA-certified high-complexity molecular diagnostic laboratory located in Seattle, WA, that provides the patented ForeCYTE Breast Health Test, a risk assessment test for women 18 to 73 years of age, and the ArgusCYTE Breast Health Test, a blood test for recurrence in breast cancer survivors that provides a “liquid biopsy” for circulating cancer cells and a tailored treatment plan for patients and their caregivers.
Forward-Looking Statements
Forward-looking statements in this press release are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated or estimated future results, including the risks and uncertainties associated with marketing plans, actions by the FDA, regulatory clearances, responses to regulatory matters, Atossa’s ability to continue to manufacture and sell its products, the efficacy of Atossa’s products and services, the market demand for and acceptance of Atossa’s products and services, performance of distributors and other risks detailed from time to time in Atossa’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation its registration statement on Form S-1 filed January 28, 2013, and periodic reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, each as amended and supplemented from time to time.

A Message from the Medical Director of the National Reference Laboratory for Breast Health on Breast Cancer and the ForeCYTE Breast Health Test


Leave a reply 


﻿﻿Dear Doctor,
In the United States each year over 1.3 million women are sent for a breast biopsy after a few scary weeks of imaging and tests.  These women become part of a group you worry about as their Gynecologist and Woman’s Healthcare Provider.  Thankfully, only about 235,000 will be diagnosed with breast cancer. But that leaves over one million women and their families left to continue to worry about a possible breast cancer.
Despite years of investment and research effort across multiple disciplines, the rate of breast cancer continues to exceed cervical cancer in women of all ages.  Your use of the PAP screen at the annual gynecology visit has reduced cervical cancer rates from 150 per year per 100,000 before the Pap smear to the rates shown below. In doing so, you have led the most successful screening program in the history of medicine.
Breast Cancer Incidence vs. Cervical Cancer Incidence
Today we need to broaden our focus to include breast health.
Atossa Genetics has developed a hand held and FDA cleared, clinically proven and peer reviewed system to sample nipple aspirate fluid from the breast duct system that can be done in your office or clinic on women ages 18-73.  Think of this as a Pap smear for the breast.
This non-invasive biopsy specimen will be sent to our National Reference Laboratory for Breast Health, the only CLIA-certified lab focused exclusively on tests for the prevention, diagnosis and monitoring of diseases of the breast.  When sent to our lab, the ForeCYTE Breast Health Test will be run on the NAF specimen, a multiplex test using five proteomic biomarkers of hyperplasia and one marker of sample integrity.
The ForeCYTE Breast Health Test evaluates the health of breast ducts, lobules, and the terminal lobular ductal unit (TLDU) by analyzing the protein and exfoliated cells in nipple aspirate fluid. The ForeCYTE test can provide vital early-detection of cancerous or pre-cancerous conditions years before they can be detected by other means and without the risks of radiation, especially in women younger than 50 years old.
More importantly, the ForeCYTE test can help you reassure your patients at their annual visit by providing their personal risk for breast cancer and communicate healthy lifestyle changes to maintain good health.  The unique test report from the NRLBH provides a tool to help you or your staff, educate and manage your patient’s health using the latest technology in cyto-pathology.
For more information and a clinical summary of the use of NAF in evaluating breast health, please call us at 1.800.351.3902 or visit our website, www.NRLBH.com.  I look forward to partnering with you to lower the breast cancer rate for your patients.

Sincerely,

Steven C Quay, MD, PhD, FCAP
Medical Director, National Reference Laboratory for Breast Health
Seattle, Washington

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
