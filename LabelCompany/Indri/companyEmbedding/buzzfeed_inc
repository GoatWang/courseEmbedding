BuzzFeed is an American internet media company based in New York City. The firm is a social news and entertainment company with a focus on digital media and digital technology.[5] BuzzFeed was founded in 2006 as a viral lab focusing on tracking viral content, by Jonah Peretti and John S. Johnson III.[6] Kenneth Lerer, co-founder and chairman of The Huffington Post, started as a co-founder and investor in BuzzFeed and is now the executive chairman as well.[6]
The company has grown into a global media and technology company providing coverage on a variety of topics including politics, DIY, animals and business.[7] In late 2011, Ben Smith of Politico was hired as editor-in-chief to expand the site into serious journalism, long-form journalism, and reportage.[8] The website has met criticism over accusations of plagiarism.[9][10][11][12]

History[edit]




Jonah Peretti founded BuzzFeed in November 2006


Origins[edit]
Prior to establishing BuzzFeed, Peretti was director of research and development and the OpenLab at Eyebeam, Johnson's New York City-based art and technology nonprofit, where he experimented with other viral media.[13][14]
While working at the Huffington Post, Peretti started BuzzFeed as a side project, in 2006, in partnership with his former supervisor John Johnson. In the beginning, BuzzFeed employed no writers or editors, just an "algorithm to cull stories from around the web that were showing stirrings of virality."[15] The site initially launched an instant messaging client, BuzzBot, which messaged users a link to popular content. The messages were sent based on algorithms which examined the links that were being quickly disseminated, scouring through the feeds of hundreds of blogs that were aggregating them. Later, the site began spotlighting the most popular links that BuzzBot found. Peretti hired curators to help describe the content that was popular around the web.[16] In 2011, Peretti hired Politico's Ben Smith, who earlier had achieved much attention as a political blogger, to assemble a news operation in addition to the many aggregated "listicles".
Funding[edit]
In August 2014, BuzzFeed raised $50 million from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, more than doubling previous rounds of funding.[17] The site was reportedly valued at around $850 million by Andreessen Horowitz.[17] BuzzFeed generates its advertising revenue through native advertising that matches its own editorial content, and does not rely on banner ads.[18] Buzzfeed also uses its familiarity with social media to target conventional advertising through other channels, such as Facebook.[19]
In December 2014, growth equity firm General Atlantic acquired $50M in secondary stock of the company.[20]
In August 2015, NBCUniversal made a $200 million equity investment in Buzzfeed.[21] Along with plans to hire more journalists to build a more prominent "investigative" unit, BuzzFeed is hiring journalists around the world and plans to open outposts in India, Germany, Mexico, and Japan.[22]
In October 2016, BuzzFeed raised $200 million from Comcast‚Äôs TV and movie arm NBCUniversal, at a valuation of roughly $1.7 billion.[23]
Acquisitions[edit]
BuzzFeed's first acquisition was in 2012 when the company purchased Kingfish Labs, a startup founded by Rob Fishman, initially focused on optimizing Facebook ads.[24]
On October 28, 2014, BuzzFeed announced its next acquisition, taking hold of Torando Labs. The Torando team was to become BuzzFeed's first data engineering team.[25]
Content[edit]
BuzzFeed produces daily content, in which the work of staff reporters, contributors, syndicated cartoon artists, and its community are featured. Popular formats on the website include lists, videos, and quizzes. While BuzzFeed initially was focused exclusively on such viral content, according to The New York Times, "it added more traditional content, building a track record for delivering breaking news and deeply reported articles" in the years up to 2014.[26] In that year, BuzzFeed deleted over 4000 early posts, "apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider", as observed by The New Yorker.[27]
BuzzFeed consistently ranked at the top of NewsWhip's "Facebook Publisher Rankings" from December 2013 to April 2014, until The Huffington Post entered the position.[28]
Video[edit]
BuzzFeed Video, BuzzFeed Motion Picture's flagship channel,[29] produces original content. Its production studio and team are based in Los Angeles. Since hiring Ze Frank in 2012, BuzzFeed Video has produced several video series including "The Creep Series", "The Try Guys", and "Fun Facts." In August 2014, the company announced a new division, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, which may produce feature-length films.[26] As of June 27, 2017, BuzzFeed Video's YouTube had garnered more than 10.2 billion views and more than 12.6 million subscribers.[30] It recently was announced that YouTube has signed on for two feature length series to be created by BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, entitled Broke and Squad Wars.[31]
Community[edit]
On July 17, 2012, humor website McSweeney's Internet Tendency published a satirical piece entitled "Suggested BuzzFeed Articles",[32] prompting BuzzFeed to create many of the suggestions.[33][34][35][36] BuzzFeed listed McSweeney's as a "Community Contributor."[33] The post subsequently received more than 350,000 page views,[34] prompted BuzzFeed to ask for user submissions,[33][37] and received media attention.[34][35][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][excessive citations] Subsequently, the website launched the "Community" section in May 2013 to enable users to submit content. Users initially are limited to publishing only one post per day, but may increase their submission capacity by raising their "Cat Power",[45] described on the BuzzFeed website as "an official measure of your rank in BuzzFeed's Community." A user's Cat Power increases as they achieve greater prominence on the site.[46]
Technology and social media[edit]
BuzzFeed receives the majority of its traffic by creating content that is shared on social media websites. BuzzFeed works by judging their content on how viral it will become. Operating in a ‚Äúcontinuous feedback loop‚Äù where all of its articles and videos are used as input for its sophisticated data operation.[19] The site continues to test and track their custom content with an in-house team of data scientists and external-facing ‚Äúsocial dashboard.‚Äù Using an algorithm dubbed "Viral Rank" created by Jonah Peretti and Duncan Watts, the company uses this formula to let editors, users, and advertisers try lots of different ideas, which maximizes distribution.[47] Staff writers are ranked by views on an internal leaderboard. In 2014, BuzzFeed received 75% of its views from links on social media outlets such as Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook.[18][26]
Tasty[edit]
BuzzFeed's video series on comfort food, Tasty, is made for Facebook, where it had almost eighty million followers as of January 2017[update].[not in citation given] The channel has substantially more views than BuzzFeed's dedicated food site.[48] The channel included five spinoff segments: "Tasty Junior"‚Äîwhich eventually spun off into its own page,[49] "Tasty Happy Hour" (alcoholic beverages), "Tasty Fresh", "Tasty Vegeterian", and "Tasty Story"‚Äîwhich has celebrities making and discussing their own recipes. Tasty has also released a cookbook.[50]
The company also operates these international versions of Tasty in other languages.[citation needed] Currently Tasty sponsored a new version of Tasty seasons named "Tasty Worth it" where the starring is Steven, Andrew and Adam to visit three different food places with varies of prices in one food category.
Notable stories[edit]
Trump dossier[edit]
Main article: Donald Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier
On January 10, 2017 CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that claimed Russia had compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump. Both Trump and President Barack Obama had been briefed on the content of the dossier the previous week. CNN did not publish the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier, as they could not be verified. Later the same day, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier in full.[51][52] BuzzFeed said that the dossier was unverified and "includes some clear errors".[53] The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and previously been sent to multiple journalists who had declined to publish it as unsubstantiated.[51] In response the next day, Trump called the website a "failing pile of garbage" during a news conference.[54] The publication of the dossier was also met with criticism from, among others, CNN reporter Jake Tapper, who called it irresponsible.[52] BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith defended the site's decision to publish the dossier.[55]
Aleksej Gubarev, chief of technology company XBT and a figure mentioned in the dossier, sued BuzzFeed on February 3, 2017. The suit, filed in a Broward County, Florida court,[56] centers on the allegations from the dossier that XBT had been "using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership."[57]
Traingate[edit]
In September 2016, Private Eye revealed that a Guardian story from August 16 on "Traingate" was written by a former Socialist Workers Party member who joined the Labour Party once Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader. The journalist also had a conflict of interest with the individual who filmed Corbyn on the floor of an allegedly-overcrowded train, something the Guardian did not mention in its reporting.[58] Paul Chadwich, the global readers editor for the Guardian, later stated that the story was published too quickly, with aspects of the story not being corroborated by third-party sources prior to reporting. The story proved to be an embarrassment for Corbyn and the Guardian.[59]
The story originally was submitted to BuzzFeed News, who rejected the article because its author had "attached a load of conditions around the words and he wanted it written his way", according to BuzzFeed UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson.[60]
Watermelon stunt[edit]
Main article: Exploding watermelon stunt
On April 8, 2016, BuzzFeed created a live stream on Facebook, during which two staffers wrapped rubber bands around a watermelon until the pressure of the rubber bands caused it to explode. The stunt was notable for drawing a very large online audience.[61]
"The dress"[edit]
Main article: The dress


The most interesting thing to me, is that it traveled. It went from New York media circle-jerk Twitter to international. And you could see it in my Twitter notifications because people started having conversations in, like, Spanish and Portuguese and then Japanese and Chinese and Thai and Arabic. It was amazing to watch this move from a local thing to, like, a massive international phenomenon.[62]

Cates Holderness
A post resulting in a debate over the color of an item of clothing from BuzzFeed's Tumblr editor Cates Holderness garnered more than 28 million views in one day, setting a record for most concurrent visitors to a BuzzFeed post.[63] Holderness had showed the picture to other members of the site's social media team, who immediately began arguing about the dress colors among themselves. After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took the subway back to her Brooklyn home. When she got off the train and checked her telephone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. "I couldn't open Twitter because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, maybe. I didn't know what was going on." Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors, which would reach 673,000 at its peak.[62][64]
Criticism and controversies[edit]




Benny Johnson was fired from BuzzFeed in July 2014 for plagiarism


BuzzFeed has been accused of plagiarizing original content from competitors throughout the online and offline press. On June 28, 2012, Gawker's Adrian Chen posted a story entitled "BuzzFeed and the Plagiarism Problem". In the article, Chen observed that one of BuzzFeed's most popular writers‚ÄîMatt Stopera‚Äîfrequently had copied and pasted "chunks of text into lists without attribution."[9] On March 8, 2013, The Atlantic Wire also published an article concerning BuzzFeed and plagiarism issues.[65]
BuzzFeed has been the subject of multiple copyright infringement lawsuits, for both using content it had no rights to and encouraging its proliferation without attributing its sources: one for an individual photographer's photograph,[66] and another for nine celebrity photographs from a single photography company.[67]
In July 2014, BuzzFeed writer Benny Johnson was accused of multiple instances of plagiarism.[10] Two anonymous Twitter users chronicled Johnson attributing work that was not his own, but "directly lift[ed] from other reporters, Wikipedia, and Yahoo! Answers," all without credit.[68] BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith initially defended Johnson, calling him a "deeply original writer".[11] Days later, Smith acknowledged that Johnson had plagiarized the work of others 40 times and announced that Johnson had been fired, and apologized to BuzzFeed readers. "Plagiarism, much less copying unchecked facts from Wikipedia or other sources, is an act of disrespect to the reader," Smith said. "We are deeply embarrassed and sorry to have misled you."[11] In total, 41 instances of plagiarism were found and corrected.[69] Johnson, who had previously worked for the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign, subsequently, was hired by the conservative magazine National Review as their social media editor.[70]
In October 2014, it was noted by the Pew Research Center that in the United States, BuzzFeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of people, regardless of political affiliation.[71][72][73]
In April 2015, BuzzFeed drew scrutiny after Gawker observed the publication had deleted two posts that criticized advertisers.[74] One of the posts criticized Dove soap (manufactured by Unilever), while another criticized Hasbro.[75] Both companies advertise with BuzzFeed. Ben Smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions. "I blew it," Smith wrote. "Twice in the past couple of months, I've asked editors‚Äîover their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process‚Äîto delete recently published posts from the site. Both involved the same thing: my overreaction to questions we've been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site. I reacted impulsively when I saw the posts and I was wrong to do that. We've reinstated both with a brief note."[76] Days later, one of the authors of the deleted posts, Arabelle Sicardi, resigned.[77] An internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements (by Microsoft, Pepsi, and Unilever).[78]
In September 2015, The Christian Post wrote that a video by BuzzFeed entitled I'm Christian But I'm Not... was getting criticism from conservative Christians for not specifically mentioning Christ or certain Biblical values.[79]
In 2016, the Advertising Standards Authority of the United Kingdom ruled that BuzzFeed broke the UK advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on "14 Laundry Fails We've All Experienced" that promoted Dylon was an online advertorial paid for by the brand.[80][81] Although the ASA agreed with BuzzFeed's defence that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as "sponsored content", this failed to take into account that many people may link to the story directly, ruling that the labelling "was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser".[81][82]
In February 2016, Scaachi Koul, a Senior Writer for BuzzFeed Canada tweeted a request for pitches stating that BuzzFeed was "...looking for mostly non-white non-men" followed by "If you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for non-white non-men I don't care about you go write for Maclean's." When confronted, she followed with the tweet "White men are still permitted to pitch, I will read it, I will consider it. I'm just less interested because, ugh, men." In response to the tweets, Koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults.[83][84] Sarmishta Subramanian, a former colleague of Koul's writing for Maclean's condemned the reaction to the tweets, and commented that Koul's request for diversity was appropriate. Subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of tokenism that might hamper BuzzFeed's stated goals.[85]

BuzzFeed is an American internet media company based in New York City. The firm is a social news and entertainment company with a focus on digital media and digital technology.[5] BuzzFeed was founded in 2006 as a viral lab focusing on tracking viral content, by Jonah Peretti and John S. Johnson III.[6] Kenneth Lerer, co-founder and chairman of The Huffington Post, started as a co-founder and investor in BuzzFeed and is now the executive chairman as well.[6]
The company has grown into a global media and technology company providing coverage on a variety of topics including politics, DIY, animals and business.[7] In late 2011, Ben Smith of Politico was hired as editor-in-chief to expand the site into serious journalism, long-form journalism, and reportage.[8] The website has met criticism over accusations of plagiarism.[9][10][11][12]

History[edit]




Jonah Peretti founded BuzzFeed in November 2006


Origins[edit]
Prior to establishing BuzzFeed, Peretti was director of research and development and the OpenLab at Eyebeam, Johnson's New York City-based art and technology nonprofit, where he experimented with other viral media.[13][14]
While working at the Huffington Post, Peretti started BuzzFeed as a side project, in 2006, in partnership with his former supervisor John Johnson. In the beginning, BuzzFeed employed no writers or editors, just an "algorithm to cull stories from around the web that were showing stirrings of virality."[15] The site initially launched an instant messaging client, BuzzBot, which messaged users a link to popular content. The messages were sent based on algorithms which examined the links that were being quickly disseminated, scouring through the feeds of hundreds of blogs that were aggregating them. Later, the site began spotlighting the most popular links that BuzzBot found. Peretti hired curators to help describe the content that was popular around the web.[16] In 2011, Peretti hired Politico's Ben Smith, who earlier had achieved much attention as a political blogger, to assemble a news operation in addition to the many aggregated "listicles".
Funding[edit]
In August 2014, BuzzFeed raised $50 million from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, more than doubling previous rounds of funding.[17] The site was reportedly valued at around $850 million by Andreessen Horowitz.[17] BuzzFeed generates its advertising revenue through native advertising that matches its own editorial content, and does not rely on banner ads.[18] Buzzfeed also uses its familiarity with social media to target conventional advertising through other channels, such as Facebook.[19]
In December 2014, growth equity firm General Atlantic acquired $50M in secondary stock of the company.[20]
In August 2015, NBCUniversal made a $200 million equity investment in Buzzfeed.[21] Along with plans to hire more journalists to build a more prominent "investigative" unit, BuzzFeed is hiring journalists around the world and plans to open outposts in India, Germany, Mexico, and Japan.[22]
In October 2016, BuzzFeed raised $200 million from Comcast‚Äôs TV and movie arm NBCUniversal, at a valuation of roughly $1.7 billion.[23]
Acquisitions[edit]
BuzzFeed's first acquisition was in 2012 when the company purchased Kingfish Labs, a startup founded by Rob Fishman, initially focused on optimizing Facebook ads.[24]
On October 28, 2014, BuzzFeed announced its next acquisition, taking hold of Torando Labs. The Torando team was to become BuzzFeed's first data engineering team.[25]
Content[edit]
BuzzFeed produces daily content, in which the work of staff reporters, contributors, syndicated cartoon artists, and its community are featured. Popular formats on the website include lists, videos, and quizzes. While BuzzFeed initially was focused exclusively on such viral content, according to The New York Times, "it added more traditional content, building a track record for delivering breaking news and deeply reported articles" in the years up to 2014.[26] In that year, BuzzFeed deleted over 4000 early posts, "apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider", as observed by The New Yorker.[27]
BuzzFeed consistently ranked at the top of NewsWhip's "Facebook Publisher Rankings" from December 2013 to April 2014, until The Huffington Post entered the position.[28]
Video[edit]
BuzzFeed Video, BuzzFeed Motion Picture's flagship channel,[29] produces original content. Its production studio and team are based in Los Angeles. Since hiring Ze Frank in 2012, BuzzFeed Video has produced several video series including "The Creep Series", "The Try Guys", and "Fun Facts." In August 2014, the company announced a new division, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, which may produce feature-length films.[26] As of June 27, 2017, BuzzFeed Video's YouTube had garnered more than 10.2 billion views and more than 12.6 million subscribers.[30] It recently was announced that YouTube has signed on for two feature length series to be created by BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, entitled Broke and Squad Wars.[31]
Community[edit]
On July 17, 2012, humor website McSweeney's Internet Tendency published a satirical piece entitled "Suggested BuzzFeed Articles",[32] prompting BuzzFeed to create many of the suggestions.[33][34][35][36] BuzzFeed listed McSweeney's as a "Community Contributor."[33] The post subsequently received more than 350,000 page views,[34] prompted BuzzFeed to ask for user submissions,[33][37] and received media attention.[34][35][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][excessive citations] Subsequently, the website launched the "Community" section in May 2013 to enable users to submit content. Users initially are limited to publishing only one post per day, but may increase their submission capacity by raising their "Cat Power",[45] described on the BuzzFeed website as "an official measure of your rank in BuzzFeed's Community." A user's Cat Power increases as they achieve greater prominence on the site.[46]
Technology and social media[edit]
BuzzFeed receives the majority of its traffic by creating content that is shared on social media websites. BuzzFeed works by judging their content on how viral it will become. Operating in a ‚Äúcontinuous feedback loop‚Äù where all of its articles and videos are used as input for its sophisticated data operation.[19] The site continues to test and track their custom content with an in-house team of data scientists and external-facing ‚Äúsocial dashboard.‚Äù Using an algorithm dubbed "Viral Rank" created by Jonah Peretti and Duncan Watts, the company uses this formula to let editors, users, and advertisers try lots of different ideas, which maximizes distribution.[47] Staff writers are ranked by views on an internal leaderboard. In 2014, BuzzFeed received 75% of its views from links on social media outlets such as Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook.[18][26]
Tasty[edit]
BuzzFeed's video series on comfort food, Tasty, is made for Facebook, where it had almost eighty million followers as of January 2017[update].[not in citation given] The channel has substantially more views than BuzzFeed's dedicated food site.[48] The channel included five spinoff segments: "Tasty Junior"‚Äîwhich eventually spun off into its own page,[49] "Tasty Happy Hour" (alcoholic beverages), "Tasty Fresh", "Tasty Vegeterian", and "Tasty Story"‚Äîwhich has celebrities making and discussing their own recipes. Tasty has also released a cookbook.[50]
The company also operates these international versions of Tasty in other languages.[citation needed] Currently Tasty sponsored a new version of Tasty seasons named "Tasty Worth it" where the starring is Steven, Andrew and Adam to visit three different food places with varies of prices in one food category.
Notable stories[edit]
Trump dossier[edit]
Main article: Donald Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier
On January 10, 2017 CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that claimed Russia had compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump. Both Trump and President Barack Obama had been briefed on the content of the dossier the previous week. CNN did not publish the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier, as they could not be verified. Later the same day, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier in full.[51][52] BuzzFeed said that the dossier was unverified and "includes some clear errors".[53] The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and previously been sent to multiple journalists who had declined to publish it as unsubstantiated.[51] In response the next day, Trump called the website a "failing pile of garbage" during a news conference.[54] The publication of the dossier was also met with criticism from, among others, CNN reporter Jake Tapper, who called it irresponsible.[52] BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith defended the site's decision to publish the dossier.[55]
Aleksej Gubarev, chief of technology company XBT and a figure mentioned in the dossier, sued BuzzFeed on February 3, 2017. The suit, filed in a Broward County, Florida court,[56] centers on the allegations from the dossier that XBT had been "using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership."[57]
Traingate[edit]
In September 2016, Private Eye revealed that a Guardian story from August 16 on "Traingate" was written by a former Socialist Workers Party member who joined the Labour Party once Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader. The journalist also had a conflict of interest with the individual who filmed Corbyn on the floor of an allegedly-overcrowded train, something the Guardian did not mention in its reporting.[58] Paul Chadwich, the global readers editor for the Guardian, later stated that the story was published too quickly, with aspects of the story not being corroborated by third-party sources prior to reporting. The story proved to be an embarrassment for Corbyn and the Guardian.[59]
The story originally was submitted to BuzzFeed News, who rejected the article because its author had "attached a load of conditions around the words and he wanted it written his way", according to BuzzFeed UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson.[60]
Watermelon stunt[edit]
Main article: Exploding watermelon stunt
On April 8, 2016, BuzzFeed created a live stream on Facebook, during which two staffers wrapped rubber bands around a watermelon until the pressure of the rubber bands caused it to explode. The stunt was notable for drawing a very large online audience.[61]
"The dress"[edit]
Main article: The dress


The most interesting thing to me, is that it traveled. It went from New York media circle-jerk Twitter to international. And you could see it in my Twitter notifications because people started having conversations in, like, Spanish and Portuguese and then Japanese and Chinese and Thai and Arabic. It was amazing to watch this move from a local thing to, like, a massive international phenomenon.[62]

Cates Holderness
A post resulting in a debate over the color of an item of clothing from BuzzFeed's Tumblr editor Cates Holderness garnered more than 28 million views in one day, setting a record for most concurrent visitors to a BuzzFeed post.[63] Holderness had showed the picture to other members of the site's social media team, who immediately began arguing about the dress colors among themselves. After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took the subway back to her Brooklyn home. When she got off the train and checked her telephone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. "I couldn't open Twitter because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, maybe. I didn't know what was going on." Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors, which would reach 673,000 at its peak.[62][64]
Criticism and controversies[edit]




Benny Johnson was fired from BuzzFeed in July 2014 for plagiarism


BuzzFeed has been accused of plagiarizing original content from competitors throughout the online and offline press. On June 28, 2012, Gawker's Adrian Chen posted a story entitled "BuzzFeed and the Plagiarism Problem". In the article, Chen observed that one of BuzzFeed's most popular writers‚ÄîMatt Stopera‚Äîfrequently had copied and pasted "chunks of text into lists without attribution."[9] On March 8, 2013, The Atlantic Wire also published an article concerning BuzzFeed and plagiarism issues.[65]
BuzzFeed has been the subject of multiple copyright infringement lawsuits, for both using content it had no rights to and encouraging its proliferation without attributing its sources: one for an individual photographer's photograph,[66] and another for nine celebrity photographs from a single photography company.[67]
In July 2014, BuzzFeed writer Benny Johnson was accused of multiple instances of plagiarism.[10] Two anonymous Twitter users chronicled Johnson attributing work that was not his own, but "directly lift[ed] from other reporters, Wikipedia, and Yahoo! Answers," all without credit.[68] BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith initially defended Johnson, calling him a "deeply original writer".[11] Days later, Smith acknowledged that Johnson had plagiarized the work of others 40 times and announced that Johnson had been fired, and apologized to BuzzFeed readers. "Plagiarism, much less copying unchecked facts from Wikipedia or other sources, is an act of disrespect to the reader," Smith said. "We are deeply embarrassed and sorry to have misled you."[11] In total, 41 instances of plagiarism were found and corrected.[69] Johnson, who had previously worked for the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign, subsequently, was hired by the conservative magazine National Review as their social media editor.[70]
In October 2014, it was noted by the Pew Research Center that in the United States, BuzzFeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of people, regardless of political affiliation.[71][72][73]
In April 2015, BuzzFeed drew scrutiny after Gawker observed the publication had deleted two posts that criticized advertisers.[74] One of the posts criticized Dove soap (manufactured by Unilever), while another criticized Hasbro.[75] Both companies advertise with BuzzFeed. Ben Smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions. "I blew it," Smith wrote. "Twice in the past couple of months, I've asked editors‚Äîover their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process‚Äîto delete recently published posts from the site. Both involved the same thing: my overreaction to questions we've been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site. I reacted impulsively when I saw the posts and I was wrong to do that. We've reinstated both with a brief note."[76] Days later, one of the authors of the deleted posts, Arabelle Sicardi, resigned.[77] An internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements (by Microsoft, Pepsi, and Unilever).[78]
In September 2015, The Christian Post wrote that a video by BuzzFeed entitled I'm Christian But I'm Not... was getting criticism from conservative Christians for not specifically mentioning Christ or certain Biblical values.[79]
In 2016, the Advertising Standards Authority of the United Kingdom ruled that BuzzFeed broke the UK advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on "14 Laundry Fails We've All Experienced" that promoted Dylon was an online advertorial paid for by the brand.[80][81] Although the ASA agreed with BuzzFeed's defence that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as "sponsored content", this failed to take into account that many people may link to the story directly, ruling that the labelling "was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser".[81][82]
In February 2016, Scaachi Koul, a Senior Writer for BuzzFeed Canada tweeted a request for pitches stating that BuzzFeed was "...looking for mostly non-white non-men" followed by "If you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for non-white non-men I don't care about you go write for Maclean's." When confronted, she followed with the tweet "White men are still permitted to pitch, I will read it, I will consider it. I'm just less interested because, ugh, men." In response to the tweets, Koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults.[83][84] Sarmishta Subramanian, a former colleague of Koul's writing for Maclean's condemned the reaction to the tweets, and commented that Koul's request for diversity was appropriate. Subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of tokenism that might hamper BuzzFeed's stated goals.[85]

The two college students went viral after Josh posted their hilarious Tinder conversation on social media. Both stuck with the same joke for three years: One would send a message, and the other would answer months later.

People loved the story, and so did Tinder ‚Äî so much that the dating app agreed to send them to any location. They picked Maui.

The two college students went viral after Josh posted their hilarious Tinder conversation on social media. Both stuck with the same joke for three years: One would send a message, and the other would answer months later.

And each respective side thinks they're right.







Apparently, people either wash chicken before cooking it OR completely bypass the washing step.

And FYI, I've looked at numerous polls and found that the results above are highly variable, i.e., there is no clear majority!







Personally, I've NEVER washed raw chicken in my life and I'm baffled that this is a practice.

To add to my confusion, I did a little more digging and found that the FDA definitively recommends that you do NOT wash your chicken before cooking it, as this "may increase the risk of contaminating other foods and surfaces." But a ton of people still do it:

And each respective side thinks they're right.







Apparently, people either wash chicken before cooking it OR completely bypass the washing step.

And FYI, I've looked at numerous polls and found that the results above are highly variable, i.e., there is no clear majority!







Personally, I've NEVER washed raw chicken in my life and I'm baffled that this is a practice.

BuzzFeed is an American internet media company based in New York City. The firm is a social news and entertainment company with a focus on digital media and digital technology.[5] BuzzFeed was founded in 2006 as a viral lab focusing on tracking viral content, by Jonah Peretti and John S. Johnson III.[6] Kenneth Lerer, co-founder and chairman of The Huffington Post, started as a co-founder and investor in BuzzFeed and is now the executive chairman as well.[6]
The company has grown into a global media and technology company providing coverage on a variety of topics including politics, DIY, animals and business.[7] In late 2011, Ben Smith of Politico was hired as editor-in-chief to expand the site into serious journalism, long-form journalism, and reportage.[8] The website has met criticism over accusations of plagiarism.[9][10][11][12]

History[edit]




Jonah Peretti founded BuzzFeed in November 2006


Origins[edit]
Prior to establishing BuzzFeed, Peretti was director of research and development and the OpenLab at Eyebeam, Johnson's New York City-based art and technology nonprofit, where he experimented with other viral media.[13][14]
While working at the Huffington Post, Peretti started BuzzFeed as a side project, in 2006, in partnership with his former supervisor John Johnson. In the beginning, BuzzFeed employed no writers or editors, just an "algorithm to cull stories from around the web that were showing stirrings of virality."[15] The site initially launched an instant messaging client, BuzzBot, which messaged users a link to popular content. The messages were sent based on algorithms which examined the links that were being quickly disseminated, scouring through the feeds of hundreds of blogs that were aggregating them. Later, the site began spotlighting the most popular links that BuzzBot found. Peretti hired curators to help describe the content that was popular around the web.[16] In 2011, Peretti hired Politico's Ben Smith, who earlier had achieved much attention as a political blogger, to assemble a news operation in addition to the many aggregated "listicles".
Funding[edit]
In August 2014, BuzzFeed raised $50 million from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, more than doubling previous rounds of funding.[17] The site was reportedly valued at around $850 million by Andreessen Horowitz.[17] BuzzFeed generates its advertising revenue through native advertising that matches its own editorial content, and does not rely on banner ads.[18] Buzzfeed also uses its familiarity with social media to target conventional advertising through other channels, such as Facebook.[19]
In December 2014, growth equity firm General Atlantic acquired $50M in secondary stock of the company.[20]
In August 2015, NBCUniversal made a $200 million equity investment in Buzzfeed.[21] Along with plans to hire more journalists to build a more prominent "investigative" unit, BuzzFeed is hiring journalists around the world and plans to open outposts in India, Germany, Mexico, and Japan.[22]
In October 2016, BuzzFeed raised $200 million from Comcast‚Äôs TV and movie arm NBCUniversal, at a valuation of roughly $1.7 billion.[23]
Acquisitions[edit]
BuzzFeed's first acquisition was in 2012 when the company purchased Kingfish Labs, a startup founded by Rob Fishman, initially focused on optimizing Facebook ads.[24]
On October 28, 2014, BuzzFeed announced its next acquisition, taking hold of Torando Labs. The Torando team was to become BuzzFeed's first data engineering team.[25]
Content[edit]
BuzzFeed produces daily content, in which the work of staff reporters, contributors, syndicated cartoon artists, and its community are featured. Popular formats on the website include lists, videos, and quizzes. While BuzzFeed initially was focused exclusively on such viral content, according to The New York Times, "it added more traditional content, building a track record for delivering breaking news and deeply reported articles" in the years up to 2014.[26] In that year, BuzzFeed deleted over 4000 early posts, "apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider", as observed by The New Yorker.[27]
BuzzFeed consistently ranked at the top of NewsWhip's "Facebook Publisher Rankings" from December 2013 to April 2014, until The Huffington Post entered the position.[28]
Video[edit]
BuzzFeed Video, BuzzFeed Motion Picture's flagship channel,[29] produces original content. Its production studio and team are based in Los Angeles. Since hiring Ze Frank in 2012, BuzzFeed Video has produced several video series including "The Creep Series", "The Try Guys", and "Fun Facts." In August 2014, the company announced a new division, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, which may produce feature-length films.[26] As of June 27, 2017, BuzzFeed Video's YouTube had garnered more than 10.2 billion views and more than 12.6 million subscribers.[30] It recently was announced that YouTube has signed on for two feature length series to be created by BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, entitled Broke and Squad Wars.[31]
Community[edit]
On July 17, 2012, humor website McSweeney's Internet Tendency published a satirical piece entitled "Suggested BuzzFeed Articles",[32] prompting BuzzFeed to create many of the suggestions.[33][34][35][36] BuzzFeed listed McSweeney's as a "Community Contributor."[33] The post subsequently received more than 350,000 page views,[34] prompted BuzzFeed to ask for user submissions,[33][37] and received media attention.[34][35][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][excessive citations] Subsequently, the website launched the "Community" section in May 2013 to enable users to submit content. Users initially are limited to publishing only one post per day, but may increase their submission capacity by raising their "Cat Power",[45] described on the BuzzFeed website as "an official measure of your rank in BuzzFeed's Community." A user's Cat Power increases as they achieve greater prominence on the site.[46]
Technology and social media[edit]
BuzzFeed receives the majority of its traffic by creating content that is shared on social media websites. BuzzFeed works by judging their content on how viral it will become. Operating in a ‚Äúcontinuous feedback loop‚Äù where all of its articles and videos are used as input for its sophisticated data operation.[19] The site continues to test and track their custom content with an in-house team of data scientists and external-facing ‚Äúsocial dashboard.‚Äù Using an algorithm dubbed "Viral Rank" created by Jonah Peretti and Duncan Watts, the company uses this formula to let editors, users, and advertisers try lots of different ideas, which maximizes distribution.[47] Staff writers are ranked by views on an internal leaderboard. In 2014, BuzzFeed received 75% of its views from links on social media outlets such as Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook.[18][26]
Tasty[edit]
BuzzFeed's video series on comfort food, Tasty, is made for Facebook, where it had almost eighty million followers as of January 2017[update].[not in citation given] The channel has substantially more views than BuzzFeed's dedicated food site.[48] The channel included five spinoff segments: "Tasty Junior"‚Äîwhich eventually spun off into its own page,[49] "Tasty Happy Hour" (alcoholic beverages), "Tasty Fresh", "Tasty Vegeterian", and "Tasty Story"‚Äîwhich has celebrities making and discussing their own recipes. Tasty has also released a cookbook.[50]
The company also operates these international versions of Tasty in other languages.[citation needed] Currently Tasty sponsored a new version of Tasty seasons named "Tasty Worth it" where the starring is Steven, Andrew and Adam to visit three different food places with varies of prices in one food category.
Notable stories[edit]
Trump dossier[edit]
Main article: Donald Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier
On January 10, 2017 CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that claimed Russia had compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump. Both Trump and President Barack Obama had been briefed on the content of the dossier the previous week. CNN did not publish the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier, as they could not be verified. Later the same day, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier in full.[51][52] BuzzFeed said that the dossier was unverified and "includes some clear errors".[53] The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and previously been sent to multiple journalists who had declined to publish it as unsubstantiated.[51] In response the next day, Trump called the website a "failing pile of garbage" during a news conference.[54] The publication of the dossier was also met with criticism from, among others, CNN reporter Jake Tapper, who called it irresponsible.[52] BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith defended the site's decision to publish the dossier.[55]
Aleksej Gubarev, chief of technology company XBT and a figure mentioned in the dossier, sued BuzzFeed on February 3, 2017. The suit, filed in a Broward County, Florida court,[56] centers on the allegations from the dossier that XBT had been "using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership."[57]
Traingate[edit]
In September 2016, Private Eye revealed that a Guardian story from August 16 on "Traingate" was written by a former Socialist Workers Party member who joined the Labour Party once Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader. The journalist also had a conflict of interest with the individual who filmed Corbyn on the floor of an allegedly-overcrowded train, something the Guardian did not mention in its reporting.[58] Paul Chadwich, the global readers editor for the Guardian, later stated that the story was published too quickly, with aspects of the story not being corroborated by third-party sources prior to reporting. The story proved to be an embarrassment for Corbyn and the Guardian.[59]
The story originally was submitted to BuzzFeed News, who rejected the article because its author had "attached a load of conditions around the words and he wanted it written his way", according to BuzzFeed UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson.[60]
Watermelon stunt[edit]
Main article: Exploding watermelon stunt
On April 8, 2016, BuzzFeed created a live stream on Facebook, during which two staffers wrapped rubber bands around a watermelon until the pressure of the rubber bands caused it to explode. The stunt was notable for drawing a very large online audience.[61]
"The dress"[edit]
Main article: The dress


The most interesting thing to me, is that it traveled. It went from New York media circle-jerk Twitter to international. And you could see it in my Twitter notifications because people started having conversations in, like, Spanish and Portuguese and then Japanese and Chinese and Thai and Arabic. It was amazing to watch this move from a local thing to, like, a massive international phenomenon.[62]

Cates Holderness
A post resulting in a debate over the color of an item of clothing from BuzzFeed's Tumblr editor Cates Holderness garnered more than 28 million views in one day, setting a record for most concurrent visitors to a BuzzFeed post.[63] Holderness had showed the picture to other members of the site's social media team, who immediately began arguing about the dress colors among themselves. After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took the subway back to her Brooklyn home. When she got off the train and checked her telephone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. "I couldn't open Twitter because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, maybe. I didn't know what was going on." Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors, which would reach 673,000 at its peak.[62][64]
Criticism and controversies[edit]




Benny Johnson was fired from BuzzFeed in July 2014 for plagiarism


BuzzFeed has been accused of plagiarizing original content from competitors throughout the online and offline press. On June 28, 2012, Gawker's Adrian Chen posted a story entitled "BuzzFeed and the Plagiarism Problem". In the article, Chen observed that one of BuzzFeed's most popular writers‚ÄîMatt Stopera‚Äîfrequently had copied and pasted "chunks of text into lists without attribution."[9] On March 8, 2013, The Atlantic Wire also published an article concerning BuzzFeed and plagiarism issues.[65]
BuzzFeed has been the subject of multiple copyright infringement lawsuits, for both using content it had no rights to and encouraging its proliferation without attributing its sources: one for an individual photographer's photograph,[66] and another for nine celebrity photographs from a single photography company.[67]
In July 2014, BuzzFeed writer Benny Johnson was accused of multiple instances of plagiarism.[10] Two anonymous Twitter users chronicled Johnson attributing work that was not his own, but "directly lift[ed] from other reporters, Wikipedia, and Yahoo! Answers," all without credit.[68] BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith initially defended Johnson, calling him a "deeply original writer".[11] Days later, Smith acknowledged that Johnson had plagiarized the work of others 40 times and announced that Johnson had been fired, and apologized to BuzzFeed readers. "Plagiarism, much less copying unchecked facts from Wikipedia or other sources, is an act of disrespect to the reader," Smith said. "We are deeply embarrassed and sorry to have misled you."[11] In total, 41 instances of plagiarism were found and corrected.[69] Johnson, who had previously worked for the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign, subsequently, was hired by the conservative magazine National Review as their social media editor.[70]
In October 2014, it was noted by the Pew Research Center that in the United States, BuzzFeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of people, regardless of political affiliation.[71][72][73]
In April 2015, BuzzFeed drew scrutiny after Gawker observed the publication had deleted two posts that criticized advertisers.[74] One of the posts criticized Dove soap (manufactured by Unilever), while another criticized Hasbro.[75] Both companies advertise with BuzzFeed. Ben Smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions. "I blew it," Smith wrote. "Twice in the past couple of months, I've asked editors‚Äîover their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process‚Äîto delete recently published posts from the site. Both involved the same thing: my overreaction to questions we've been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site. I reacted impulsively when I saw the posts and I was wrong to do that. We've reinstated both with a brief note."[76] Days later, one of the authors of the deleted posts, Arabelle Sicardi, resigned.[77] An internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements (by Microsoft, Pepsi, and Unilever).[78]
In September 2015, The Christian Post wrote that a video by BuzzFeed entitled I'm Christian But I'm Not... was getting criticism from conservative Christians for not specifically mentioning Christ or certain Biblical values.[79]
In 2016, the Advertising Standards Authority of the United Kingdom ruled that BuzzFeed broke the UK advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on "14 Laundry Fails We've All Experienced" that promoted Dylon was an online advertorial paid for by the brand.[80][81] Although the ASA agreed with BuzzFeed's defence that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as "sponsored content", this failed to take into account that many people may link to the story directly, ruling that the labelling "was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser".[81][82]
In February 2016, Scaachi Koul, a Senior Writer for BuzzFeed Canada tweeted a request for pitches stating that BuzzFeed was "...looking for mostly non-white non-men" followed by "If you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for non-white non-men I don't care about you go write for Maclean's." When confronted, she followed with the tweet "White men are still permitted to pitch, I will read it, I will consider it. I'm just less interested because, ugh, men." In response to the tweets, Koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults.[83][84] Sarmishta Subramanian, a former colleague of Koul's writing for Maclean's condemned the reaction to the tweets, and commented that Koul's request for diversity was appropriate. Subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of tokenism that might hamper BuzzFeed's stated goals.[85]
