Northern Trust Names Peter Cherecwich as Head of Global Fund Services 
      Unit




Regional directors appointed to support continuing growth






November 22, 2010 09:28 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Northern Trust announced today that it has appointed Peter Cherecwich as 
      head of Global Fund Services (GFS) – the business that delivers fund 
      administration, investment operations outsourcing and asset servicing 
      solutions to investment management firms across the globe.
    


      Cherecwich, who is based in Chicago, replaces Wilson Leech, who has been 
      named CEO for Northern Trust’s Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. 
      In addition to his new role leading the GFS group, Cherecwich will 
      maintain his responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer (COO) for 
      Northern Trust’s Corporate & Institutional Services division.
    

      In line with the group’s continuing growth, Northern Trust has created 
      three new regional roles within GFS. Toby Glaysher has been named 
      head of GFS for Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK; Jennifer Driscoll 
      has been appointed head of GFS for the Asia-Pacific region in addition 
      to COO for GFS, while Dan Houlihan will assume responsibility for 
      the Americas. Vic Holmes continues to be responsible for the 
      Channel Islands. All have experience working with Northern Trust’s GFS 
      clients, across the globe.
    

      “These roles have been created to support our increasing client base in 
      whichever time zone they are operating in, and is in line with our 
      global strategy for growth,” said Cherecwich. “As new regulations come 
      into effect in markets across the world, we are seeing an increasing 
      demand from our clients for solutions and services that can accommodate 
      their changing requirements. This new structure will ensure we are well 
      positioned to continue to support them, locally and globally.”
    

      Northern Trust’s Global Fund Services unit provides fund administration 
      and investment operations outsourcing solutions to more than 400 asset 
      managers across the globe. It supports multiple fund structures across 
      multiple domiciles and jurisdictions and has expertise in traditional 
      and alternative investment vehicles.
