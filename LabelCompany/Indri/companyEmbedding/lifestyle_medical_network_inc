 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Employment Agreement
On July 2, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved, an Employment Agreement (“Agreement”) with Christopher P. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer. The Agreement was effective July 1, 2017, for an initial term of three years, and the term is automatically extended for additional one year periods if neither party gives notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the initial term or any current additional one year term.
The Agreement with Mr. Smith (referred to sometimes as the “Executive”) provides for a base salary of $240,000 per year, and provides for incentive payments as established by the Board of Directors and for a performance bonus (“Performance Bonus”) based on the sum of two components, the first of which is as follows:


Net Operating Profit Before Income Taxes
Performance Bonus


On the First $10 Million
4.0% of Net Operating Profit


On all Amounts Over $10 Million
3.0% of Net Operating Profit 


The Agreement contains provisions for discharge for "cause", including breach of the Agreement or specified detrimental conduct by Mr. Smith, in which case accrued compensation would payable as provided in the Agreement. The Agreement also provide for termination by the Executive for “good reason”, comprising events such as breach of the Agreement by the Company, assignment of duties inconsistent with the Executive’s position, transfer of the Executive’s primary office by more than 25 miles from Lake Mary, Florida, or in the event of a change in control of the Company. In the event of a termination by the Company without cause, or by the Executive for “good reason”, the Company is required to pay to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days after the date of termination the aggregate of the following amounts:
A. the sum of (1) the Executive’s annual minimum salary through the date of termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) any annual incentive payment earned by the Executive for a prior period to the extent not theretofore paid and not theretofore deferred, (3) any annual performance bonus payment earned by the Executive for a prior period to the extent not theretofore paid and not theretofore deferred,(4) any accrued and unused vacation pay and (5) any business expenses incurred by the Executive that are unreimbursed as of the date of termination;
B. The product of (1) the performance bonus payment and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed in the fiscal year of the Company in which the date of termination occurs as of the date of termination, and the denominator of which is 365;
C. the amount equal to the sum of (1) the Executive’s annual minimum salary; (2) one (1) times the performance bonus payment and (3) one (1) times the incentive payment;
D. In the event Executive is not fully vested in any retirement benefits with the Company from pension, profit sharing or any other qualified or non-qualified retirement plan, the difference between the amounts Executive would have been paid if he had been vested on the date his employment was terminated and the amounts paid or owed to the Executive to such retirement plans;
E. The product of (1) the incentive payment and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed in the fiscal year of the Company in which the date of termination occurs as of the date of termination, and the denominator of which is 365; and
F. The present value of the amount equal to the sum of five (5) years’ Performance Bonus pay with such amount being calculated based on the Performance Bonus paid to the Employee the year prior to the date of termination.
In addition, all stock options and warrants outstanding as of the date of termination and held by the Executive shall vest in full and become immediately exercisable for the remainder of their full term; all restricted stock shall no longer be restricted to the extent permitted by law, and the Company will use its best efforts, at its sole cost to register such restricted stock as expeditiously as possible.
