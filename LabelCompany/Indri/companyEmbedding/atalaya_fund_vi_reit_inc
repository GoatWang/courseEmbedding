Atalaya Capital Closes Sixth Special Opportunities Fund At Hard Cap | Business Wire


























































Atalaya Capital Closes Sixth Special 
      Opportunities Fund At Hard Cap






April 13, 2016 10:52 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Atalaya Capital Management, a private credit asset manager, announced 
      today that it has closed its sixth Special Opportunities Fund (“Fund 
      VI”) at its $800 million hard cap, exceeding its $750 million target. 
      Fund VI is the fourth consecutive oversubscribed Atalaya Special 
      Opportunities Fund, representing an increase from its $575 million 
      predecessor, Fund V. Fund VI’s investors are predominantly public and 
      corporate pension plans, foundations, and endowments.
    

      Like previous Atalaya Opportunity Funds, Fund VI will invest primarily 
      in credit opportunities, the majority of which will be senior debt 
      collateralized by financial, real estate, or corporate assets. Targeted 
      investments include:
    


        Specialty finance loans against small balance assets such as consumer 
        and commercial credit or equipment leases;
      

        Performing, sub-performing, and non-performing real estate debt 
        opportunities and related financings; and
      

        Small and middle market corporate credit.
      


      “With Fund VI, we are excited to capitalize on our ten-year history of 
      sourcing and investing across the credit landscape. The long-term shift 
      away from traditional capital sources such as banks, combined with 
      recent credit market volatility, should produce even greater opportunity 
      for investors with patient and structurally appropriate capital like 
      Atalaya,” said Ivan Zinn, Atalaya’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Real Estate Investment Trusts: All about REITs, reit

REITs: A Way to Invest in 
		Commercial Real Estate


        Real estate investment trusts (REITs) enable individual investors to 
		participate in large-scale, income-producing real estate investments. 


        REITs are a special form of corporation 
        that, by law, must invest only in real estate. In return for following 
        that rule, a REIT does not have to pay U.S. federal income
        tax if it pays out at least 90% of its net income in the form of
        dividends to its shareholders (for the years 2009/2010, the IRS allowed 
        a REIT 
        to pay 90% of its dividends in stock rather than cash). 
To
        qualify as a REIT, a company must meet the following requirements:
�  its assets must consist
            mostly of real estate held for long-term investment,
�  its income must be
            mainly derived from real estate, and
�  it must pay out at least
            90% of its taxable income to shareholders.

Equity REITs vs. Mortgage REITs

There
        are two major categories of REITs. Equity REITs own physical properties
        such as apartment houses or shopping centers. By contrast, mortgage
        REITs do not own real estate properties, instead, they invest in
        mortgages. Equity REITs may invest in any type of real estate, but most
        specialize in a particular property type. 
REITs: Pay 
		Attention to Funds From Operations (FFO) 

		When analyzing REITs, you need to know that that taxable income 
        is not necessarily the same as the net income shown in the quarterly or 
        annual financial statements. In fact, most REITs do not disclose their 
		taxable income reported to the IRS. 

		Actually, when it comes to analyzing a REIT's ability to pay dividends, 
		neither taxable income or financial statement net income means much. 

		That's because, in both instances, real estate property owners 
        must deduct non-cash depreciation expenses when they calculate income, even if the property is, in 
        fact, appreciating in value. Thus, neither the taxable income nor the 
		financial state numbers tell you anything about the cash available to 
		pay dividends. 
For that reason, the REIT trade association created a 
        measure called funds from operations (FFO), which reflects the actual cash 
        profits generated by a property REIT's operations. Almost all property 
		REITs include the funds from operations numbers in their quarterly 
		reports. 
More About 
		REITs 

		No matter how you count it, the federal rules require REITs to pay 
        out a large chunk of earnings to shareholders, leaving little to fund 
		expansion. Thus REITs must 
        raise capital by borrowing or by selling more shares to fund growth. 

        Property REITs are allowed to provide the customary management services 
        associated with leasing properties such as apartment buildings, shopping 
        centers and office buildings. But REITs are not allowed to operate real 
        estate that requires a high degree of personal service such as hotels 
        and healthcare facilities. However, property REITs
        can create affiliated companies that can provide management services. in
        these sectors.

REIT Categories
We have divided the 
		REIT universe into eleven categories:



Retail:
shopping centers, outlet centers, small neighborhood centers, or
            downtown/heavily trafficked retail locations. 


Healthcare:
            owners, but not operators, of healthcare facilities such as nursing
            homes, medical office buildings, hospitals, etc.


Lodging:
            hotels, motels, and resort properties. Since Lodging REITs are not allowed to
            directly manage their hotel operations, most hire nationally known 
			hotel operators such as Marriot or Westin to run their properties. 
			Those properties bear the name of the management company, not the 
			property owner. 


Industrial:
            industrial, warehouse, distribution center, or flex properties. Flex
            properties, a recent innovation,
            are single-story buildings that could be configured as needed to be 
			used as office, light
            manufacturing and/or warehouse space. 


Office:
            office buildings are generally categorized as Class A, Class B, or
            Class C, depending on amenities and location. Class A, typically 
			located in downtown or upscale areas, are the
            best. Class B buildings are usually in suburban neighborhoods. Class
            C buildings are typically older and in low-rent areas.


Mixed
            Industrial/Office: these REITs own both office and
            industrial/warehouse properties.


Mortgage/Finance:
            REITs that invest in existing mortgages, or offer new mortgages or
            other types of financing.


Residential:
            apartment and manufactured home community owners.


Digital 
			Infrastructure: 

			Computer data centers, telecomm towers operators, and communications 
			networks.


Specialty:
            self-storage centers, restaurant property owners, and other REITs
            that do not fit into the major categories.


Diversified:
            REITs that own properties in multiple categories.


REIT Income Tax Considerations

REIT dividends are mostly taxed at ordinary income tax rates. However, 
        after the year-end, a REIT may designate a portion of its prior year's 
        payouts as "qualified dividends," which qualify for the maximum 15%/20% 
        rate.  On average, roughly 20% of annual payouts fall into this 
        category. A REIT may also classify portions of its prior year payouts as 
        return of capital. Return of capital payouts 
        reduce your cost basis and are not taxable until you sell your REIT 
        shares, when they are taxed at the appropriate capital gains rate.

Preferred Stocks 
Primer  
 

While money market funds are paying 
		next to nothing, 
		many preferred stocks
		are paying 5% to 8%.  



Preferred Stocks Basics 

Corporations issue preferred stocks to raise cash. 
		Although you buy or sell them the same way you trade regular stocks, 
		preferreds are more like bonds than common stocks. Investors buy them 
		for the steady dividends, which typically equate to 4% to 8% yields. 
		Most preferreds pay dividends quarterly.  

Unlike common stocks, you�re won�t enjoy much share price 
		appreciation if your company comes up with a hot product. Further, in 
		most cases, the dividend never goes up either.

        The term �preferred� means that a firm must pay the dividends due on its 
        preferred shares before it pays any common stock dividends. 
        Also, in theory, if a company goes bankrupt, preferred holders have 
        priority over common stock shareholders. However, when a company fails, 
        both common and preferred shareholders usually get nothing. 

        Finally, another meaningless distinction: unlike common stock holders, 
        preferred shareholders don�t get to vote on company proposals. But, in 
        fact, individual common shareholders have almost no influence on any 
        corporation's policies. 

Preferred Stocks: What You Need to Know

        When a company issues a preferred stock, it sets the annual dividend and 
        sells the shares at a preset price, typically $25, but some are also  issued 
        at $10, $50 or $100. 

        The initial yield, called the �coupon rate,� is the annual dividend 
        divided by the issue price. For instance, the yield on shares paying 
        $1/year on shares issued at $25 is 4%. 

        However, since preferreds trade on the open market just like 
        regular stocks, the actual trading price depends on supply and demand. 
        Thus, if the shares mentioned above slip to $24, the yield to new 
        investors (market yield) rises to 4.2% ($1 divided by $24).  

Preferred Stock Ticker Symbols

        Companies that issue preferred stocks typically sell more than one 
        series, for instance, Series A, Series B, etc. Ticker symbols are not 
		standardized and vary from site to site. However they typically start 
		with the issuer's common stock symbol and end with the series 
		designator. For instance, the ticker for Bank of America (BAC) Series N 
		preferreds might be BAC-N, BAC-PN, BACPRN, etc. To find the ticker on a 
		particular site, use the symbol lookup function and enter the common 
		stock ticker. Most sites respond with a list of all tickers starting 
		with those letters. From that list, find the ticker ending with the 
		desired series designator. After you've done it once, you'll probably be 
		able to find additional preferreds on the same site without needing the 
		lookup function.

Calling Preferreds

        Preferreds have minimum 30-year maturities and some are perpetual, 
        meaning that the firm is not obligated to redeem them. However, most 
        preferred stocks are �callable,� meaning that the issuer has the right 
        to call (redeem) them at the �call price� after a specified date (call 
        date), typically five-years after issue. The call price is usually as the 
        original issue price, but in some instances is slightly 
        higher. 

        The issuer is not obligated to redeem the shares at the call 
        date. Issuers are likely to call their preferreds if interest rates have 
        dropped and they can save money by calling existing preferreds and 
        selling a new batch paying lower rates. Thus, depending on prevailing 
        interest rates, preferreds might continue to trade for years after the 
        call date.

Preferred Stock Returns

Preferred Stock Dividend Yield

        A preferred stock's coupon rate defines its annual dividend, but not the yield 
        that you would receive if you bought the preferreds after the issue 
        date. For instance, A 7.0% bond issued at $25 pays $1.75/share annually 
        (7% of $25). If the price drops and you only pay $23.00 per share, your 
        nominal yield would be 7.6% ($1.75 divided by $23). On the other hand,  
        your yield would drop to 6.7% if you pay $26 for the shares, which still 
        might be acceptable, depending on what banks are paying at the time. 

Preferred Stock Yield to Call   

        For preferreds near or already past their call dates, it�s important to 
        know your potential return should they be called. For instance, say that 
        you pay $26 per share for 7.0% (coupon rate) preferreds originally 
        issued at $25 per share that can be called in 12-months.  Even 
        though you're collecting a nominal 6.7% yield, you would lose $1/share 
        in 12-months if the shares were called at that time. Factoring that in, 
        your actual return, called the "yield to call," would drop to 2.9%. 
        Rather than doing the math yourself, use this
        
        handy calculator to determine your preferred's yield to call. 

Potential Price Appreciation

        Ideally, you would like to buy preferreds below their issue 
        price. Assuming that the issuing corporation is a solid player and won't 
        renege on its dividend obligations, the preferreds will eventually move 
        back up to their issue price. If that happens, you would enjoy capital 
        appreciation in addition to the dividends. For instance, suppose that 
        you buy shares originally issued at $25, but currently trading at $23. 
        Your capital appreciation potential is 8.7%., and your nominal dividend 
        yield is 7.6%. 

        Obviously, thanks to the capital appreciation potential, the call date 
        isn't an issue when you buy preferreds trading below their call price. 
        For example, for the 7.0% coupon preferreds trading at $23, your yield 
        to maturity would be 16.3% if they were called 12-months after you 
        purchased. In practice, though, most companies wouldn't call preferreds 
		trading significantly below their call prices. Instead, they would 
		simply buy them on the open market if they wanted to redeem them.




        Preferred 

        Stock 

		Risks 


        Preferred stock investors face three major risk factors: 1) dividend 
        suspension or company failure, 2) rising interest rates, and 3) low 
        trading volumes.  

Preferred Dividend Suspension/Company Failure

        Firms that are facing cash flow problems will be tempted to suspend 
        paying preferred stock dividends, and in the worst case, might file for 
        bankruptcy. Either of those events would sink preferred share prices. 

        Consequently, preferred investors must understand the issuing 
        corporation's fundamental outlook. Preferreds issued by marginal 
        corporations will look tempting because they will be 
        trading at big discounts to their issue price. Thus, be sure to do your 
        homework before buying preferreds in that category. 

        Many preferred stocks are rated by bond rating agencies such as Moody's and 
        Standard & Poor's. They use a combination of letters, numbers, and plus 
        or minus signs such as AAA, BA1 or B- to rate the preferreds.
        The details vary between agencies, but all ratings starting with A, and 
        three letter ratings starting with B, indicate investment quality. 

S&P: 
          Investment quality ratings are AAA, AA, A, and BBB. Below investment 
          quality ( best to worst) are BB, 
        B, CCC, CC, C and D. S&P may add a �+� or �-� to indicate 
        that a rating falls near the top or bottom of a rating category. 
Moody�s 
          investment quality ratings, are Aaa, Aa, A, and Baa. Below investment 
          quality (best to worst) are Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C. Moody�s may add a �1,� �2,� or �3� to a rating 
        to indicate that it falls near the top or bottom of a rating category (1 
        is best). 


        Since issuers must pay Moody�s or S&P to be rated, not all preferreds 
        are rated. Unrated preferreds aren�t necessarily risky, but they require 
        more work since you�ll have to do the financial strength analysis on 
        your own. 

        Beware; bond-analysts sometimes overlook the obvious. For instance, in 
        2007, many didn�t realize that falling home prices would 
        reduce the value of mortgages secured by those homes. Thus, it�s up to 
        you to keep up with the news and avoid industries with obvious problems.
        

Preferred Interest Rate Risk

        After the issuing company's financial outlook, prevailing interest rates are the most important factor controlling 
        preferred share prices. If market rates rise, preferred stock prices will 
        probably drop, and vice versa. Here�s why.

        Suppose that you own preferreds paying an initial 6% dividend yield; for 
        instance, a preferred issued at $25 that pays dividends totaling $1.50 
        annually. Now, say that prevailing corporate rates rise to 7%. There 
        would be no market for preferreds paying 6% at $25 per share. Instead, 
        buyers would only be willing pay $21.43 per share. At that price, the 
        $1.50 annual dividend would equate to a 7% return ($1.50 divided by 
        $21.43 is 7%). 

        Conversely, if interest rates drop, investors would be willing to pay 
        more for you shares because they are yielding better than market 
        returns. Thus, the best time to own preferreds is when the outlook for 
        corporate 
        interest rates is steady or headed down. 

Trading Volumes

        Some preferred stocks are not widely followed and are lightly traded. 
        Those are risky business because the lack of trading volume makes it 
        difficult to move in or out of a position at a reasonable price. Avoid 
        preferred stocks trading less than 4,000 shares daily, on average. 


Preferred 
Stock 
Tax 
Issues
 

        For reasons too involved to detail here, the dividends from some 
        preferreds are subject to the maximum 15%/20% dividend tax rate, while 
        others are taxed as ordinary income. That can make a big difference. For 
        instance, $1.00 of dividends taxed at 15% nets out to roughly the same 
        amount as $1.30 taxed at the maximum 35% ordinary tax rate. For each 
        preferred, Quantum Online (www.quantumonline.com) 
        specifies whether the 15%/20% maximum rate applies. 

        Corporations that have invested in other firm�s preferred shares, in 
        most instances, enjoy a dividend received deduction that allows them to 
        exclude 70% of dividends received from their taxable income. Quantum 
        Online also specifies whether each preferred qualifies for the corporate 
        dividend received deduction.
        

How
        To

		Evaluate 

		Preferred 
        
        Stocks

        Evaluate preferreds by analyzing the issuing company�s financial 
        strength. What�s important is that the firm has the cash to pay its 
        dividends. It doesn�t matter if the issuer�s earnings came in below 
        analysts� estimates or it said next quarter sales would be lower than 
        previously forecast. 
Here 
        are some selection criteria to keep in mind.
�  
		Current Price vs. Call Price: ideally, the current preferred trading 
		price would be below the call price, and should never be more than 15% 
		above the call price. 
�  
        Credit Rating: conservative investors should stick with investment grade (any rating starting with "A" 
        and three-letter "B" ratings).
�  
        Trading Volume: minimum 4,000 shares, traded daily, on average.
�  
		Issuers common stock trading price: minimum $5 and higher is better. 
�  
        Issuing Company Analyst Consensus Buy/Sell Rating: hold or better. 
�  
        Issuing Company Return on Assets: 6% or higher. 
�  
        Issuing Company trailing 12-months (TTM) Operating Cash Flow: positive.

Preferred 
Stock 
Glossary

Adjustable Rate: annual dividend varies depending on predefined 
        factors. 

Baby Bonds: same as Senior Notes (see below). 

Callable: issuer has the right to redeem shares at issue price 
        after a specified date. 

Call Date: earliest date that shares can be called. Usually five 
        years after issue date. 

Call Price: price issuer will pay for redeemed shares. Usually 
        the same as the issue price. 

Convertible: holders have the right to convert preferred shares 
        to common stock at predetermined ratio after specified date. This gives 
        preferred holders a chance to benefit from the common stock�s share 
        price appreciation. 

Coupon Rate: yield based on initial issue price 

Cumulative: skipped dividends must still be paid before common 
        stock dividends are paid and before the shares are redeemed. 

Current Yield: yield based on current share price.

CUSIP: unique identifier for each security. 

Exchange-Traded Debt Securities: a.k.a. Preferred Equity Traded 
        (PET) Bonds or Junior Subordinated Debentures. Debt securities such as 
        debentures, notes and bonds that trade like stocks. These unsecured debt 
        instruments rank below secured debt, but senior to preferred and common 
        stocks. 

Ex-Dividend Date: you must purchase shares prior to the 
        ex-dividend date to receive the corresponding payout. 

Issue Price: original share price. 

Liquidation Value: same as issue price. 

Market Yield: same as current yield. 

Maturity Date: the date the preferred shares must be redeemed by 
        the issuing firm, typically 30 to 100 years after issue. 

Non-Cumulative: depending on the preferred, skipped dividends can 
		be delayed for five-years, or even indefinitely.  Unlike failing to 
		pay required bond interest payments, preferred issuers are not "in 
		default" if they skip preferred dividends. 

        However, skipped 
		dividends must still be paid before common stock dividends are paid and 
		before the shares are redeemed. 

Par Value: same as issue price 

Participating: annual dividend varies depending on firm�s net 
        income or dividends paid to common shareholders. 

PINES (Public Income Notes): a.k.a. QUIBS (Quarterly Interest 
        Bonds) or QUIDS (Quarterly Income Debt Securities). Debt securities such 
        as debentures, notes and bonds that trade like stocks. These senior 
        unsecured debt instruments rank below secured debt, but senior to 
        preferred and common stocks. 

Redeemable: same as �callable.� 

Redemption Date: same as call date. 

Senior Notes: Issuers cannot skip preferred interest payments 
		(dividends) without going into default. 

Third Party Trust Preferred: a Trust Preferred issued by a third 
        party such as an underwriter. 

Trust Preferred Securities: a cumulative preferred variation that provides certain 
        income tax and accounting advantages over traditional preferreds to the 
        issuer, but not for the shareholder. Instead of selling preferreds 
        directly, a corporation sets up a special trust that buys debt 
        securities from the corporation and, in turn, issues preferred shares. If the issuer suspends dividends, shareholders may still be 
        liable for income taxes on the unpaid dividends. TruPS - Trust Preferred 
        Securities are Smith Barney's brand name for Trust Preferreds. 
        TOPrS - Trust Originated Preferred Securities are Merrill Lynch's 
        brand name for Trust Preferreds. 

Yield to Call: return you would receive assuming the preferred is 
        redeemed on the call date.
Yield to Maturity: return you would receive assuming the 
        preferred is redeemed on its maturity date.

Dividend Capture, ex-dividend dates











 






 


























Dividend Capture
      Strategies





Want to capture 
				dividends?  Dividend Detective has the tools you need.  

Click 
				
here to subscribe.  











Did you know that you only have to 
		hold a stock for one day to collect a dividend? That fact has inspired 
		many investors to pursue �dividend capture� strategies that involve 
		holding a stock just long enough to collect the dividend, selling at or 
		above their purchase price, and then moving on. 
 

Of course, it�s not that easy. For 
		starters, theoretically, the share price drops by the dividend amount on 
		the ex-dividend date. But, in fact, many different factors influence a 
		stock�s price movements on any given day, and prices typically don�t 
		drop by the exact dividend amount on the ex-date.  

Dividend Capture Definitions 


Here 
		are definitions that you need to know. 

Declaration date: the day that a firm announces its next dividend. 
      Such announcements are almost always made via a press release.  

Owner of Record date: the date that you must be registered as a shareholder 
      to collect the next dividend. You become the owner of record on the third 
		business day after you purchased the shares.  

Ex-dividend date: the first day that new buyers are not 
		entitled to collect the next dividend. The ex-dividend date is 

        two business days before the "owner of record" date 
        (business days are days when New York City banks are open, not 
      stock market days). In the case of very large dividends (at least 25% 
      of the share price), to collect the dividend, you cannot sell until at 
		least one market day after the 
      payment date.  

Payment date: the day that the dividend should be deposited into 
      your brokerage account.  

Thus, in most instances, you could purchase shares on the 
		day prior to the ex-dividend date, sell on the ex-dividend date, and still collect the dividend on the payment date.  

Traditional Dividend Capture Strategies

Traditional dividend capture strategies involve buying a stock before the ex-dividend date, 
		thus qualifying to collect the dividend, and then selling some time 
		later.  

Within that general framework, traditional dividend capture players 
		employ a variety of sub-strategies. Some try to buy before the dividend is announced, some 
			sell on the ex-date, while others wait for a stock to recover to a 
			predetermined price before selling. Dividend capture is a 
			controversial topic and not everybody believes that any capture 
			strategy will be consistently profitable.  

Dividend Capture Income Tax Implications

U.S. tax rules say that you must hold a stock a least 61 days to be 
      eligible for the maximum 15%/20% dividend tax rate. Consequently, some 
		dividend capture investors try to hold for that period before selling. 
		Alas, such strategies are generally unproductive. For starters, doing so would limit you to six 
      trades per year. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that your trade 
		would remain profitable after waiting that long.  

You can mitigate 
		these issues by limiting your dividend capture trades to tax-sheltered 
		accounts such as IRAs or Roth IRAs. If held in an ordinary IRA, 

dividends aren't taxed until you begin taking 
		distributions from that IRA. If held in a ROTH IRA, dividends are not 
		taxed at all.

Special Dividend Resources
Special dividends are one-time payouts that that are often 
		much larger than regular dividends. For instance, regular quarterly 
		dividends typically amount to around 1% of a stock�s trading price 
		compared to 3% or 4%, and sometimes much higher, for special 
		dividends. Those higher yields can translate to better profit 
		opportunities than regular dividends. D.D. Premium's Special Dividend 
		report lists all upcoming special dividends that we've evaluated as 
		investable, plus our recommended Special Dividend Trading Strategy. If you're already a Premium member, here's a link 
      to that report.  If not click here
