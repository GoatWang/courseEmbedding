Albert Henry "Woody" Woodfull (17 September 1912 – 24 June 2011) was an English product designer. Laying down many of the ground rules of industrial design in plastics while heading British Industrial Plastics' Product Design Unit,[1] his work had international influence.[2]
Woodfull was born in Birmingham and trained as a silversmith at the Vittoria Street School of Jewellery and Silversmithing before studying product design at the Birmingham School of Art.[3] In 1934 he was appointed to British Industrial Plastics (BIP) as a product designer at their Streetly factory. His brief from the managing director was to "bring art to an artless industry", and his early work was largely in packaging,[4] where designs such as his Ardath Cigarette Box of 1935 showed strong Art Deco influences and have become highly collectable.[5]
After World War II he produced notable promotional material for Cadbury's,[6] but increasingly focussed on tableware, designing the classic Beetleware range in urea formaldehyde in 1946.[7]
Woodfull visited the United States in 1948 to investigate the newly developed melamine formaldehyde material, whose greater water resistance was to lead it briefly to threaten ceramics as the dominant material in tableware.[8]
In 1951 Woodfull was appointed to head BIP's newly formed Product Design Unit, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1970. As well as developing designs for BIP itself, the unit's Design Advisory Service aimed to provide design consultancy to companies developing products in plastics, with the aim of improving the public's perception of the quality of plastic products and increasing demand for BIP's materials.[4] As a result, Woodfull and the team he built up were responsible to some degree for most of the designs for tableware in melamine that developed in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Gaydon and Melaware ranges that are now recognised as being among the pinnacles of 1960s plastics design.[8]

 " DISCOVER HOW To Be Part Of Nigeria's Lucrative Multi-Million Naira  Foodstuff Export Market With Over '30' Exportable Foodstuffs You Can Export to Foreign Countries"Monday, June 19th, 2017
Over 400 Nigerian African food supermarket and Grocery store all over Europe including U.S, Waiting for you to become their supplier on a monthly bases and make well over 110% in return. The opportunity in export business is super massive...Ask any major player in this business. Not only for those already in the export business, but even for the new comers.To commenceÂ foodstuff business on a small scale..If you  are here by links from google search, facebook, online comment or someone recommend this life changer webpage to you, please consider yourself out of poverty level..   Because by the time you are done reading the whole of this page and some of the recommendation I will be referring to...You will be grounded with power to destroy poverty for life, you have my word!! I searched for results !I  attended as many seminars, bought lots of off-line and online materials, but non worked for me. I kept on taking risk, spent my hard earn money on seminars, unit I attended one very last seminar where I was taught, how to export three easy products with very little amount of money.   I digged harder for resultAt first it was not easy for me to understand but with devauting more time on my computer and the source provided for me I finally got :   How to,    What to and   Where to.Solution Solved!In addition to that,I developed my own strategy which earned me my first 2 Buyer in 2 days. Since then I have being using my own strategies to crack where buyers, client or customers are located.I Repeated same process again and again... If You Follow All  My Instructions, These Will Happen:Total financial freedom to youYou be your own boss in no timeYou live the life style of your dreamYou control your baseYou control time You start building your businessYou have more time for family and friendsYou will no more wake up 4am to fight to get to work on time No more 8am - 5pm slavery Job Little Intro About Me ...I`m Albert Henry and I been making a great living through Exportation of Agro produce EXPORTATION business Products since 2009.Since those early days I`ve gone on to make silence income from Naira to dollars , pound , Euros and even became #1 Exporter among The best of the best in this great Country (Nigeria). I`ve also taught hundreds of people how to truly make a lot of income through Export of Agriculture produce. Which they still do till date. I kept getting positive messages on a daily basics. Testimonies HereAnd yes, I can show you my nice big dream house, my fancy sports cars, and all the checks that I make each and every month from past clients. But would much rather show you exactly what I did to get all of those things.I`ve already been doing well with this for years now.  I`ve been in the trenches for so long I know what it takes to make a great living from the export deals.That`s why I`d love to show you how I`ve achieved all of my success so you can simply copy my ways of ruining small scale export of agro produce.Since I started teaching over 5 years ago and after helping hundreds of people make full time income from Exporting, in their spare time I still get asked how it`s done on a daily bases.  The opportunity in export business is super massive...Ask any major player in this business.These write up is not only for those already in the export business, but even for the new comers.To commence foodstuff business on a small scale.Company registration is optional since you are doing it on a small scale, which means you are sending the foodstuff items through the help of courier companies... e.g,    EMX , NIPOST  UPS and the rest. But, if you are on a tight budject and want to send large quantities  from 1/tons you can use the services of freight forwarders at NARCO Nig. which is extremely cheap.The requirements include start up capital of betweenN100,000 and N150,000an e-mail,a mobile phone andan account with a reputable bank here in Nigeria.However, having a domiciliary account is better. You don’t need previous experience in the field but you should have a “Good Head” for organizing and negotiation. You can get support from an organization called Association of Micro-Entrepreneurs of Nigeria (AMEN), to allow you to get NAFDAC number. Only if the product need customized attention. Note :  Only for customized products.The volume of Nigerian exporters of foodstuff to those countries are still on a very low level.... Considering the estimated 20 million people of Nigerian residing outside the country, with the majority living in the United Kingdom (UK) and the US.  I learnt Malazia as taken over ...   This is a great opportunity to sell to this category of people. The few exporters of African foodstuff cannot meet with the demand of Nigerians which populations are increasing everyday in the US and UK.  I know that you’re more than tired of hearing bold claims and empty promises from shady people who only want to take your money and run away.  It’s clear that you have had enough of this.But today I can promise you that if you keep reading, you will find a few surprises that are going to positively affect your overall life…And this is no exaggeration – it can truly happen if you stick here with me and pay close attention to what I have to say to you.But first, before we get into the juicy details, here’s some advice…Listen, there’s something that clearly is not working for you.You’re not making the kind of money that will make a difference in your life. And although it’s not your fault, there are a few things that you need to stop doing in order to head toward the path of success.My first suggestion is that you STOP buying course after course after course.Stop believing the lies of many unscrupulous marketers who only want to have you on their list so they can spam you to death with new promotions every day. They did it to me back then. It’s just about time to end this nonsense.Let Dive Into Real Business NowTo start an export business, money is not the most important thing; but it will play a fast role ... you need to have the knowledge and the right idea and the market needed. There is assistance to any Nigerian with the right will power. What you need to succeed are: Integrity, Honesty and Diligence.A lot of Nigerian are operating a highly lucrative home-based export company and they are constantly making a steady income of between #150,000 and #2,000,000 monthly, and regularly.   With no capital investment, no risk and at their spare time. The profit from the first transaction can be ploughed back and an investor can be able to build up his capital base. To start this business, all you need to have on standby are :Mobile phoneBank account {saving or current}E-mail addressInternet/cyber caféUnderstanding of an export business process (Starter Kits)The determination and the desire to make it successful.Between #50,000 and #150,000 COMMODITIES YOU CAN PACKAGE FOR EXPORT TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND MAKE COOL PROFIT PER ONE “GHANA-MUST-GO” BAG.Honey :-  Honey is currently priced between US$19.00 to US$23.10 per kilogram in the international market. In the Nigeria market, genuine and pure honey costs #300 to #600 per kg. Needless to emphasis that the business is highly profitable considering our naira exchange to US$ dollar, which is currently around US$1 to between #320 & #420. As at 15th of May 2017....The most important thing is to know when to go and harvest. And usually, harvest is between 10 to 12 months after set up. Honey can also be bought from local sellers to make huge profit locally and internationally.     SHEA BUTTER:Shea butter is highly valued commodity among the world’s cosmetic companies, and as its demand has grown, so also its potential for exploitation and exportation.Statistics shows that only 25% to 30% of the Shea nuts produced in Nigeria wild are collected. Apart from its role as an important raw material, Shea butter is used in the manufacturing of chocolate and other confectionaries. It is also used in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. These product are not only needed in Europe but are highly priced in Nigeria which in fact, currently import them from abroad. The price of Shea nut FOB {Lagos} is about $820/MT.

UK Department for International Development programme has revealed that massive potential exists for the export of Ofada rice to Europe and USA. There are about 740,000 Nigerian living in UK and a potential demand for about 150 tonnes of Ofada rice. The fast food companies in Nigeria are hungry of Ofada. The market in the US, however seems to have an even greater potential for growth than the one in the UK. You can package it in 1kg or 2kg bag like that old Uncle Ben’s rice. You can get the NAFDAC approval through the Association of Micro Enterprise of Nigeria {AMEN} or visit NARDAC Office across the Nation.   PALM KERNEL SHELL: Palm kernel shell is the housing of palm kernel seed. Palm kernel shells have very low ash and sulphur contents. The specification is 20% max of moisture; 3% max of fiber and dirt. The price at the international market is from $1100 to $1400 per ton. Some Nigerians throw away this product without knowing that it is a product which is in high demand at the international market. The local price is from #600 to #800/MT and {30tons} per trailer load while you will have to package to buyers specification. Palm kernel shell can be located in, Ondo, Osun, Ogun, and some other south western part of Nigeria. Though, it can also be found in some states in the eastern part of Nigeria.  GARRI: Garri is a fine or coarse granular flour of varying texture made from cassava tubers {also called cassava root}, which are clean after harvesting, grated, with water and starch squeezed out of it, left to ferment and then fried either in palm oil or without palm oil and serve as a major staple food in west Africa. You can package in 1kg or 2kg bag and penetrate the local or foreign market. It is estimated that 20 million people of Nigerian descent reside outside Nigeria, with the majority lived in the United Kingdom and the United States. This is a great opportunity to sell to this category of people. Garri can be found in most of the states in the federation.  1 $ currently is btw #320 & #420. As at 15th of June 2017....Take advantage of this as smart people are making it.   SMOKED FISH:The fish is treated with salt, either in form of strong brine or a surface coating of dry salt.

POULTRY FARMING GUIDE























 






 

The high demand for chicken meat and eggs has really proven that Poultry farming in Nigeria is indeed a very lucrative business. The business of rearing of chicken and producing eggs for sale has created an opportunity for some young graduates,retired civil servants and others to earn regular income and also provide employment for countless number of Nigerians.... 
The major buyers of Chicken meat and eggs in the country are fast-food companies like,
 Mr. Biggs, 
Tantalizer, 
Tasty-Fried Chicken,
  UAC,
Followed by Hotels,
Restaurants and then the various house hold nationwide.
 
Though in recent time there has been an increase in the number of poultry farms been setup in various parts of Nigeria.
But I have discovered that there is still a short fall in the supply of chicken meat and eggs in the country.... 
 
A visit to any of the major markets will reveal to you that frozen chicken is still been smuggled by some traders into Nigeria from neighboring countries like the republic of Benin. 
The reason why this trend is prevalent is because most of the poultry farms in Nigeria operates on a small scale and can’t meet up with the increasing daily demand for chicken meat and eggs. 
So, if you are desirous of earning regular income with peace of mind, 
Then investing in commercial poultry is the wisest business decision you can ever make. 
Poultry farm (small or large scale) is not a business you invest into today and then wait till the next five before you start making profit. 
No...
It is a business you invest into day and then in the next 8-weeks you are smiling to the bank with your profit. 
Rearing of chicken and producing eggs for sale can take away poverty from your dictionary forever!
The two types of poultry systems are :
Battery cage system and 
The deep litter system. 
The battery cage system of rearing chicken involves putting your birds in cage.
 
 
 
 
While the deep litter system involves rearing the chicken on the floor covered with saw duct.
 
 
 
 
 
Though the battery cage system has some advantages, it helps to keep your birds from coming in contact with their droppings that may cause infection, but it is capital intensive.
 
 
The deep litter system does not require huge capital to set up your poultry farm business.
 
 
You can actually start a small scale a poultry farm deep litter system in that plot of land of yours by rearing 500-broilers from day chicks to an 8-weeks period where you sell them btw N1k-N2k each.
 
 
The initial cost of starting a small scale poultry farm of about 500broilers (deep litter system) is about N500K.... 
 
The Amount Stated Above Covers The Cost Of 
 purchasing a plot of land, 
  building structures that will house your chicken, 

   buying of some basic equipment,
  Daily feeding and
  Medical treatment.

Sourcing for funds to finance your small scale poultry farm business shouldn’t be a difficult thing; you can approach any commercial bank in Nigeria. 
Alternatively, if you have your own plot of land that alone has already reduced the amount of funds you will need to start drastically.
 
And the remaining amount you can be sourced through personal savings, loan from friends, relatives or co-operative. Assuming a mortality rate of 5% you are sure to make a profit margin of about N234, 325 at the end of the 8-weeks and if you repeat process say for like 3times or more, you stand to make millions as profit yearly. 
I believe, through this article you have discovered the profitability in poultry farm business and you are ready to give it a shot. 
Therefore, to assist serious investors like you achieve their desires of owning a business they can exercise full control over and also earn regular income with peace of mind. 
I have decided to package a comprehensive feasibility studies for a fee and it is for those who are really interested in setting up a small scale poultry business of their own.

Reasons to Start Your Own Poultry Farm Today


Poultry Farming business is probably one of the most profitable and beneficial farming business around.
Gone are the days when poultry farming is only for the poor, when chicken is only adopted and kept in the backyard by the poor commodities living in the rural slums or villages.


The huge potential in this business was still untapped until recently when competent businessmen realized benefit of poultry farming and got attracted towards it. Today, commercial Poultry farming has become one of the biggest agricultural business worldwide because people prefers white meat more to the red meat.



Poultry farming business is still heavily untapped in Nigeria as more than 80% of our daily consumption is said to be imported from another countries. Now, imagine the profit potential of supplying chicken and chicken products to over 80% of Nigerians?
 


Come to think of the fact that there are multiple ways of making money from poultry business.
 

The Eggs - Egg is a good source of low-cost high-quality protein, providing 6.3 grams of protein (13% of the daily value for protein) in one egg for a caloric cost of only 68 calories. The structure of humans and animals is built on protein. We rely on animal and vegetable protein for our supply of amino acids, and then our bodies rearrange the nitrogen to create the pattern of amino acids we require. Everyone needs at least two eggs daily.
 

These put the production and supply of chicken eggs in a very high demand. A create of egg is currently sold around N800, (as at the  time of written this report) MULTIPLY that to how many creates you produce! 
 
Day Old Chick - Raising day old chicks in Nigeria has become very popular because you only need a viable batch of eggs for hatching, a reliable incubator and a working knowledge of poultry incubation.

Also selling day old chicks can be done locally as thousands of poultry farmers are looking for it everyday. Your hatchery could be just what people in your community needed as a nearby source of day old chicks.
 
Many people would like to raise chickens themselves, rather than to buy pullets but are unable to get or hatch enough day old chicks. One is sold at approximately N200.
 
The Chicken - You don't need to be told about this, chicken meat is currently commands the highest demand in the market. If you have it, you have all the money in the world.
 
So, how much is the cost of this feasibility studies and the e-manual start up guide and with some other un-announced bonus?... 
Is the cost N30, 000?
Is the cost N25, 000?
Is the cost N20, 000?
Is the cost N15, 000?
Is the cost N10, 000?
The answer is capital NO!...
I should be charging you the amount listed above because I know that if I choose to sell it at that amount some people will still place order for the feasibility studies and the e-maunal.
 
 
But I won’t charge you too much for the feasibility studies & e-manual because I want to help you so you too can start earning regular income.

MUSIC







THE LONELY BULL















												
											
											
												THE LONELY BULL
												Original Release Date: 1962
Re-issue Date: 2015
The colossus that is A&M Records starts right here with the first album by the 1960s instrumental juggernaut known as the Tijuana Brass. True, there was no “Tijuana Brass” per se at this time; just Herb Alpert and a coterie of Los Angeles sessionmen, with Alpert overdubbing himself on trumpet to get that bullring effect. Also, Alpert was just getting the TJB concept underway; the textures are leaner, the productions less polished, and the accent is more consciously on a Mexican mariachi ambience — the relatively square rhythms, the mandolins, the mournful, wistful siesta feeling — than the records down the road. The hit title track (originally a tune called “Twinkle Star”!) is a cleverly structured, exciting and haunting piece of record-making — and its composer, Sol Lake, becomes the charter member of Alpert‘s team of TJB tunesmiths with several more ethnic-flavored numbers. In accordance with the newly emerging bossa nova movement, Alpert does a nice, straightforward, authentic cover of “Desafinado,” even departing a bit from the tune with some spare jazz-inspired licks, and “Crawfish” pleasingly adapts the mariachi horn sound to a bossa beat.


											







VOLUME 2















												
											
											
												VOLUME 2
												Original Release Date: 1963
Re-issue Date: 2015
The follow-up LP to The Lonely Bull, in the great tradition of follow-ups, tries to duplicate its appeal right off the bat with another leadoff track featuring bullfight sounds and an authentic bullring tune, “The Great Manolete.” Alpert is beginning to expand his reach beyond Baja, California without losing the ambience of “The Lonely Bull,” sharpening his skills as a producer and exploring other moods and rhythms. In doing so, he comes up with the greatest stripper record this side of David Rose, “Swinger from Seville,” a mocking version of Leonard Bernstein‘s “America” to a lively guajira beat in a wild simulated nightclub, and covers of ’60s standards like “More” and “Spanish Harlem.” He also receives some more haunting contributions from Sol Lake, including the wistful “Winds of Barcelona” (later recorded by Wes Montgomery) and a marvelously produced, Spanish-tinged tone poem, “Marching Through Madrid.” Though released in 1963, this record didn’t really start selling until 1966, when TJB albums were monopolizing the upper reaches of the charts en masse.


											







SOUTH OF THE BORDER















												
											
											
												SOUTH OF THE BORDER
												Original Release Date: 1964
Re-issue Date: 2015
Herb Alpert was still using an array of SoCal studio all-stars as his Tijuana Brass when South of the Border (1964) began to restore the combo’s good name after the modest Herb Alpert’s Tijuana Brass, Vol. 2 (1963) failed to ignite a fire in listener’s ears. Alpert later commented that the Sol Lake composition “Mexican Shuffle” “opened a new door for me.” That passageway meant the loss of the Tijuana Brass‘ practically forced mariachi style and the rise of Alpert‘s approach in arranging familiar melodies in fresh, creative settings. Nowhere would this stylistic progression be as pronounced as in the horn-driven updates of several then-concurrent chart hits. For instance, the mod sonic wrinkle in “Girl from Ipanema” emits a darkness veiled in mystery, directly contrasting the light buoyancy of “Hello! Dolly” or the footloose feel of the Beatles‘ “All My Loving.” They seamlessly fit in with Sol Lake‘s “Salud, Amor y Dinero” and a cover of Julius Wechter‘s playful, midtempo “Up Cherry Street” — which Wechter‘s own Baja Marimba Band had just recorded for their 1964 self-titled debut. The ballads “I’ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face,” “Angelito,” and “Adios, Mi Corazon” provide contrasts with Alpert‘s sensitive scores never seeming maudlin or unnecessarily over the top. If the regal “El Presidente” sounds particularly familiar, it may well be due to Alpert‘s slight renovation of the “Winds of Barcelona” from the Tijuana Brass‘ previous effort, the less than impressive Herb Alpert’s Tijuana Brass, Vol. 2. It was renamed “El Presidente,” presumably to honor the then-recent memory of the slain U.S. leader John Fitzgerald Kennedy.


											







WHIPPED CREAM















												
											
											
												WHIPPED CREAM
												Original Release Date: 1965
Re-issue Date: 2015
Building upon South of the Border‘s (1964) Top Ten success, Herb Alpert dismissed the contingency of Los Angeles-based studio instrumental all-stars, which he had christened the Tijuana Brass. Because there was enough demand for live dates, just like a musical Gepetto, Alpert formed a real Tijuana Brass. The bandleader/trumpeter was joined by Tonni Kalash (trumpet), Robert Edmondson (trombone), Pat Senatore (bass), John Pisano (guitars), Lou Pagani (piano), and Nick Ceroli (drums). Ostensibly, the personnel wasn’t a primary consideration as Alpert and company had already begun making serious inroads on the pop music scene. Not bad, considering the market was being heavily infiltrated, if not practically dominated by the British Invasion. With Whipped Cream & Other Delights (1965), they would take that momentum to new heights — including three Grammy Awards alone for the update of the Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow-penned theme to Shelagh Delaney’s play of the same name, “A Taste of Honey.” The remainder of the material on the dozen-song album was chosen with food as the underlying thematic motif. Sol Lake — who provided Alpert “The Lonely Bull” and “Mexican Shuffle” returns, and this time he has custom-made the upbeat and, above all, catchy trio of “Green Peppers,” “Bittersweet Samba,” and “El Garbanzo.” Allen Toussaint‘s title composition “Whipped Cream” garnered significant attention, but not as a chart hit. Rather, it could be heard as bachelorettes were being introduced on ABC-TV’s The Dating Game. Early in the series run, additional Alpert offerings were also incorporated as incidental music: “Spanish Flea,” as the bachelors were being announced, “Lollipops and Roses,” when the lucky winners were being told where they would be spending their date, and both “Ladyfingers” and “Lemon Tree” were in rotation as contestants mulled over their answers. [After several poor analog-to-CD transfers in the ’80s and ’90s, Whipped Cream & Other Delights was reissued as part of Shout! Factory’s Herb Alpert Signature Series and boasts remarkably improved sound.]
 


											







GOING PLACES















												
											
											
												GOING PLACES
												Original Release Date: 1965
Re-issue Date: 2015
Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass were rolling right down the middle of the American pop scene like a locomotive in 1966 — and this album captures them at the peak of their exuberance. By now, there really was a live, touring edition of the Tijuana Brass, and there was an easily identifiable TJB sound, with its strummed Latin American guitars, twin trumpet leads, delicate marimba or vibes (played by Julius Wechter of Baja Marimba Band fame in the studio), and strong grooves rooted in Latin American music, jazz, and rock. Alpert‘s family of sidemen and composers were busy generating their own catchy hits, like Wechter‘s deadly, infectious “Spanish Flea,” and the tragically short-lived Ervan Coleman‘s wonderfully goofy “Tijuana Taxi.” The bossman’s trumpet could be joyous, mocking, and melancholy in turns, and his choices of tunes totally unpredictable; who else would dare juxtapose “The 3rd Man Theme,” “Walk, Don’t Run,” “I’m Getting Sentimental Over You,” and “Zorba the Greek” on one record? No other TJB record has as much unbuttoned fun and humor as this one — and not surprisingly, it spent six weeks at number one in 1966.


											







WHAT NOW MY LOVE















												
											
											
												WHAT NOW MY LOVE
												Original Release Date: 1966
Re-issue Date: 2015
With this album, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass settle into their hitmaking groove, the once strikingly eclectic elements of Dixieland, pop, rock, and mariachi becoming more smoothly integrated within Alpert‘s infectious “Ameriachi” blend. They sound more like a band; along with Alpert‘s now-indelibly stamped trumpet sound, you can recognize jazzman John Pisano‘s distinctive rhythm guitar, Lou Pagani‘s piano, the droll Bob Edmondson‘s dulcet trombone, etc. Pisano, who debuted as a composer on Going Places, comes up with a memorably whistleable song, “So What’s New,” and the rest of Alpert‘s songwriting brigade (Ervan Coleman, Julius Wechter, and Sol Lake) chime in with some lively, catchy tunes. There is also an assortment of pop, film, and Broadway standards of the day, all impeccably arranged by Alpert, whose production instincts grew sharper and surer with every release. The result is another highly entertaining hit LP, one that stayed at number one longer than any other Tijuana Brass album (nine weeks).


											







SRO















												
											
											
												SRO
												Original Release Date: 1966
Re-issue Date: 2015
By late 1966, it seemed as if every TV commercial and every pop arranger had latched onto the Herb Alpert “Ameriachi” sound — at which point the resourceful originator of that sound began to pare it down and loosen it up a bit. S.R.O. (Standing Room Only), referring to the Tijuana Brass’ string of sold-out concerts, is an accurate title, for this LP is about a seven-piece band loaded with experienced jazzers who groove and swing together to a greater degree than on their previous albums. Sure, the arrangements are very tightly knit and don’t allow much room for spontaneity, but they still sound fresh and uninhibited, and Alpert often allows the flavor of jazz to come through more clearly. Indeed, two of the album’s three hit singles, “The Work Song” and “Flamingo,” are jazz tunes — the former nervous and driving, the latter joyously kicking — and the third, “Mame,” gets a nifty Dixieland treatment a la Louis Armstrong, with Alpert singing one verse. The sleeping gem of the record is guitarist John Pisano’s “Freight Train Joe,” a wistfully evocative tune that won’t quit the memory, and the mournful Alpert/Pisano/Nick Ceroli tune “For Carlos” later became Wes Montgomery’s “Wind Song.” Though S.R.O. only went to number two on the LP charts, Alpert’s creativity and popularity were still peaking.


											







SOUNDS LIKE…















												
											
											
												SOUNDS LIKE…
												Original Release Date: 1967
Re-issue Date: 2015
For one week in June 1967, Sounds Like was able to break the Monkees‘ 31-week hammerlock on the number one slot on the charts — just two weeks before the Beatles‘ Sgt. Pepper took over and changed the world. This shows, lest you forget — and many have — just how popular Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass were, still spanning the generations during the Summer of Love, still putting out records as fresh and musical and downright joyous as this one. Though not as jazz-flavored as S.R.O., Sounds Like does preserve the feeling, particularly in the extended vamps on an updated slave song, “Wade in the Water” (a hit single). “Gotta Lotta Livin’ to Do” settles you into the record with nothing but a long vamp — a daring production decision. Yet Alpert was on a roll; everything he tried in the TJB‘s heyday seemed to work. The lesser-known tunes back-loaded on side two are a string of pearls — John Pisano‘s appropriately titled bossa nova “The Charmer,” Roger Nichols‘ tense “Treasure of San Miguel,” Ervan Coleman‘s catchy “Miss Frenchy Brown.” Finally, Alpert takes a flyer and concludes the LP with an extravagant Burt Bacharach orchestration of his theme from the film Casino Royale — an artifact of ’60s pop culture, to be sure, but still a perfectly structured record.
 


											







HERB ALPERT’S NINTH















												
											
											
												HERB ALPERT’S NINTH
												Original Release Date: 1967
Re-issue Date: 2015
The cover art of Herb Alpert’s Ninth is hilarious — a bust of grim old Beethoven wearing a Herb Alpert sweatshirt, a parody of the pop icon fad going around at the time and maybe a comment on the rock world’s newfound pretensions in the wake of the Beatles‘ Sgt. Pepper. In any case, Herb Alpert’s Ninth does introduce some highbrow pretensions of sorts to Alpert‘s Ameriachi sound — some very subtly applied strands of strings on several numbers and a madcap, multi-sectioned fantasy of tunes from Bizet‘s Carmen that is full of in-jokes from the opera and the TJB‘s hits. Alpert is also quite aware of the brave new world around him; he does a spare, lazy, yet entirely novel-sounding cover version of Sgt. Pepper‘s “With a Little Help from My Friends” and gives the Supremes‘ “The Happening” a bouncy workout. There is also a touching memorial to the late Ervan Coleman (“Bud”) and another underrated contribution from the Alpert songwriting team, Sol Lake‘s swinging “Cowboys and Indians.” The TJB still churns out the Latin American rhythms, but sometimes with a shade less exuberance.
 


											







THE BEAT OF THE BRASS















												
											
											
												THE BEAT OF THE BRASS
												Original Release Date: 1968
Re-issue Date: 2015
Meant as the companion album to a Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass television special of the same name and packaged in a fancy double-fold LP jacket, The Beat of the Brass came out amid signs that Alpert‘s hot streak was finally beginning to run out. Not quite. Viewer requests for a new Burt Bacharach song, “This Guy’s in Love with You” — featuring an Alpert vocal — were so strong that A&M released it as a single, which shot up to number one and took The Beat of the Brass with it to the top. Herb‘s vocal is touching in its strained naïveté; he sounds sincere, and that overrides the lush, overbearing Bacharach orchestral arrangement. The rest of the album generated an often nostalgic quality then and now; the tunes by John Pisano and Sol Lake are exquisite, and Alpert‘s arrangements of songs like “Thanks for the Memory” seem autumnal in quality, as if an era were about to close. The band still has the ability to groove; the vamp on Julius Wechter‘s bossa nova “Panama,” with Wechter‘s jazzy vibes and Pisano‘s strong rhythm guitar, could have been stretched to half an hour. Yet Alpert‘s trumpet sounds a bit withered at times, and the band vocals and cloying children’s chorus on “Talk to the Animals” could be done without.


											







CHRISTMAS ALBUM















												
											
											
												CHRISTMAS ALBUM
												Original Release Date: 1968
Re-issue Date: 2015
Herb Alpert turned to jazz’s Shorty Rogers — then toiling in the L.A. film and TV studios — for voice and string arrangements on his Christmas album, and Rogers in turn went all out for schmaltz. Rogers‘ cooing voices introduce several of the tunes, whereupon the Tijuana Brass do their mostly unrelated Ameriachi thing familiar from past albums. Indeed, “Las Mananitas” seems to have been lifted from an obscure B-side of a 45 and overdubbed with the Rogers treatment. Jingling bells is a recurring song theme — first with “Jingle Bells,” then the cloying “The Bell That Couldn’t Jingle,” and ultimately “Jingle Bell Rock.” For the first time in a long time, Alpert‘s sense of pacing occasionally goes awry; “My Favorite Things” nearly comes apart in the silences and piano/vocal interlude between the TJB grooves, and “Sleigh Ride” screeches to a dead halt. And yet time and further exposure has revealed this record’s homey charms, which no doubt is one reason why it continues to be available on CD where other TJB best-sellers have fallen by the wayside.
 


											







WARM















												
											
											
												WARM
												Original Release Date: 1969
Re-issue Date: 2015
Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass shed almost all of the dust of Tijuana on this mellow, richly textured album; one reviewer at the time wrote that Alpert seemed to have exchanged bullrings for wedding rings. Lest one think that the TJB came down with a terminal case of the warm fuzzies, though, there are some selections here that sizzle — particularly the old standard “The Continental” — and in terms of arrangements and song selection, the accent falls on Brazil more than on any other TJB album. Shorty Rogers again was called in to provide voices and orchestrations, but he is more tasteful here than on the Christmas Album, the extreme dynamic range on Harry Nilsson‘s “Without Her” notwithstanding. A different take of “To Wait for Love” — the lovely, Bacharach-penned, Alpert-sung follow-up to “This Guy’s in Love with You” from 1968 — is included here, as is the fine single “Zazueira.” Yet Warm was the first non-seasonal TJB album in some time that couldn’t crack the Top 20, for the Brass‘ cross-generational appeal was fading fast.

The Western motif on the double-fold album jacket — with Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass in costume — signals this as another companion album to a TV special. But there is a deeper significance to this LP, for shortly after its release, a burned-out, personally troubled Alpert disbanded the Brass and retired from music for awhile. Indeed, stretches of this record reveal a tired group and a leader whose trumpet has lost much of its old zip. Even so, as on all TJB albums, there are several gems — the stunning shifts in texture and tempo that enliven the worn-out “Moon River,” the chugging bluegrass-tinged arrangement of Villa-Lobos’ “The Little Train of the Caipira” that masquerades under the name of the title track, a haunting rendition of the Beatles’ “I’ll Be Back,” the fast samba treatment of “Anna.” Dave Grusin and Shorty Rogers contribute an occasional orchestration, and Alpert does a modest vocal turn on the lush “You Are My Life.” But this time, the old sales magic was gone; the Tijuana Brass had suddenly become unhip in polarized 1969.
 


											







Summer Time















												
											
											
												Summer Time
												Original Release Date: 1971
Re-issue Date: 2015
Though Herb Alpert was technically taking a sabbatical from music in the early 1970s, he wasn’t entirely inactive, recording in dribs and drabs. So A&M assembled this brief collection of singles and stray cuts in the summer of 1971; it went nowhere on the charts but added some pleasing entries to the Alpert discography. The two best cuts, taken from a 1970 single, are as good as anything from the Tijuana Brass‘ heyday, with Alpert‘s own haunting tone poem “Jerusalem” and a great, strutting arrangement of “Strike Up the Band.” The title track, with a dual vocal by Alpert and his wife Lani Hall, is also intriguing, drawing inspiration from the famous Miles Davis/Gil Evans version, while Alpert pulls off a really good jazz trumpet solo on “The Nicest Things Happen.” Otherwise, most of the tracks on this LP lack energy, and even vigorous arrangements like that of the Beach Boys‘ “Darlin'” drift off distractedly into the ozone. Clearly, Alpert wasn’t quite ready to re-emerge full-blown into the performing world.


											







YOU SMILE – THE SONG BEGINS















												
											
											
												YOU SMILE – THE SONG BEGINS
												Original Release Date: 1974
Re-issue Date: 2015
His four-year sabbatical over, Herb Alpert returned to the studio creatively refreshed, his trumpet sounding more soulful and thoughtful, his ears attuned more than ever to jazz. The name of his studio group has been shortened to just the initials T.J.B., in whose ranks one hears the familiar mallets of Julius Wechter and the lazy trombone of Bob Edmondson, and the old Mexican flavors still come through now and then. But Alpert was definitely still in a pensive mood, and his evocative self-penned title track and choice of tunes like “Alone Again (Naturally)” and “Save the Sunlight” reinforce the LP’s mellow, ’70s contemporary pop atmosphere. Even the upbeat remake of the TJB’s “Up Cherry Street” is filtered through a phase-shifted gauze, a wistful rose-colored vision of the past. Left over from a 1973 single is a terrific, subtle, Latin-jazz-tinged arrangement of “Last Tango In Paris,” with a distinctive orchestral helping hand from Quincy Jones.


											







CONEY ISLAND















												
											
											
												CONEY ISLAND
												Original Release Date: 1975
Re-issue Date: 2015
Encouraged by his comeback album, Herb Alpert assembled a new version of the TJB — including a hotshot second trumpeter, Bob Findley, and jazz piano whiz Dave Frishberg — and hit the studio and road in 1975. Yet Coney Island was a brave, nearly complete departure from the old Tijuana Brass, where the jazzers were given carte blanche and the rhythm section encouraged to do more complex things. As a signal of independence, the new Brass tackle Chick Corea’s “Senor Mouse” head-on, where Frishberg runs wild and even longtime marimbist Julius Wechter is affected by the adventurous spirit. Alpert’s own playing on trumpet (and now flugelhorn and piano) is a bit freer as well, and he goes out on a limb as a composer with the experimental, not-quite-coherent “Carmine.” TJB tradition is also served by a loose, swinging version of “I Have Dreamed,” and an older legacy pops up in the Alpert/Frishberg duet on Jelly Roll Morton’s “The Crave.” But this edition of the Brass was short-lived; the public didn’t get it and Alpert soon moved on to solo projects, leaving this sole LP as its legacy.
 


											







MAIN EVENT















												
											
											
												MAIN EVENT
												Original Release Date: 1978
Re-issue Date: 2015
“Let the good times roll,” Herb Alpert seemed to say as he quickly rejoined forces with Masekela for a follow-up LP to their first collaboration earlier that year. Recording live at the Roxy Theatre and on A&M’s soundstage without duplicating anything on their earlier studio album, the two horn players (Alpert on trumpet, Masekela on flugelhorn) are, if anything, looser and more freewheeling than before. Though Alpert is not on quite as sure a jazz footing as Masekela, neither musician tries to blow the other out of the room. The band, containing only one holdover (guitarist Arthur Adams) from the first album, is more attuned to Latin funk/jazz with a South African tinge this time. Again, Alpert and Masekela have mostly fine tunes to work with, none better than “Foreign Natives” and “Shame the Devil” by African trombonist Mosa Jonas Gwangwa, plud Henry Sithole’s wistfully haunting “Mama Way” (which has chanted vocals and a string quartet). This album and its predecessor had the effect of recharging Alpert’s music, though both are almost forgotten today.


											







HERB ALPERT & HUGH MASEKELA















												
											
											
												HERB ALPERT & HUGH MASEKELA
												Original Release Date: 1978
Re-issue Date: 2017
A mustachioed Herb Alpert breaks out of his ’70s blue funk to fuse himself with fellow horn player Hugh Masekela and producer/pianist Caiphus Semenya in a magnificent LP of South African/American pop/jazz. From the joyous opening strains of the South African oldie “Skokiaan,” to the haunting groove of “Moonza,” Alpert wholeheartedly melts into Masekela‘s distinctive idiom, his trumpet a relaxed foil for the South African exile’s blazing flügelhorn. But Masekela can also lean the other way, joining Alpert in TJB-like dual harmony on “Ring Bell.” The band is mostly a coterie of L.A. sessionmen, but they can swing along to the township jive pretty well, and they have some excellent musical material (mostly by Semenya) to work with. Alpert sounds like he’s having more fun making music than he has in a long time.


											







RISE















												
											
											
												RISE
												Original Release Date: 1969
Re-issue Date: 2015
If the 12″ single of Herb Alpert‘s “Rise” hadn’t taken over the charts the way it did back in 1979, one wonders if anyone would have gotten around to checking out the Tijuana Brass, or if Alpert would have gone down in the books as the guy who had a number one with a Burt Bacharach tune (“This Guy’s in Love with You”). Instead, the cut energized the entire dance club generation, with DJs looking for new grooves, and it even ended up being used by Sean “Puffy” Combs on the Notorious B.I.G.‘s Hypnotise, albeit in a drastically re-morphed form. The single began as a disc track composed by Alpert‘s nephew Randy and his pal Andy Armer. Alpert suggested they slow the groove way down and turn it into a slow mover. They issued it without an album to go with it, simply as a single on A&M. Club DJs picked up on it and began using duplicate copies either to let the percussion break go on a bit longer before trumpet kicked in, or playing one copy just behind another, creating a call-and-response melody with the trumpet and the rhythm section. After the single stormed the charts and stayed there all summer, eventually hitting the number one spot, Alpert, Armer, and friends went about assembling an album to capitalize on it.
They did well: Rise hit number six on the Billboard pop chart. The rest of the tracks are a slew of originals and covers. The set opens with a small pomp and circumstance intro called “1980” that Alpert composed for the Olympics that year, assisted by the late Michel Colombier on keyboards. Alpert also composed the ballad-turned-Latin-dancefloor fire walker “Behind the Rain,” (originally composed for Gato Barbieri‘s Caliente! album) that has its own appeal in the 21st century with chorus-like backing vocals. Other tracks include the Armer and Randy Alpert “Rotation.” This cut, introduced by hand percussion, bells, and shakers is another soulful groover with a killer, soft-spoken keyboard line that’s hypnotic lite funk. A looped synth line enters in place of a bassline. Handclaps, fingersnaps, and Alpert‘s distant trumpet play a melody not unlike the one on the “Lonely Bull.” Effects, washes, reverb, and mild distortion create a futuristic backdrop to this otherwise beautifully melodic tune. Alpert plays in-the-pocket soul-drenched melody lines over the top and one of the first “chillout” tunes was born.
What it all adds up to is an extraordinary recording that stands the test of time as a bona fide classic of the late disco/pre hip-hop era. The pop charts would have none of it these days. But eating this up as folks did, pre-MTV, with simply the radio going nuts trying to introduce the next single from it, Alpert, his nephew, and Armer stumbled onto something that would reinvigorate Alpert‘s career as a recording artist and as a producer.


											







BEYOND















												
											
											
												BEYOND
												Original Release Date: 1980
Re-issue Date: 2015
Naturally, the wild success of “Rise” would lead anyone to the temptation of repeating oneself, and at first, this follow-up LP does plenty of that, grafting the same slow, hand-clapping beat onto several numbers. But Alpert won’t sit still for long, and he comes through with some startling things that wake up the record midway through. The funky, percolating party beat of “Red Hot” starts the engine, which is pushed to an electrifying degree by the sequencer-driven, Echoplexed, hard-charging title track, where we hear Alpert’s distinctive horn through a metallic electronic buffer. The most amazing track is the finale, “The Factory,” a terrifying, relentlessly grinding depiction of a soulless foundry that must have shocked sedate former TJB fans who bought this album on a lark, expecting happy music from the past. Bold stuff indeed, and it did make some impact on the charts, though not nearly to the degree of Rise.


											







MAGIC MAN















												
											
											
												MAGIC MAN
												Original Release Date: 1981
Re-issue Date: 2015
The high-flying confidence of Rise and the experimental bent of Beyond began to wear off by 1981, giving way to the more relaxed but musically weaker ministrations of Magic Man. With Michael Stokes, then A&M’s director of Black Product/A&R, co-producing, Alpert came up with a pleasant collection of mostly forgettable, mild-mannered R&B/pop-slanted tunes, plus a fairly uneventful rendition-at-length of “Besame Mucho” and a redundant cha-cha/disco remake of his own “You Smile, The Song Begins.” Alpert‘s haunting trumpet still reflects his post-“Rise” sense of command, but he doesn’t have much to say this time; the material holds him back.
 


											







FANDANGO















												
											
											
												FANDANGO
												Original Release Date: 1982
Re-issue Date: 2015
Challenged and fired up by some new Mexican colleagues, Herb Alpert set out to make a record specifically for the Latin American market and ended up producing a masterpiece — the equal of the best Tijuana Brass albums, and in some ways maybe better than any of them. Fandango has a more authentically Latin American sound than the cosmopolitan TJB records, using rhythms from Mexico to South America, adding a coating of strings or synthesizers and Alpert’s soaring trumpets. More importantly, with the help of co-producer Jose Quintana, Alpert lined up some incredibly beautiful material from then-little-known writers like Juan Carlos Calderon, Diego Verdaguer and Roberto Carlos. Some of these tracks are spine-chilling in their emotional pull and uncanny sense of structure; Alpert the master of the studio working at his peak. Alpert’s magnificent renderings of Calderon’s high-flying “Route 101” (a Top 40 hit single) and aching “Margarita” are perfect records; you wouldn’t want to change a note. He also has a ball with Verdaguer’s driving “Coco Loco,” and the concluding track is a fast-moving medley of Latin American hits starting with Mexico’s “Frenesi” and rambling through Brazil’s “Bahia” and Spain’s “Moliendo Cafe” before riding off with the irresistible Venezuelan “Porompompero.” As much as one hates to limit the horizons of an adventurous musician like Herb Alpert, one must admit that Latin influences inspire his best work — and whether working in a Latin framework or not, he has yet to equal this album.
 


											







BLOW YOUR OWN HORN















												
											
											
												BLOW YOUR OWN HORN
												Original Release Date: 1983
Re-issue Date: 2017
This album is typical of Herb Alpert‘s ’80s style, with his familiar horn sound grafted to contemporary dance and R&B rhythm tracks. He even got the old Motown team of Holland-Dozier-Holland to write and co-produce a couple of tunes. Although there is nothing here to rival Alpert‘s 1979 comeback “Rise,” he had multi-format success with the album, which charted pop, R&B, and jazz and threw off two chart singles, “Garden Party” and “Red Hot.”
 


											







BULLISH















												
											
											
												BULLISH
												Original Release Date: 1984
Re-issue Date: 2017
Yes, Herb Alpert did indeed record an album in 1984 under the name Tijuana Brass for the first time in nine years — and in fact, he took a Tijuana Brass contingent on tour that year with four of the original bandmembers on hand. But this album has nothing to do with the old TJB, for the music is the same high-tech pop of the 1980s that Alpert had been mostly purveying since “Rise,” and with synths galore, a frantic electronic dance beat on many numbers, and none of the original Brass on the sessions. No wonder, for the arranger is John Barnes, who had worked for the Jacksons (Alpert was no fool; the Jacksons‘ sound was never hotter). About all that remains of the TJB is Alpert‘s familiar trumpet, which often hearkens back to his ’60s manner in this gleaming setting. The best moments are the whomping title track, the hyperactive “Struttin’ on Five,” and the optimistic “Life Is My Song.” But to call this a “Tijuana Brass” album is bordering on consumer fraud for the faithful — though on its own terms, it is a fairly live slice of ’80s pop.
 


											







KEEP YOUR EYE ON ME















												
											
											
												KEEP YOUR EYE ON ME
												Original Release Date: 1987
Re-issue Date: 2015
The unbelievable sales success of this record is a testament to Herb Alpert’s extraordinary ability to keep his ear to the ground — no doubt aided by his position as vice-chairman and co-owner of A&M Records — and adapt to the times. At a time when A&M’s Janet Jackson was blazing up the charts, Alpert journeyed to Minneapolis and cut some tracks with Jackson’s producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, producing the others himself in a mostly similar techno-pop vein. Presto!, three Top Ten R&B singles came out of the album, “Keep Your Eye on Me,” “Making Love in the Rain,” and the number one hit “Diamonds.” The flashy, trashy “Diamonds” no doubt was aided on its rush up the charts by Jackson and Lisa Keith’s bouncy lead vocals; it’s really their record and that of Jam and Lewis, despite Alpert’s top billing. Jackson and Keith also take the lead in the simple-minded lyrics of “Making Love in the Rain,” which nevertheless has a haunting effect accented by Alpert’s muted musings through an electronic gauze. At first, this seems like a gleaming digital machine of a record, loaded with repetitive sampling effects and drum machines churning out that ubiquitous ’80s backbeat. But the techno stuff gradually gives way to Alpert’s humane trumpet, which in a touching valentine to the ’60s on Acker Bilk’s “Stranger on the Shore,” is eventually allowed to soar unimpeded over the electronics.
 


											







NORTH ON SOUTH ST















												
											
											
												NORTH ON SOUTH ST
												Original Release Date: 1991
Re-issue Date: 2015
Ever attuned to what is happening out there in recordland, Herb Alpert tried to graft his trumpet onto the rhythms and textures of hip-hop and techno-dance music in North On South St., hoping again to crash the R&B charts. He used four young black co-producers (Greg Smith, Robert Jerald, Jimmy B and Troy Staton) and they get some festively percolating grooves going on tracks like “Passion Lady” and “Paradise 25.” Clearly Alpert’s early jazz leanings were beckoning more strongly, and his Miles Davis-like musings over the dance tumult actually anticipated the acid-jazz movement later in the decade, making this a historically important record. Yet there is something melancholy about Alpert’s playing on this album, like a lonely figure from the past looking in on a party from an outside window on the street, genuinely wanting to join in but unable to totally connect. Still, for someone of Alpert’s age (56) at the time of release, it is amazing that he was willing and able to stay in touch with the cutting edge of contemporary pop.
 


											







MIDNIGHT SUN















												
											
											
												MIDNIGHT SUN
												Original Release Date: 1992
Re-issue Date: 2015
Having recently sold A&M to PolyGram for a cool $500 million, and with his short but hugely affecting association with the late Stan Getz on his mind, Herb Alpert finally took the plunge and recorded what he called a jazz album, his last for the label he co-founded. But this would not be a conventional blowing session; rather it is an intimate, inward, wee-small-hours kind of album where, muted and not, Alpert’s horn sighs, laments and sings over a conventional rhythm section and underneath a blanket of lush strings. Without a doubt, Miles Davis in his introspective ’50s mode is Herb’s primary inspiration — always has been — and he uses space between the notes in similar ways, but always with his own tone and distinct phrasing. Two old favorites from the TJB days, “A Taste of Honey” and “I’ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face,” are revisited; “Taste” is completely transformed into a dark elegy that breaks into the light before turning back to the shadows. One track, “Friends,” was left over from 1990, where Herb was joined by a luminous-sounding Getz; they really play like intimate friends together. This is not a terribly spontaneous album — Alpert is too much the master of structure to leave very much to chance — but it creates a mood of melancholy serenity that is difficult to resist.


											







ANYTHING GOES















												
											
											
												ANYTHING GOES
												Original Release Date: 2009
Re-issue Date: 2016
Herb Alpert had never really embraced his inner jazzman over the course of an entire album before; the closest he came was 1992’s Midnight Sun, ultimately a highly controlled cocoon of a recording. But this, at long last, is it, and it represents a string of firsts for the protean trumpeter — his first truly straight-ahead jazz project, his first all-new album of any kind in ten years, his first complete album with his wife, singer Lani Hall (who gets co-billing), and his first released by a label which he did not co-own. The concept grew out of a series of live dates that he and Hall played in various cities, from which these tracks were assembled. Despite some apparent lightly applied overdubs, it remains an intimate small group album of mostly standards, the kind of thing one might run across at Vibrato — Alpert‘s jazz club in the hills above Los Angeles. Hall appears in tandem with Alpert on nine of the 14 tracks — with Alpert taking five for himself — which guarantees an additional unique layer of intimacy as Alpert wraps his pithy horn lovingly around Hall‘s voice. Hall has kept her Portuguese in gear, doing well by Ivan Lins‘ “Dinorah, Dinorah” and the rapid-fire syllables of “Para-Raio.” She adopts a dark, dusky tone on “That Old Black Magic,” and for “Let’s Face the Music And Dance,” she takes on an air of desperation, focusing on the words, “there may be trouble ahead.” Still in good shape in his seventies, Alpert retains the marcato bravado of the Tijuana Brass days and the more recent, terse, moody, muted tones of a Miles acolyte; in “It’s Only a Paper Moon,” these two personas go mano a mano rather humorously. “The Trolley Song,” done at an unusually lazy, loping pace by the Tijuana Brass more than four decades before, is taken at a more traditionally quick, Latin-accented tempo here, and this is the third time around for “I’ve Grown Accustomed to Your Face” — now a casual vocal showcase for Alpert with a witty coda that sneaks in a horn lick from “This Guy’s in Love with You.” The adept backup trio of Bill Cantos on keyboards — who comes up with a few nifty quotes himself — Hussain Jiffry on electric bass, and Michael Shapiro on drums and Latin percussion goes down agreeably. This is a classy, welcome return to album-making for Alpert, and a good fit for Concord’s adult-oriented roster.
 


											







I FEEL YOU















												
											
											
												I FEEL YOU
												Original Release Date: 2011
Re-issue Date: 2016
Trumpeter Herb Alpert and vocalist and wife Lani Hall teamed as a duo for the critically acclaimed live recording Anything Goes in 2009. I Feel You is the studio follow-up to that fine recording, and the contrasts between the two are marked. While the former album reflected new takes on the jazz canon, this one delves into rock, pop, jazz, and Brazilian tunes and interprets them with a contemporary international feel, without leaving jazz behind. Backed by their touring group — pianist/keyboardist Bill Cantos, drummer/percussionist Michael Shapiro, and bassist Hussain Jiffry — Alpert and Hall commence with a reading of Van Morrison‘s “Moondance” that is as influenced by Arabic modalism as it is the nocturnal bop-noir inherent in its melody. Led by a fretless bassline and shakers, Alpert runs through the lyric on muted trumpet. The pair begins singing together, over a minute in as the piano enters the fray and shakers are complemented by hand drums. “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” is a showcase for Hall‘s trademark phrasing and Alpert‘s jazz-wise improvisation on a Caribbean-based rhythm. It’s languid, lovely, and, in its gentle way, it pops thanks to the rhythm section. Other highlights here include the Brazilian-flavored tunes: “There Will Never Be Another You” (even with Alpert‘s reedy vocals), “Berimbau,” “The Corner (Clube’ de Esquina),” and “Viola.” Hall‘s vocals — which are still in top form — and Alpert‘s playing complement one another symbiotically (especially on the latter tune). The reading of “Here Comes the Sun” is radical. It’s double-timed by Shapiro’s snare and painted by Cantos‘ Rhodes piano with an alternate melody played by Jiffry‘s electric bass while Alpert and Hall hold down the original melody (trumpet and vocal) in the quiet storm. Likewise, “Blackbird” is performed as a funky modern jazz number with smooth samba overtones. The African drumming on “What Now My Love,” with Alpert‘s clipped (and slightly reverbed) phrasing on the melody transforms the tune. The reading of “Call Me” (which he produced for Chris Montez in 1965) is reinvented here as a lithe, syncopated romantic groover. Less successful is “Fever,” because its center isn’t in the vocal or trumpet but in the rhythm section’s interplay. That quibble aside, I Feel You is an excellent contemporary jazz recording by a veteran duo whose intuition is nearly flawless.


											







STEPPIN’ OUT















												
											
											
												STEPPIN’ OUT
												RELEASED 2013
Trumpeter and pop music icon Herb Alpert and his wife, former Brasil ’66 vocalist Lani Hall, have recorded and performed together a few times since meeting over 43 years ago. However, it wasn’t until 2007 that the duo began touring and performing regularly. In 2009, they released the album Anything Goes, which found them interpreting standards and Brazilian music. They followed that album up with 2011’s I Feel You, which continued in the jazz, Brazilian, and Latin music vein, adding in more contemporary pop songs. Alpert and Hall‘s 2013 release, Steppin’ Out, also features a warm collection of songs that hit upon all the stylistic touchstones of their careers, from ’60s novelty instrumentals to Latin music, Brazilian bossa nova, smooth jazz, and American popular song standards. Once again joining Alpert and Hall here is their touring ensemble featuring pianist/keyboardist Bill Cantos, drummer/percussionist Michael Shapiro, and bassist Hussain Jiffry. Steppin’ Out also reunites Alpert with keyboardist Jeff Lorber, who appeared on Alpert‘s 1997 album, Passion Dance, and who produced his 1996 album, Second Wind. Generally speaking, Steppin’ Out is the most stylistically varied of the three Alpert/Hall albums, moving from an electronic/dance reworking of “Puttin’ on the Ritz” to the atmospheric orchestral ballad “I Only Have Eyes for You,” Hall‘s poignant interpretation of Irving Berlin‘s “What’ll I Do?,” a dramatic symphonic take on Astor Piazzolla‘s 1982 nuevo tango masterpiece “Oblivion,” and the smooth funk of the Alpert/Lorber original “Migration.” The album even ends with Alpert revisiting his 1963 Tijuana Brass breakthrough hit “The Lonely Bull,” this time with additional orchestral and electronic flourishes that sound less ’60s lounge pad and more contemporary James Bond action movie theme, accented by Alpert‘s Miles Davis-influenced soloing. Ultimately, Steppin’ Out represents not just the third album in a trilogy, but a loving creative partnership that, for Alpert and Hall, spans a lifetime.
 


											







IN THE MOOD















												
											
											
												IN THE MOOD
												RELEASED 2014
Although trumpeter and pop icon Herb Alpert is largely associated with his jazz, Latin, and lounge instrumentals of the ’60s and ’70s, he’s never fully retired from the music scene. In fact, Alpert‘s 2013 album with wife and vocalist Lani Hall won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Coming on the heels of that album, Alpert‘s 2014 effort, In the Mood, finds the stylistically wide-ranging artist once again bringing together a mix of jazz standards, smooth pop instrumentals, and infectious original compositions. Working with his nephew, arranger/producer Randy Badazz Alpert, as well as such longtime collaborators as Bill Conti, Mike Shapiro, and Jeff Lorber, Alpert has crafted an album that perfectly updates his approach for a modern audience. Alpert was an early adopter of electronic sounds and In the Mood is no exception as it features a very club-ready, EMD reworking of the swing-era classic “Chattanooga Choo Choo.” It’s an iconoclastic move also echoed in his funky, hip-hop-inflected take on “Blue Moon.” While Alpert always seems to be in search of new musical ground to explore, he’s conversely never afraid to revisit his past, as evidenced by his electronic- and contemporary R&B-infused arrangement of his old Tijuana Brass number “Spanish Harlem.” Elsewhere, Alpert teams again with Hall for several gorgeous, laid-back Latin numbers including the funky “Don’t Cry,” and the romantic “5 A.M.” And it’s not just Alpert‘s knack for crafting listenable, relaxing pop songs that makes In the Mood so enjoyable. Arguably, Alpert‘s trumpet playing has only deepened over the years and cuts here, like his poignant orchestral reading of “When Sunny Gets Blue,” reveal his gift for small group jazz balladry that brings to mind a mix of Chet Baker and Harry Sweets Edison. Ultimately, whether he’s digging deep into a jazz standard, or defying expectations with a breezy electronic arrangement, Alpert proves yet again he is a true pop journeyman on In the Mood.
 


											







COME FLY WITH ME















												
											
											
												COME FLY WITH ME
												RELEASED 2015
Since his 2009 return to regular recording after a ten-year hiatus, trumpeter Herb Alpert has stayed busy releasing albums, some with his wife, vocalist Lani Hall, and others, like 2015’s Come Fly with Me, on his own. 80 years old at the time of this release, Alpert has gone from instrumental pop icon of the ’60s and ’70s to journeyman performer with decades of experience to draw from. Working with a bevy of longtime collaborators including his nephew, programmer Randy “Badazz” Alpert, bassist/guitarist/producer Hussain Jiffry, keyboardist/producer Bill Cantos, keyboardist/guitarist Jeff Lorber, Alpert has crafted a breezy, low-key collection of originals and cover tunes, that nonetheless retains all of the melodic, jazz-inflected style of his classic recordings. Although Alpert takes on a handful of standards here, he approaches them with a creative sense of fun. To these ends, he reworks the classic Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen title track into a Day-Glo, Brazilian bossa nova production. Similarly, on Irving Berlin‘s “Blue Skies,” Alpert‘s supple trumpet is framed by lush orchestral strings that give way to a laid-back reggae groove accented by vibrato-soaked, Beatles-esque guitar hits. And it’s not just Broadway standards that benefit from the Alpertization process — the Beatles influence pops up again, this time with his stripped-down, ethereal take on the band’s 1969 classic “Something.” One of the most interesting and effective transformations here is Alpert‘s R&B style overhaul of “I’ve Got a Lot of Livin’ to Do,” from the musical Bye Bye Birdie. Kicking off with an introspective keyboard figure, the song sounds like something along the lines of Miles Davis covering a yearning ’90s soul ballad. As with most all of Alpert‘s post-2009 material, Come Fly with Me is a much more low-key and intimate recording than the productions that marked the best of his ’60s Tijuana Brass period. That said, by keeping things simple, Alpert and his collaborators illuminate all of the tenderness and direct lyricism of his horn playing.
 


											







Human Nature















												
											
											
												Human Nature
												Release Date: 2016
Legendary pop and jazz icon Herb Alpert continues his prolific career run with his 2016 studio album, Human Nature. The album follows up his well-received 2014 effort, In the Mood, and picks up on that album’s mix of electronic pop and Latin-inflected, dance-oriented grooves. In his eighties at the time of recording, he has aged into a soulful, lyrical musician able to bridge the light pop stylings of his youth with more introspective choices. Human Nature finds him completely engaged, continuing to explore new sounds and songs. Joining Alpert here are several longtime collaborators in producer/percussionist Michael Shapiro, producer/arranger/keyboardist Eduardo Del Barrio, bassist/guitarist Hussain Jiffry, keyboardist/arranger/producer Bill Cantos, and others. As with Alpert‘s other albums since coming out of a ten-year hiatus in 2009, Human Nature finds the trumpeter applying his distinctively sweet-toned sound to a nicely balanced combination of beloved pop standards, unexpected covers, and originals. Sometimes, as on the title track, an inspired Brazilian Mardi Gras-infused reworking of Michael Jackson‘s “Human Nature,” Alpert goes for an inventive cross-genre angle. Other times, as on his lush, romantic reading of the Burt Bacharach/Elvis Costello-ballad “Look Up Again,” he takes a more straightforward approach, framing his yearning Miles Davis–esque lines with reverb-soaked piano and shimmering orchestral strings. Alpert even draws upon his iconic Tijuana Brass double-tracked trumpet sound for a bright, electro-Latin take on the Burt Bacharach/Hal David classic “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” which also features vocals from his wife, muse, and frequent collaborator Lani Hall. Elsewhere, Alpert strikes a similarly pleasant, cross-genre stance with his originals, like the disco-salsa “Shake It” and the sophisticated, cocktail hour-ready Latin jazz of “Mystery Man.” Ultimately, Human Nature is a warmly produced album by an artist who has seen and done it all, and yet still finds magic and mystery in the process.

 Time had come for Doug to pay for her loveLaverne was everything Doug wanted in a woman, but little did he realize she had a disturbed personality. As Laverne's life gradually filled with anxiety, she thought up morbid schemes, and then, slowly and methodically, plotted her course. Doug failed to recognize the vital signs of her mental illness, and in time, she manipulated him into carrying out her insidious proposals.

It pushes the limits of what a person will do for the one they love. You have to ask yourself what would your own boundaries be? Our protagonist is a man who finds himself in a web of lies so complex that he almost drowns in a bottle of scotch as he tries to figure out what to do. His crimes haunt him as much as his love for a woman.Hats off to Henry Albert for his grand and twisted plot, tight writing and unexpected ending. He faithfully practices his craft and deserves kudos for this thrilling work of fiction.
