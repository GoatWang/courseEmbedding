Lightness of Stone
Ten years back, Italian stone show Marmomacc challenged architects to achieve designs of marble and stone that typically were reserved for lighter building materials. That year, architects brought natural stone innovations to the stands of exhibition halls. The designs precipitated an outpouring of innovative products from Italian stone companies like Lithos. Its latest product, Diaframmi, part of the Lithos Design Primes collection, is a fine, 3D, translucent marble membrane. The marble material escapes the traditional role as a sculptural stone in favor of this mysterious, fabrication art form resulting in a decorative partition.

      When Art, Architecture and Commerce Collided: The BEST Products Showrooms by SITE
    






Save this picture!
















According to one survey, images of the BEST Products Showroom in Houston, Texas, designed by SITE (Sculpture in the Environment), appeared in more books on 20th-century architecture than any other building. The intentionally crumbling brick at that Houston store, known as “Indeterminate Façade,” and the eight other showrooms SITE designed, were simultaneously iconic and controversial, and most importantly for BEST, they brought in customers. Although SITE-founder James Wines never considered himself a Postmodernist architect, his designs for BEST, completed between 1972 and 1984, steeped in whimsical social commentary, came to symbolize the essence of Postmodernism. Today, all but one of the BEST showrooms have been demolished or altered beyond recognition, but they set a lasting precedent, and continue to influence the use of architecture in corporate branding today.

James Wines began his career as a sculptor and visual artist. He was part of the environmental art movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, along with artists such as Robert Smithson and Gordon Matta-Clark, which focused on taking the art scene beyond sterile gallery spaces, and, as Wines described, putting art where you would least expect it.

    Forest Building. Image © SITE
  


BEST Products was a chain of catalogue showroom retail stores in the United States from the late 1950s until the company went out of business in 1997. The company’s founders, Sydney and Frances Lewis, were avid art collectors, and in the early 1970s they began working with Wines’ environmental art and architecture studio on a series of buildings for the retail chain. The Lewises were interested in bringing their love of art to their retail business and, working with Wines and SITE, rather than placing a piece of art out in front of the stores, they wanted their stores to actually become the art.

    Notch Building. Image © SITE
  


Wines saw the buildings as an exploration of the boundary between art and architecture, and working from the starting point of the ubiquitous and familiar big-box store archetype provided even greater freedom to blur the line. SITE’s work for BEST was often met with staunchly negative criticism–especially following the completion of Indeterminate Façade in Houston–by the mainstream architectural press who saw no place for humor in architecture, but the Lewises continued to support the work in spite of the critical response. On the other hand, Wines’ friends and contemporaries–especially in the art world–envied his freedom to create works that, in their exploration of decay, neglect, and artificiality, so obviously critiqued the throwaway nature of American consumer culture, the source of his clients’ business success.

Despite the criticisms, and the tongue-in-cheek nature of the designs, SITE’s architecture helped fuel BEST’s commercial success at the time. That success has no doubt inspired other companies to pursue distinctive architecture as part of a branding strategy, but in a recent conversation with ArchDaily Wines was quick to point out that most companies want an infinitely replicable architectural identity that manifests as little more than decoration, whereas each of the BEST stores, though consistent in theme, were each unique explorations of that theme in response to their individual contexts.Peeling Building – Richmond, Virginia – 1972

    Peeling Building. Image © SITE
  


The first of SITE’s buildings for BEST serves as a prelude to the social critiques and architectural acrobatics that would follow. The brick façade wall appears to be peeling away from the corner of the orthogonal box of the building envelope on one end, and from the entire side of the building on the other. The design is literally shedding the artifice to reveal the reality of the basic box underneath. At the same time, the peeling corner, precariously extending over the walkway, challenges traditional notions of the structural capabilities of brick.

Indeterminate Façade – Houston, Texas – 1974



Save this picture!
















The Indeterminate Façade project continued to play on traditional notions of brick structures by presenting an intentionally distressed façade that implies neglect and decay. The seemingly crumbling parapet culminates in a deep gouge on the front façade, complimented by a corresponding rubble-pile of bricks rising above the entrance portico. In its pre-ruined state, the building seems to foreshadow its own eventual demise.

Tilt Building – Towson, Maryland – 1976



Save this picture!













    Tilt Building. Image © SITE
  


The most structurally daring of the completed BEST projects, SITE worked extensively with structural engineers to create a counterbalance system that could enable the Tilt façade’s asymmetrical cantilever, while maintaining the visual illusion of the floating brick wall. Although Wines resists the Postmodern classification, historians Marvin Trachtenberg and Isabelle Hyman describe the Tilt Building as exemplifying and subverting the traditional Venturi-Scott Brown paradigm by simultaneously illustrating the concepts of both the “decorated shed” and the “duck,” as an ostensibly decorated box, while “connoting its meaning through it ‘sculptural’ shape more than its nominal ornamentation.”[1]

Notch Building – Sacramento, California – 1977

    Notch Building. Image © SITE
  


The Notch Building challenges traditional notions of entrance and doorway, creating a fortress-like uninterrupted brick box, without any openings when the store is closed. But when the store is open, almost like the drawbridge of a medieval castle, a small segment of the façade slides away to reveal an entrance in the resulting “notch.” Once again, SITE is suggesting decay in the seemingly random opening in the brick façade.

BEST Anti-Sign – Richmond, Virginia – 1978



Save this picture!













    BEST Anti-Sign. Image © SITE
  


Breaking from the previous BEST projects that had all explored various iterations of brick facades, for the Anti-Sign, SITE turned the entire building into giant sign, repeating the name “BEST” across the façade in giant letters that stretched the full height of the walls. Starting with a typical spacing at one end of the façade, the letters begin to overlap as the word repeats, eventually terminating in an illegible jumble, hinting at the high-speed experience of viewing the suburban built environment from a moving car.

Cutler Ridge Building – Miami, Florida – 1979



Save this picture!













    Cutler Ridge Building. Image © SITE
  


For the Cutler Ridge Building, SITE returned to masonry to explore a deconstructed version of the façade that extends out into the parking lot. In fact, the entire façade is completely separated from the actual building envelope. The bulk of the façade stands several feet in front of a glass curtain wall enclosure. The portico, seemingly ripped out of the main façade and leaving a trademark jagged brick outline, stands in the median of the driveway. Finally, two lone doorways mark the ends of the rows of parking stalls, as if bringing the store entrance as close as possible to shoppers’ cars.

Forest Building – Richmond, Virginia – 1979



Save this picture!













    Forest Building. Image © SITE
  


An existing forest on this site in Richmond, Virginia almost prevented the building from being built at all, until SITE proposed a design that would integrate the existing forest into the architecture of the showroom. Specialists spent months on the building site, re-training the roots of the trees to grow away from structural footings and foundations, and preserving the natural undergrowth, allowing nature and architecture to coexist. The result, as Wines describes in his book Green Architecture, is a “massive incision, splitting the building apart and allowing giant oak trees and ground cover to march through the open chasm.”[2] Only later did Wines realize that the added shading from the preserved trees significantly reduced the buildings need for air conditioning in summer months.

As of 2015, the Forest Building is the only BEST Showroom to remain in its original condition, preserved by the West End Presbyterian Church which bought the building soon after BEST closed down in the late 1990s.

Rainforest Building – Hialeah, Florida – 1979

Similar to the Forest Building, the Rainforest Building was inspired by existing forest on the building site. In this case, existing plants were preserved off site during construction, and then replaced as a part of a greenhouse façade, behind a glass water wall, which used recirculated water to help reduce the cooling load of the building.[3] The innovations in the Rainforest and Forest buildings would go on to inspire a career-spanning interest in sustainable architecture and passive design strategies at SITE.

Inside/Outside Building – Milwaukee, Wisconsin – 1984

    Inside/Outside Building. Image © SITE
  


SITE’s final building for BEST presented the most striking architectural commentary of all. Designed as a life-size cutaway diagram, SITE removed large chunks of the masonry façade, revealing mechanical systems above the suspended ceilings, as well as replica retail displays that exactly matched the displays on the inside of the glass curtain wall. The stark display of monochrome imitation bicycles, toys seemingly cut in half by the clear glass wall, and the air ducts and dropped ceiling all seem to critique the artificiality of the products inside the store.

Bought this shoe as an alternative to wearing "sandals" and or tennis shoes. Looks modest but is definitely a girly girl feminine shoe. Cute with a great pair of Jeans for that baby shower or casual social event. I ordered the tan color and wish that other colors were available in my size because I would order them. I am an older lady so the heel height is perfect and the closed toe is perfect for that less than perfect pedicure. True to size and comfortable for an easy breezy casual style however, I would not wear them as a walk around in all day/ touring Italy or Greece kind of shoe.

Opened the box and put them on and have been wearing them almost every day since. Thanks to David Tate Co. for making width-sensitive shoes! They are true to size and since I have a long narrow foot getting something that is snug, comfortable and looks good is a real winner for me. Am thinking of getting another pair. I highly recommend this shoe for comfort and
casual style.

This is a comfort shoe and very nice looking. The wedge is low and well balanced. I bought these shoes for travel and have been wearing them to make sure they feel good after a full day. So far so good!

Finally found a sandal that is comfortable! The toes for these shoes are not so narrow that they crush my toes and make my feet sore. I can wear these all day at work and even take 40 minute walks comfortably.

Managing Partners
Emre Toker
Emre.Toker@ArchPartnersLLC.com
Emre started his first technology company, MedOptics Corporation, in 1994 with a personal investment of only $10,000. Utilizing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants of over $2 million, MedOptics developed new digital imaging systems for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. From 1994 to 2000, MedOptics grew to become a highly profitable company and was acquired in 2000 by DALSA Corporation of Toronto, a Canadian public company, in a multimillion dollar transaction.
In 1998, realizing the potential of CMOS sensors (sensors now used in practically all consumer digital cameras) in the field of digital x-ray imaging, Emre teamed up with one of the leaders of solid state imager design, Mr. Gene Weckler, to form Rad-Icon Imaging Corporation in Silicon Valley. Rad-Icon also became a highly successful company as the leader in CMOS-based x-ray imagers and was subsequently acquired by DALSA Corporation for an undisclosed sum.
In 2001, using the same principles of very low initial investment and leveraging small business research and development grants, Emre started Bioptics Corporation, which developed FDA-cleared imaging systems for breast cancer surgery. Bioptics imaging systems are currently in clinical use in hundreds of hospitals worldwide. Following the award of an exclusive contract to Bioptics by the government of Ireland for the purchase of all of Ireland’s needs for breast cancer specimen radiography systems, Bioptics was acquired by an Irish private investment group based in Washington D.C. at a muiltimillion dollar valuaton.
Emre is currently working on his fourth venture, Surgical Tools, LLC, which is developing novel disposable and capital equipment products to improve the clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients who select lumpectomy over radical mastectomy in the treatment of their breast cancers. Surgical Tools has already been awarded two National Cancer Institute research and development grants to be used toward the development of these unique and innovative products.
Emre has authored and co-authored numerous patents and articles published in scientific and trade journals. He is a member of the Desert Angels and DesertTech, two Tucson-based angel investor groups, as well as a member of Lab-X, a Turkish angel investor group.
Emre has his BA in physics from Reed College, his BSEE from the California Institute of Technology, and his Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Arizona.

Associate Partners
Chuck Bolotin
Chuck.Bolotin@ArchPartnersLLC.com
Chuck is a “go to market” expert with experience in several diverse markets. He founded his first successful business when he was 15 years old. At the age of 23, he joined a commercial office equipment reseller. Within 5 years,he had become Vice President of Business Development, Marketing, and Sales, transformed the business, and had increased revenues in excess of 800%, with an 1,100% increase in earnings.
By the age of 28, Chuck founded and became CEO of Office Solutions, Inc., which, through several groundbreaking industry-first strategic alliances and his development and implementation of a highly successful consultative sales program, achieved industry-leading sales and overall financial performance (32% pre-tax profit).
After selling Office Solutions, Chuck founded and became CEO of InterMed Software, Inc., a company that created clinical automation software to run on a pen-based notebook PC. Chuck secured debt and equity financing, identified and negotiated with a strategic partner (a public company) that also brought in working capital, identified the eventual buyer, and negotiated the sale of InterMed Software in 1999.
In 2005, Chuck joined BioVigilant Systems (a venture-funded start-up) as Vice President, Marketing and Sales, with the charter to determine if the company’s IP had value in markets then unknown to the company. Within two months, Chuck identified a potential $2 billion+ market selling to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Chuck defined the “go to market” strategy and executed it with what was, at first, a small team. Achievements included forming a Consortium of 14 of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world, successful execution of the ongoing FDA submission strategy, and initial sales to 13 pharmaceutical manufacturers (also some of the largest in the world). Chuck left BioVigilant as Vice President, Pharma Business Unit.
In 2008, Chuck Founded On Target Consultants, specializing in “go to market” strategy and execution. In addition to being a founding Senior Partner of Arch Partners, Chuck also applies his knowledge and experience as a frequent lecturer at the Eller College of Management MBA Program, University of Arizona; and as a business mentor at the Arizona Center for Innovation.

 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 6, 1979       Pages 166-168 PUPIL DILATION MEASURES IN CONSUMER RESEARCH: APPLICATIONS AND  LIMITATIONS David C. Arch (Student), University of California, Los Angeles ABSTRACT -  Potential applications of pupil dilation measures to consumer research are  reviewed. Although the method is a valuable measure of mental activity in consumer tasks,  pupil dilations have limitations that will preclude their widespread use. INTRODUCTION Eight years have elapsed since the last published review on pupil dilation  measures in consumer behavior (Blackwell, Hensel, and Sternthal, 1970). The authors  concluded that pupil dilations, temporary changes in pupil size, may be an effective  measure of consumer response to advertising, but were unsure what processes the dilations  actually measured. More recently, several trends have been noted:   * a call by a number of researchers (Payne and Ragsdale, 1978; Russo,      1978) for joint methodologies to study consumer information processing leading to product      choices. The objective of multiple techniques is to improve the accuracy of process      measurement. * increased attention to eye fixations as a process-tracing device in      consumer behavior (Russo and Rosen, 1975) * a more definitive interpretation of what pupil dilations actually      measure (Goldwater, 1972).   Based on these trends, it is important to update the findings of  Blackwell, et. al., to determine if pupil dilations are appropriate and practical measures  for consumer behavior experimentation. While pupil dilation measures might fill a void in  the capabilities of current process-tracing methods, limitation of pupil dilation measures  will likely prevent their widespread use. THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PROCESS-TRACING METHODS A recent review by Russo (1978) discusses five process-tracing methods  currently being used in consumer behavior: chronometric analysis, eye fixations,  information boards, input-output analysis, and verbal protocols. One apparent weakness in  all the current methods is the failure to measure the importance consumers place on  individual information inputs (ads, information board cards, etc.) as a basis for their  response or choice. In fact, most methods rely on indirect measures of importance, such as  the subject's self-report, or avoid the question of importance entirely. Without a true  measure of importance, researchers are at a loss to explain the impact of information, one  of the areas where consumer behavior studies should have important inputs for marketers  and policy-makers. PUPIL DILATION Eye pupils have been shown to dilate in response to autonomic activity in  the nervous system, with dilations ranging from 1.5 to over 9.0 millimeters. While pupil  dilations have been used in a number of psychophysical experiments (see Goldwater, 1972,  for a review), applications in consumer behavior have been limited and largely  unsuccessful. Edgar Hess and others (Hess, 1965; Krugman, 1965) have employed pupil  dilations as a measure of consumer affect to advertising. The pupils were thought to  dilate in response to pleasant stimuli and contract when viewing unpleasant stimuli.  Subsequent studies (Woodmansee, 1965) have found no direct relationship between pupil  dilations and affect. King (1972) used pupil size and eye direction of models depicted in  advertisements as an independent variable in ad copy effectiveness study. While King's  manipulations were significant, the experiment does not provide insights on the use of subject  pupil dilation as a dependent variable in consumer behavior. Meanwhile, psychophysiology experiments were establishing pupil dilation  as a measure of the subjects' mental effort expended in cognitive tasks. Hess and Polt  (1964) found that peak dilations of subjects was related to the difficulty of arithmetic  tasks. Kahneman and Beatty (1966) confirmed the findings of Hess and Polt in a  different application, short-term memory tasks. Subjects' pupil size was sensitive to the  amount of information being processed. The researchers proposed that variations of pupil  size resulted from rehearsing a series of digits or words that would later have to be  recalled. Beatty and Kahneman (1966) applied similar pupil size measurements in  tasks involving "more permanent" memory. Processing stages were observed in the  experimental task, with peak dilations immediately following the presentation of the  experimental task, and a return to normal pupil size after the stimulus was reported by  the subject. Due to the wider range of dilations observed, the researchers concluded that  longer-term memory tasks required greater mental effort than activities utilizing  short-term memory. The subject's range of dilations was shown to diminish following  extensive repetitions of a simple task, showing that learning can reduce cognitive  demands. The above studies and others cited in Goldwater (1972, p. 345) have  provided support for the notion that pupil dilations reflect mental effort or activity. If  mental activity could be equated with importance of the stimulus to the individual,  pupil dilations would be a valuable addition to existing process-tracing methods in  consumer behavior. But there are several apparent drawbacks:   * Although mental activity has important associations with importance, the      relationship is not complete. For example, an unimportant stimulus could evoke substantial      mental activity if it was difficult to perceive and understand. The reverse may also be      true. An important stimulus might require little mental activity if it was already      well-learned by the subject through prior repetition. * Pupil dilation measures simply reflect mental activity. In themselves,      no clue is provided as to what is being processed, but rather that processing is      taking place. Subject protocols would also be required if the researcher wants to measure      the meaning, as well as the amount, of mental activity.   One application of pupil dilation to consumer behavior does not require  the effort-importance link. Public policy is concerned with optimum product information  presentation to consumers. Pupil dilation measures could indicate the relative difficulty  consumers experience in understanding different information presentation formats. DESIGN PROBLEMS IN EXPERIMENTS EMPLOYING PUPIL DILATION MEASURES Like all other physiological measures, pupil dilations are subject to a  variety of distortions and interpretation problems. Tryon (1975) discusses twenty-three  sources of pupil size variation, with no indication that the listing is complete. The  following considerations are of particular importance:   * The light reflex is the strongest determinant of pupil size. Significant      variations in the lighting used for the experiment would render the dilation results      meaningless. As a pre-measure, the subject's pupil dilation should be measured under      standard light changes. * Subject factors such as age, pupil unrest (hippus), drowsiness,      alertness, arousal, and physical measures such as heart rate and blood pressure have      demonstrated effects on dilation. The experimenter must consider these factors in subject      selection, and monitor physical signs during the experiment to aid in the interpretation      of results.     * It is suggested that dilation experiments be conducted at roughly the      same time of day, using subjects with the same number of hours sleep. The experimental      sessions should be as brief as possible to control for subject habituation to the task. * The amount of incentive, the degree of motor or verbal response      required, and the information load resulting from the instructions to the subject should      be held constant. * The lid closure (blinking) reflex results in a momentary pupil      contraction followed by a dilation. The subject should be told when to blink to control      for the distortion of results.   Woodmansee (1966) states that a delayed dilation response to a stimulus  may change the baseline for measuring the pupillary effects of the next stimulus. Clearly,  a separation between stimulus presentation must be maintained if the response to each  stimulus is to be measured. Simpson and Paivio (1968) have found that dilation effects are increased  if motor responses or verbal protocols are required concurrent with the stimulus  presentation. Unless the experimenter wishes to measure the total dilation for all  activities or has a proven method of partialling out these effects, any motor or verbal  activity should be separated from stimulus presentation. In summary, effective use of pupil dilation measures in a consumer  behavior experiment involving visual stimuli should include:   * A constant light source. Videotape monitors or a cathode ray tube (CRT)      device would be effective for this purpose, since both permit contrast adjustments to a      mid-range of illumination. * Consistent presentation formats for visual stimuli. Typed pages or      transparencies would be acceptable, if the same order and organization is used for all      stimuli. * Separation of presentation and response, so that the individual dilation      effects can be measured. Intervals allowing for return of pupils to baseline levels would      aid in the interpretation of results. * Control of subject factors prior to and during the experiment. Careful      selection of a reasonably homogenous subject group, and proper instructions as to desired      eye fixations and blinking are essential.   A high degree of equipment sensitivity is required for proper monitoring  of pupil dilations. Beatty and Kahneman (1966) observed average pupil size changes of 1.1  millimeters or less in their cognitive load studies. Pupil magnification would help to  correct, but not eliminate, the problem of minute measurement. Proper monitoring of pupil dilation also requires measurement. Several  types of pupillometers, commercial devices that measure pupil size, are suitable for pupil  dilation experiments. Pupillometers are available that record pupil size from 20 to 30  times per second, a measurement frequency used in current physiological experiments. One  manufacturer produces a device that simultaneously measures eye fixation and pupil  dilations. A dedicated computer is required to consolidate the idea produced by the  dilation experiment. Several technical computers can be used in conjunction with a  pupillometer, and are capable of presenting experimental output in a variety of forms  ranging from raw data on pupil size to computer-plotted graphs. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF PUPIL DILATION IN CONSUMER RESEARCH Several applications of pupil dilation in consumer behavior experiments  are proposed as examples of the potential utility of the measure:   * As a measure of mental activity associated with subject's cognitive      responses to persuasive messages (Wright, 1973).     * As a processing effort measure associated with verbal protocols. Subject      reports of their processing activity can be associated with pupil dilations on an      "on-line" basis (Payne and Ragsdale, 1978) or in the form of a "prompted      protocol," where the subject verbalizes his/ her thoughts relative to a previous task      (Russo and Rosen, 1975). * As a mental activity measure associated with successive fixations in eye      movement analysis (Russo, 1978).   These applications are tentative at best, with a host of experimental  design questions yet to be solved. DISCUSSION Although pupil dilation measures have potential value in consumer  research, limitations of the method are also apparent. Measurement of pupil size is an  exacting science, and few researchers can afford the equipment required. Even with the  most sophisticated devices, experimental conditions would have to be exceedingly precise  to avoid confounding the dilation results. Verbal stimuli are preferred to visual  presentations in order to avoid light reflex effects. Obtrusive measurement of pupil size is not considered to be a  problem, since pupil dilations are veridical representations of mental activity. But pupil  dilation measures are totally impractical in any setting but the laboratory, restricting  their research applications to lab experiments. Most researchers, therefore, will probably settle for  "second-best" measures of importance and mental activity, or beg the question  entirely. Still, the potential benefits of pupil dilation measures might warrant further  feasibility studies in consumer research.

 There are many routine treatments for foot problems, from anti-inflammatory pills to cortisone injections, to a million different pads, cushions, ointments and, of course, surgery. All of these have temporary, pain-relieving effects. But, if you want the chance to permanently solve the problem, you must change the way your feet function on the ground. And the only way to do that is to use a true custom, biomechanical orthotic: Sole Supports.






Sole Supports are Full Contact foot orthotics.  Since sole supports are custom fit to the patient's feet, they maintain constant contact with the bottom of the patient's feet, and provide total support.
Do your orthotics do that?





There are two basic states of the foot that should be very familiar: arch up and arch down. The arch down state happens when, after the heel strikes the ground, the foot unwinds inside and the arch does a free fall due to gravity. Most people are able to do this so well they overdo it. More on this later.





Are you a sports minded person, or just physically fit?  Sole Supports foot orthotics are in use by sports figures around the world.  Ask your Sole Supports provider for our athletic fitted orthotics, or call Sole Supports and ask to talk with our Athletic Orthotics Sales Representative.
