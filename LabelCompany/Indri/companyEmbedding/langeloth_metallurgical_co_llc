����� For over 20 years, Langeloth has processed nickel, copper, cobalt, tungsten� and other metal bearing materials as feedstocks in Nichols-Hershoff roasters. This environmentally sound roasting practice produces a concentrated metal oxide that can be used directly in the Metallurgical Industry or as a substitute for newly mined metals in a smelter.
 
����� Feedstocks are off loaded into a dedicated building where processing begins. Feedstocks can be processed individually or blended for a specific roaster. All feedstocks report as product, resulting in no waste products.

Tech Oxide Datasheet




















� Technical-grade molybdenum trioxide (tech oxide) is the principal molybdenum product. It is the primary product used for adding molybdenum to steel. In addition, all other molybdenum products, such as pure molybdenum trioxide and ferromolybdenum, start as technical molybdic oxide.
 
� All SO2 released through the production of molybdic oxide is processed through our Monsanto� Sulfuric Acid Plant and recovered as 66� B� sulfuric acid.






















Technical molybdic oxide comes packaged in the following ways: 
 
� 20 lb or 10 kg contained Mo cans.
� 250 lb net, 500 lb net or 400 lb contained Mo in steel drums.
� 200 to 400 kg in steel drums.
� Bulk bags ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 lbs.

About Us






















 
Langeloth Metallurgical Company (�LMC�) has a long history of producing high quality metallurgical products. In 1986 LMC began processing a wide range of metal-bearing materials, such as spent catalysts, filter cakes and grindings, as ingredients to make a product without reclamation. The products are sold directly in the steel industry or as a substitute for newly mined metals in a smelter. This activity has become a core business for LMC, which now serves the chemical, food processing, metallurgical and metals finishing industry sectors as a reliable processor of recycled metal-bearing materials.
LMC has six multi-hearth furnaces that can operate at various temperatures up to 1400 �F and are equipped with state-of-the-art air pollution control devices. This provides flexibility in processing various metal-bearing materials. All feedstocks report as product, resulting in no waste products.

Concentrated ore (MoS2) , containing over 90% molybdenite, is converted to technical grade molybdic oxide (MoO3). The finished product contains less than 0.1% sulfur. 






















Technical Oxide����������� ���������������� 
































































Pure Oxide is made from tech oxide in an electric furnace. Enough heat is added to sublime the technical grade molybdic oxide. 


















Pure Oxide






























































Technical grade molybdic oxide is mixed with a binder (either ammonia or carbon) and pressed into pillow briquettes, 1 1/2" x 1" x 3/4". 






















Technical Oxide�Briquettes
































































Langeloth Metallurgical Company uses molybdic oxide, ferrosilicon, aluminum, millscale, and some fluxing agents to produce a 60%/40% molybdenum/ferro alloy via a silicothermic reaction. 






















Ferromolybdenum������� 
































































Concentrated ore is subjected to additional processing in order to produce a lubricant grade molybdenum disulfide (99% MoS2).

	General
Largest 
	ferromolybdenum producer.
    First site to commercially convert molybdenite concentrates to technical 
	molybdic oxide.
    First site to produce pure molybdic oxide by sublimation.
	Langeloth Metallurgical Company (“LMC”) has a long history of producing high 
	quality metallurgical products. In 1986 LMC began processing a wide range of 
	metal-bearing materials, such as spent catalysts, filter cakes and 
	grindings, as ingredients to make a product without reclamation. The 
	products are sold directly in the steel industry or as a substitute for 
	newly mined metals in a smelter. This activity has become a core business 
	for LMC, which now serves the chemical, food processing, metallurgical and 
	metals finishing industry sectors as a reliable processor of recycled 
	metal-bearing materials.
LMC has six multi-hearth furnaces that can 
	operate at various temperatures up to 1400 °F and are equipped with 
	state-of-the-art air pollution control devices. This provides flexibility in 
	processing various metal-bearing materials. All feedstocks report as 
	product, resulting in no waste products.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
