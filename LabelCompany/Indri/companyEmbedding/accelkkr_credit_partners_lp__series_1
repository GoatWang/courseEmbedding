Accel-KKR Closes Its Fifth Buyout Fund with over $1.3 Billion in Committed Capital

MENLO PARK, Calif., Sept. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Accel-KKR, a technology-focused private equity investment firm, today announced the official close of its fifth buyout fund with $1.3 billion in committed capital.  The fund, Accel-KKR Capital Partners V LP ("Fund V"), will continue Accel-KKR's long-term focused strategy of investing in lower-middle market and middle-market software and IT-enabled services companies.
Accel-KKR said the fund received strong support from its investors in prior funds, as well as attracted a number of new investors.  Commenting on the fund closing, Tom Barnds, Managing Director of Accel-KKR, said, "We are heartened by the support we received from our existing investors, and are quite pleased to welcome a number of new investors to the fund.  The missions of our investors, who include leading academic institutions, medical research foundations, health care institutions, and corporate and government pensions, resonate deeply with the Accel-KKR team."
The firm formally went to market with Fund V in Spring 2015 and closed on its hard cap earlier this month.  This brings Accel-KKR's total committed capital to $4.0 billion across its current and previous funds.
The new fund includes a $100 million commitment from the firm's general partners.  "We believe in strong alignment of interest with our limited partners," commented Rob Palumbo, Managing Director of Accel-KKR. "One of the many ways we seek to achieve this alignment is by making very significant financial commitments to invest alongside of our limited partners."  The $100 million commitment represents the largest such general partner commitment in the firm's history and also makes the general partner the largest investor in the fund.
Accel-KKR invests through two different types of funds – its Buyout funds for majority ownership positions and its Growth Capital funds for minority ownership positions.  Accel-KKR raised its second Growth Capital Fund in 2014 with $350 million of committed capital.  Fund V also follows the firm's fourth buyout fund, which it started investing out of in 2013 with $800 million of commitments.
The firm has continued to expand its investment efforts outside of North America.  In 2013, it opened a London office, and since 2013 the firm and its portfolio companies have acquired or invested in over eight technology companies in Europe.  Accel-KKR has also expanded its investor base outside the United States, such that in Fund V over one third of the committed capital is from international investors.  International investments continue to be an integral part of the firm's strategy going forward.
The close of Fund V also comes amidst a period of significant activity for Accel-KKR, in terms of new investments, add-on acquisitions by portfolio companies and realizations of investments.

Recent new platform investments include:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
Motor Vehicle Software Corporation (MVSC) – Based in Agoura Hills, CA, MVSC provides innovative process management software for state government agencies and businesses including an electronic vehicle registration solution. 
Banker's Toolbox – Based in Austin, TX, Banker's Toolbox is a leading provider of Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering compliance and fraud prevention solutions for the financial industry.
Five Accel-KKR portfolio companies made add-on acquisitions over the last several months, including:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
Oildex, a leader provided of revenue and expense management software to the oil and gas market, acquired the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) business of Automatic Data Processing. 
HighJump, a global provider of supply chain management solutions, acquired Wesupply, a United Kingdom-based provider of supplier enablement and B2B integration solutions. 
MEA|NEA, the leader in secure health information exchange for medical and dental providers, acquired The White Stone Group, Inc., a provider of healthcare communication management solutions. 
Kerridge Commercial Systems, a global provider of enterprise resource planning software to the distributive trades, acquired Dancik International, a provider of software to the flooring and tiling industries. 
Datapipe, a global leader in managed hybrid IT solutions for the enterprise, acquired DualSpark, an Amazon Web Services assessment, automation, and migration company.
Accel-KKR has achieved a series of successful exits recently including:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
RiseSmart, the leading provider of contemporary career transition services, which was acquired by Randstad Holding nv. 
On Center Software, a leading construction automation technology company, which was acquired by Roper Technologies. 
Applied Predictive Technologies, a leading cloud-based analytics provider, which was acquired by MasterCard for $600 million.
About Accel-KKR Accel-KKR is a technology-focused investment firm with $4.0 billion in capital commitments to its current funds.  The firm invests primarily in software and IT-enabled businesses well-positioned for topline and bottom-line growth. At the core of Accel-KKR's investment strategy is a commitment to developing strong partnerships with the management teams of its portfolio companies and a focus on building value through significant resources available through the Accel-KKR network. Accel-KKR focuses on middle-market companies and provides a broad range of capital solutions from minority-growth investments to buyouts, recapitalizations, divisional carve-outs and going-private transactions.

Discover How to Buy a Business with Little to None of Your Own Money! 


Learn how you can get 100% funding to buy a business. Not like real estate investing or stock trading, but the business of your dreams — like a coffee shop, hair salon, spa,  retail store, auto shop, liquor store, restaurant, sports bar, etc.






 



93% of small business funding is rejected by banks. Banks overwhelmingly say “No” to small business loan requests. However, just because a bank won’t fund a deal doesn’t mean there is no startup business funding or business credit available for that deal. Since 2003, Ed Keels and his staff at Beyond Breakeven, Inc. (BBI) have been helping people with deal structures that provide business funding and business credit when banks won’t. In fact, BBI has developed more than 100 ways to fund a business acquisition or startup and do so with little to none of the buyer’s own money.

History[edit]
The firm was founded in February 2000 as a partnership between venture capital firm Accel Partners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, one of the oldest and largest leveraged buyout firms.[1] However, the firm operates independently of either firm since the mid-2000s. The firm's Founding Partner is Tom Barnds, who is based in Menlo Park. Tom, and his co-Managing Partner Rob Palumbo, were both All-American lacrosse players at Princeton University.
Accel-KKR raised $4 billion of investor commitments. The company is currently[2] investing from its fifth buyout fund (Accel-KKR Capital Partners V), a $1.3 billion fund raised in 2015, and its second minority equity fund (Accel-KKR Growth Capital Partners II), a $350 million fund raised in 2013. Accel-KKR has invested in or acquired over 100 software and technology-enabled services companies, with the majority of such companies in the United States, but Accel-KKR has also acquired or invested in 18 European companies, six Canadian companies, and one Australian company.

History[edit]
The firm was founded in February 2000 as a partnership between venture capital firm Accel Partners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, one of the oldest and largest leveraged buyout firms.[1] However, the firm operates independently of either firm since the mid-2000s. The firm's Founding Partner is Tom Barnds, who is based in Menlo Park. Tom, and his co-Managing Partner Rob Palumbo, were both All-American lacrosse players at Princeton University.
Accel-KKR raised $4 billion of investor commitments. The company is currently[2] investing from its fifth buyout fund (Accel-KKR Capital Partners V), a $1.3 billion fund raised in 2015, and its second minority equity fund (Accel-KKR Growth Capital Partners II), a $350 million fund raised in 2013. Accel-KKR has invested in or acquired over 100 software and technology-enabled services companies, with the majority of such companies in the United States, but Accel-KKR has also acquired or invested in 18 European companies, six Canadian companies, and one Australian company.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
