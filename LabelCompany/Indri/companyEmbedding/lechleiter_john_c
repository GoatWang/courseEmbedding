Lilly Announces Promotion of John C. Lechleiter to President and Chief Operating Officer
Lechleiter will also join company's board of directors 
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept 20, 2005 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., has been promoted to president and chief operating officer (COO) of the company and will also join the company's board of directors.  Lechleiter will assume his new responsibilities effective October 1, 2005, and will continue to report directly to Chairman and CEO Sidney Taurel. "This promotion reflects John's strong leadership in a series of challenging roles, his absolute commitment to putting patients first, and his deep connections with people inside and outside the company," Taurel said. "John's energy, passion, and resolve will continue to be critical assets as we work to take full advantage of our expanded product line in a cost-conscious, competitive global marketplace."  Taurel added, "This new leadership structure, which provides a balance of both strategic and operational focus, is right for this time of rapid change.  We want to be sure that our leadership team is in the best position to help people throughout the company deliver for the customer now and in the future.  John's new role is an important step in making that happen." Lechleiter earned his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Harvard University and he joined Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist.  His experiences include roles in pharmaceutical product development, project management and regulatory affairs.  He was appointed senior vice president, pharmaceutical products in 1998.  He was promoted to executive vice president of pharmaceutical products and corporate development in 2001, assumed the role of executive vice president of pharmaceutical operations in early 2004, and then took the added responsibility for the company's U.S. operations later in 2004. "I am honored and excited to have this opportunity to serve a company like Lilly -- a company whose values I share and whose people I respect," said Lechleiter.  "I am anxious to lead our efforts in this new capacity, and to ensure that all of our stakeholders -- our customers, shareholders, partners, and colleagues -- benefit from our terrific product portfolio." Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with eminent scientific organizations.  Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind., Lilly provides answers -- through medicines and information -- for some of the world's most urgent medical needs.

« Previous Release | Next Release »



John C. Lechleiter to Retire as Lilly CEO; Board Elects David A. Ricks as Successor
- Ricks will assume President and CEO roles on January 1, 2017, and become chairman of Lilly's board on June 1, 2017- Lechleiter will continue as chairman through May 2017


INDIANAPOLIS, July 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president and chief executive officer, will retire as president and CEO and from the company effective December 31, 2016.  Lechleiter will continue on Lilly's board of directors until May 31, 2017, serving as non-executive chairman, at which time he will leave the board.  Lilly's board of directors unanimously elected David A. Ricks, currently senior vice president and president, Lilly Bio-Medicines, to assume the role of president and chief executive officer and to join the board on January 1, 
2017, and to become chairman of the board on June 1, 2017.
"As Lilly transitions from our recent challenging period of patent expirations to a new era of growth, it is the logical time for a transition in company leadership," Lechleiter said.  "Dave Ricks is a capable, decisive and energetic leader who is very well prepared to succeed me as CEO.  He brings to the role broad experience in Lilly's commercial operations along with an appreciation and understanding of research and development.  He previously led Lilly's business operations in Canada, China, and the U.S.  Since 2012, he has successfully guided Lilly's largest business area, Lilly Bio-Medicines, through a period of profound change.  He is well respected inside and outside the company, consistently builds exceptional teams, and sets high standards of performance.  Dave is well suited to 
help Lilly capitalize on the opportunities before it, as well as to confront the inevitable challenges that lie ahead.  He will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years." 
Reflecting on his tenure as Lilly's top leader, Lechleiter said, "It has been a distinct honor and a privilege to serve this great company as its CEO these past eight years. I wish to thank all of my Lilly colleagues for their unfailing support as well as their extraordinary efforts throughout this period."
Lechleiter has been the company's CEO since April 1, 2008, and the chairman of its board of directors since January 1, 2009.  He joined Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist in process research and development.  In the mid-1980s he served as director of pharmaceutical product development for the Lilly Research Centre Limited in England.  He later held roles in project management, regulatory affairs, product development, and pharma operations.  In 2005, he was named president and chief operating officer and joined the board of directors.
"The prospect of leading Eli Lilly and Company is at the same time humbling and tremendously exciting," said Ricks.  "Patients, physicians, health-care payers, and society as a whole expect a great deal from us.  Together with my Lilly colleagues around the world, I look forward to meeting these expectations and, whenever we can, exceeding them.
"Lilly has the right strategy.  We've built a strong pipeline and have a promising portfolio of recently approved new medicines.  Navigating major patent expirations in recent years, we've sharpened our focus and improved our vigilance and agility," Ricks continued.  "Now, we must realize our growth potential in an increasingly challenging global marketplace.  We must focus on delivering better and better medicines to the patients who need them, and in so doing, benefit our employees, communities, and shareholders alike."
Ricks' successor as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines will be announced at a later date.
Since January 2012, Ricks has served as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, which encompasses the therapeutic areas of Alzheimer's disease, urology, immunology, musculoskeletal disease, and pain, as well as the company's global marketing function.  Ricks serves on the board of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and has served as co-chair of the Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue.
After joining Lilly in 1996 as a business development associate, Ricks held several management roles in U.S. marketing and sales before moving to Lilly Canada, where he served successively as director of pharmaceutical marketing, national sales director, and general manager.  He was subsequently named president and general manager of Lilly China before becoming president of Lilly USA in 2009. 
Ricks earned a bachelor's degree in business from Purdue University and joined Lilly following completion of his MBA from Indiana University.  He chairs the Board of Governors for the Riley Children's Foundation and in 2015 chaired the United Way of Central Indiana's annual campaign.  Ricks also sits on the executive board of the Crossroads of America Council of Boy Scouts of America, and on the Advisory Board of the Purdue University Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. 
Said Ellen Marram, president of The Barnegat Group and Lilly's lead independent director: "On behalf of Lilly's entire board of directors, I want to thank John for his strong and steady leadership, and his commitment to the company's values of integrity, excellence, and respect for people during one of the most difficult and challenging periods in Lilly's 140-year history.  John demonstrated the courage to make important and necessary changes in the company, and, despite near-term financial pressures, he invested robustly in R&D and maintained constant focus on leadership development.  As a result, Lilly today is in a position of strength, with excellent prospects for the future based on recent and anticipated new product launches."
Marram continued: "Following a thorough and rigorous process, the board is pleased to select Dave Ricks to succeed John.  In nearly five years as president of Lilly's Bio-Medicines business, Dave has demonstrated the ability to successfully lead a large global organization engaged in all facets of our business.  His experience in the areas of product development, global sales and marketing as well as public policy will ensure continuity and will enable him to lead the company in an ever more complex environment going forward."
Lilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world.  We were founded more than a century ago by a man committed to creating high-quality medicines that meet real needs, and today we remain true to that mission in all our work.  Across the globe, Lilly employees work to discover and bring life-changing medicines to those who need them, improve the understanding and management of disease, and give back to communities through philanthropy and volunteerism.  To learn more about Lilly, please visit us at www.lilly.com and newsroom.lilly.com/social-channels.

Patents Ending, Eli Lilly Chases New Drugs

INDIANAPOLIS  —  John C. Lechleiter walks a mile to work every morning to think about the day ahead. He walks home in the evening, he says, “to try to forget about it.”These are challenging times for Eli Lilly, the company he leads. It is losing patent protection in the next seven years on drugs that accounted for 74 percent of its sales in 2009, a decline considered to be the worst patent cliff facing  major companies in the industry.And it also had been hit by recent legal, regulatory and research disappointments, including the surprise announcement in August that a promising  experimental drug treatment for Alzheimer’s  was being dropped because it  hurt patients’ cognitive functions more than it helped.As a result of the compound issues confronting the company, analysts and others have been pressuring Lilly to undergo major transformations similar to those of its rivals Pfizer and Merck, which made giant purchases of other companies in efforts to diversify and spur growth.

For Lilly and Dr. Lechleiter, the company’s fortunes are not all that is at stake. Its economic health is closely  interwoven with its hometown roots here, where it also works with about 3,000 Indiana businesses. Continue reading the main story

Dr. Lechleiter, a chemist who joined Lilly 31 years ago and was named chief executive in 2008, remains  confident of the company’s strategy. He asserts that it can retool  with in-house research and cost-cutting, rather than resorting to mergers or big acquisitions.In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Dr. Lechleiter held to the company’s promise that revenue would not dip below $20 billion even in the expected low-tide year of 2014. He said efforts to trim $1 billion in costs and 5,500 employees by the end of 2011 were on track.And he pointed to the potential for new drugs and pending decisions by the Food and Drug Administration that might expand the markets for existing Lilly drugs.“We’ll see our way through the storm,” he said. “At a time when others say Lilly has to do a deal or Lilly has to go outside itself to solve its problems, we’re resolutely focused on what we have to do inside the company to make the innovative medicines that are at the core of value creation for Lilly and patients. That’s what we do.”Long a powerhouse for psychiatric drugs like Prozac, Zyprexa and Cymbalta, Lilly is looking to new drug opportunities in treating cancer and Alzheimer’s, two diseases that Mr. Lechleiter said will become more pressing as Americans live longer.Some analysts do not share his optimism, and point to a lack of promising products in the company’s short-term outlook.  For example, Lilly has introduced only one product in the last five years, the blood thinner Effient, to sluggish early sales. It has virtually no new products to market until 2013, when it hopes to start rolling out two a year.The patent losses are daunting: Its schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, whose $4.92 billion in sales last year represented 23 percent of the company’s total, goes off patent a year from now. Cymbalta, with $3.07 billion in sales, loses patent protection in 2013. In addition, Lilly lost legal challenges this year to Gemzar, a cancer drug that sold $1.36 billion, and Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that sold $609 million.

J. P. Morgan last week predicted Lilly would face “a prolonged period of depressed earnings” with sales dipping to $18.6 billion in 2015 from a peak of $23 billion in 2010.C . Anthony Butler of Barclays Capital called for Lilly to make some drastic changes, predicting that its revenue could drop to $18.8 billion in 2015. “I’m not sure what would drive the going-back-up part,” he said in an interview.He also cited the company’s longtime relationship to Indianapolis as an impediment to taking measures like slashing costs to preserve its margins and dividends.  “I worry that they can’t do that because they’re too ingrained in the fabric of the community,” Mr. Butler said.

Indeed, since its founding here in 1876, Lilly has become the city’s largest private employer. Mayor Greg Ballard’s father worked there for 33 years; the former mayor, Bart Peterson, works there now; and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels spent eight years on the Lilly campus.Indianapolis, a city of about 800,000, is undergoing a tax-supported, $3.3 billion downtown building boom as it gears up to host the 2012 Super Bowl. On Monday, the city, company and a developer announced plans to develop one corner of a sprawling Lilly parking lot into a $150 million hotel, apartment, retail and restaurant complex.“A recruiting magnet,” Dr.  Lechleiter said as he walked through the lot, pulling a small wheeled suitcase filled with paperwork, on the way to work.

He walks, he said, for exercise and time to reflect. Dr. Lechleiter said he has accepted a ride only once, in a snowstorm, in the four years since he and his wife moved closer to work, living in a penthouse in a downtown luxury hotel.As he passed through the lobby and hallways, he greeted a dozen employees by their first names before settling in his small corner office.With a salary of  $15.9 million, he has asked the board to freeze his  pay “in light of the business challenges the company currently faces,” according to Lilly’s annual report. Derica W. Rice, the company’s chief financial officer, said Lilly  has cut 2,100 jobs in the last year.

On the research front, Lilly is bucking a trend among a few competitors, which have decided to shift significant resources away from in-house development.Just last week, Dr. Andrew Baum, a Morgan Stanley analyst,  suggested  at a forum in New York  the industry giants would be better off abandoning research and buying others’. Licensing, he calculated, would yield three times the returns with less risk.Mr. Baum said he expected the large European pharmaceutical companies to cut their research spending by about 40 percent in the next two years after a decade of dismal returns.Lilly does not intend to take that path.  Jan M. Lundberg, hired from AstraZeneca in January to lead Lilly Research Laboratories, said, “We don’t change our research based on quarterly earnings. It’s a long-term theme.”Mr. Butler said Lilly has the industry’s highest ratio of research to revenue  —  19.8 percent of $21.8 billion sales last year, or $4.3 billion, compared with 15.6 percent at Pfizer, which reported $7.8 billion research spending and $50 billion revenue. Biotechnology products account for about 40 percent of the 70 molecules in Lilly’s pipeline.In a medium-size deal, its biggest purchase ever, Lilly bought ImClone Systems for $6.5 billion in 2008. On Tuesday, in New York, Lilly announced that about 140 cancer researchers from ImClone were starting to work in a new life sciences complex near Bellevue Hospital and NYU Langone Medical Center.But its best prospects in the next few years  are modifications of existing product lines. Its most promising new product is Bydureon, a long-acting form of the diabetes drug Byetta, according to Seamus Fernandez of the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. Bydureon, developed with Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Alkermes, is injected once a week instead of twice a day. Mr. Butler said sales estimates range from $1 billion to $6 billion.  The F.D.A. target decision date is Oct. 22.Lilly also hopes to expand Cymbalta, approved to treat major depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia, into chronic pain. That is under review by the F.D.A.

“We’re hopefully at the final stages of negotiating that new indication for Cymbalta in the area of chronic pain,” Dr. Lechleiter said. And Lilly plans to apply next quarter for approval of the impotence drug Cialis to treat enlarged prostate, he added.Lilly has been through this doubt and uncertainty before. A decade ago, it lost the patent on Prozac two years earlier than expected. Within four years, it had nine new drugs on the market.“We’re trying to be realistic,” Dr. Lechleiter  said, “while maintaining a sense of optimism.”

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
John C. Lechleiter was born in Louisville, Kentucky,[8] on August 17, 1952. He is the eldest of nine children of Jeanne and John H. Lechleiter.[8][9]
Lechleiter first participated in laboratory research in a summer research program at the University of Minnesota in 1974.[7] Lechleiter received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Xavier University in 1975.[4] He went on to receive a master's degree and a PhD in organic chemistry from Harvard University in 1980 after studying on a National Science Foundation Fellowship.[10] His thesis advisor was Dr. Paul A. Wender.[8]
John C. Lechleiter and his wife Sarah live in Indianapolis, Indiana, have three children, Andrew, Daniel and Elizabeth, and now several grandchildren.[8]
Career[edit]
Lechleiter joined Eli Lilly and company in 1979 as senior organic chemist.[1][2][3][5][7] From 1984 to 1986, he served as director of pharmaceutical product development at the Lilly Research Centre Limited in Windlesham, England.[1][2][3] In 1986, he returned to the US as manager of research and development projects for Europe.[1][2][3] He became Director of development projects management in 1988, Executive Director of pharmaceutical product development in 1991, Vice President of pharmaceutical product development in 1993, and Vice President of regulatory affairs in 1994. Lechleiter became Vice President for development and regulatory affairs in 1996, and Senior Vice President of pharmaceutical products in 1998.[1][2][3] In 2001, he was appointed Executive Vice President for pharmaceutical products and corporate development.[1][2][3] In a 2003 e-mail, he discussed the use of the anti-schizophrenia or bipolar disorder drug Zyprexa for "disruptive kids",(an "off-label" use, for which drug manufacturers are not legally permitted to encourage) even if it was not approved by federal regulators because it could lead to diabetes.“The fact we are now talking to child psychs and peds and others about Strattera means that we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population."[11] In 2004, he became Executive Vice President for pharmaceutical operations.[1][2][3]
John Lechleiter served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer beginning in October 2005. He also joined Lilly's Board of Directors at that time. Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s president and chief executive officer (CEO), effective April 1, 2008.[1][2][3][5][6] Effective January 1, 2009, Lechleiter was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eli Lilly and Company, succeeding Sidney Taurel.[12] In 2012, he earned US$15.57 million.[4] He is credited with successfully guiding the company through a difficult period in which patent protection expired for four of its main products (Gemzar, Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista), and for establishing a promising pipeline of possible new drugs.[13] His advice to others is "We like to move quickly, but the most important thing is to be patient, resolute, and be guided by the data."[14]
Lechleiter is a member of the American Chemical Society, the Business Roundtable and The Business Council.[1][2][3] He is Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and President of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations.[5] Lechleiter is on the Boards of Directors of Nike, Inc. (from 2009),[6][15] the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership[16] and the Great Lakes Chemical Corporation.[17]
He has served on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Xavier University, for a three-year term beginning in September 2004,[18] and on the board of the Life Sciences Foundation.[19] He serves as a distinguished advisor to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.[12][20] In 2014 he became chairman of United Way Worldwide,[21] which Lilly has supported for many years through both corporate giving and volunteerism.[22] Lilly employees are encouraged to participate in the Lilly Global Day of Service, an internationally observed day of charitable work in their communities. Lechleiter began the initiative in 2008, the year that he became CEO.[8][23][24] Lechleiter has identified poor K-12 and STEM education as "this country's Achilles' heel",[7] and the Lechleiter family has contributed towards K-12 education via the Catholic Education Foundation of Louisville.[9]
Awards and honors[edit]
He has received Honorary Doctorates from Marian University (2006), the University of Indianapolis (2012), and the National University of Ireland (2012).[1][3][8]
In 2012, he was awarded the inaugural Global Health Partner Award from Project HOPE.[25][26]
In 2014, he was named as the August M. Watanabe Life Sciences Champion of the Year for his work in supporting the development of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute.[19]
In 2015, he received the 2015 International Citizen of the Year Award from the International Center of Indianapolis, Indiana.[27]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
John C. Lechleiter was born in Louisville, Kentucky,[8] on August 17, 1952. He is the eldest of nine children of Jeanne and John H. Lechleiter.[8][9]
Lechleiter first participated in laboratory research in a summer research program at the University of Minnesota in 1974.[7] Lechleiter received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Xavier University in 1975.[4] He went on to receive a master's degree and a PhD in organic chemistry from Harvard University in 1980 after studying on a National Science Foundation Fellowship.[10] His thesis advisor was Dr. Paul A. Wender.[8]
John C. Lechleiter and his wife Sarah live in Indianapolis, Indiana, have three children, Andrew, Daniel and Elizabeth, and now several grandchildren.[8]
Career[edit]
Lechleiter joined Eli Lilly and company in 1979 as senior organic chemist.[1][2][3][5][7] From 1984 to 1986, he served as director of pharmaceutical product development at the Lilly Research Centre Limited in Windlesham, England.[1][2][3] In 1986, he returned to the US as manager of research and development projects for Europe.[1][2][3] He became Director of development projects management in 1988, Executive Director of pharmaceutical product development in 1991, Vice President of pharmaceutical product development in 1993, and Vice President of regulatory affairs in 1994. Lechleiter became Vice President for development and regulatory affairs in 1996, and Senior Vice President of pharmaceutical products in 1998.[1][2][3] In 2001, he was appointed Executive Vice President for pharmaceutical products and corporate development.[1][2][3] In a 2003 e-mail, he discussed the use of the anti-schizophrenia or bipolar disorder drug Zyprexa for "disruptive kids",(an "off-label" use, for which drug manufacturers are not legally permitted to encourage) even if it was not approved by federal regulators because it could lead to diabetes.“The fact we are now talking to child psychs and peds and others about Strattera means that we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population."[11] In 2004, he became Executive Vice President for pharmaceutical operations.[1][2][3]
John Lechleiter served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer beginning in October 2005. He also joined Lilly's Board of Directors at that time. Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s president and chief executive officer (CEO), effective April 1, 2008.[1][2][3][5][6] Effective January 1, 2009, Lechleiter was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eli Lilly and Company, succeeding Sidney Taurel.[12] In 2012, he earned US$15.57 million.[4] He is credited with successfully guiding the company through a difficult period in which patent protection expired for four of its main products (Gemzar, Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista), and for establishing a promising pipeline of possible new drugs.[13] His advice to others is "We like to move quickly, but the most important thing is to be patient, resolute, and be guided by the data."[14]
Lechleiter is a member of the American Chemical Society, the Business Roundtable and The Business Council.[1][2][3] He is Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and President of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations.[5] Lechleiter is on the Boards of Directors of Nike, Inc. (from 2009),[6][15] the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership[16] and the Great Lakes Chemical Corporation.[17]
He has served on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Xavier University, for a three-year term beginning in September 2004,[18] and on the board of the Life Sciences Foundation.[19] He serves as a distinguished advisor to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.[12][20] In 2014 he became chairman of United Way Worldwide,[21] which Lilly has supported for many years through both corporate giving and volunteerism.[22] Lilly employees are encouraged to participate in the Lilly Global Day of Service, an internationally observed day of charitable work in their communities. Lechleiter began the initiative in 2008, the year that he became CEO.[8][23][24] Lechleiter has identified poor K-12 and STEM education as "this country's Achilles' heel",[7] and the Lechleiter family has contributed towards K-12 education via the Catholic Education Foundation of Louisville.[9]
Awards and honors[edit]
He has received Honorary Doctorates from Marian University (2006), the University of Indianapolis (2012), and the National University of Ireland (2012).[1][3][8]
In 2012, he was awarded the inaugural Global Health Partner Award from Project HOPE.[25][26]
In 2014, he was named as the August M. Watanabe Life Sciences Champion of the Year for his work in supporting the development of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute.[19]
In 2015, he received the 2015 International Citizen of the Year Award from the International Center of Indianapolis, Indiana.[27]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
