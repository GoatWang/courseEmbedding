Job Details
               Temple Sholom was founded in 1956 and is a member of the Union for Reform Judaism. We are a Reform congregation that is known for its warmth. We are an open congregation which has a policy and a long-standing practice of inclusion. We serve our members throughout their cycles of life; from infancy through death. Individuals are welcome regardless of their race, religion, family status or sexual orientation. We value the participation of non-Jewish partners and extended family members in the life of our congregation. Temple Sholom believes that Judaism is an exciting, creative, challenging way of life. As a religious institution, we are committed to your personal freedom to understand and choose your way, not to dictate your choice or your path. We believe that Jewish continuity is best served by providing individuals and families with opportunities to exercise their own choices in religious practice and belief. We thrive on our diversity. There isnâ€™t just one Temple Sholom personality! The heterogeneity of our membership contributes to the richness of the Temple Sholom experience and gives our congregation the feeling of being an extended family. We exist to serve our members in their religious, social, educational and community needs. Temple Sholom is here for those who want to attend worship services; for those who want a place to study; for those who simply desire opportunities for companionship. Most of the members of our over 475 households come from Delaware and Lower Montgomery Counties, with many others from the city of Philadelphia and Chester County.
