What is an Intoxalock ignition interlock
device?
An ignition interlock device is a breathalyzer that is installed in your
vehicle to prevent drinking and driving. It is made up of a mouthpiece, a
handheld unit and a cord that attaches to your vehicle’s ignition system.
You are required to blow into the mouthpiece to test your Breath Alcohol
Concentration (BrAC) before starting your car.
If your BrAC is below the limit set by your state, your
vehicle will start. If your BrAC is above your state’s limit, your vehicle
will not start until you submit a breath sample that no longer detects
alcohol.
All activity is stored in the device and sent to your monitoring
department (court, DMV, probation officer, etc.). With real-time reporting
capabilities, Intoxalock is able to upload data immediately to our Log
Reporter website. Some states require the information to be made available
immediately, while others require the data to be sent monthly.
How to use an ignition interlock device video






Step by step instructions
To use your ignition interlock device, press the button on the handheld
unit and wait until the LED displays “Blow.” Most states require you to
submit a blow, inhale, blow breath pattern into the mouthpiece. Some states
require you to just blow into the device. Check your User’s
Manual for detailed instructions.
All states require mandated retests to be submitted while the vehicle is
running. The interlock device will ask for a retest at randomly spaced time
intervals with a loud beep and a message displayed on the LED screen of the
handheld. The user must submit another breath sample each time a retest is
requested. If alcohol is detected during a retest, your ignition interlock
will not turn off your vehicle while it is in motion but it will give a
signal for you to stop.
Intoxalock device accuracy
Intoxalock uses fuel cell technology in all devices to ensure the
highest levels of accuracy and reliability. Check your state’s
requirements to see which products are approved in your state.

How much does an ignition interlock cost? An ignition interlock device costs as little as $2.15 a day and is an affordable way to prevent drunk driving. Interlock devices usually cost less than a daily cup of coffee or a fast food sandwich. Your overall price covers a variety of things that could include the device itself, a camera unit if required, mouthpieces, installation, removal, calibrations, reporting, device maintenance and more. Your total ignition interlock device cost will vary depending on a variety of factors:  The state ordering your ignition interlock device installation Additional features you are required to have (camera, GPS, real-time reporting) The length of time you are required to have an ignition interlock device installed The year, make and model of the vehicle you are installing your ignition interlock device in 
Intoxalock ignition interlock pricing
Intoxalock promises to always provide customers with the lowest prices available. With cost-saving specials like free installations and free first month leases available in many states, we are committed to making the ignition interlock process affordable. If there isn’t a current offer in your state, we are usually committed to already providing pricing much lower than other providers. Check your state for special offers.
State financial assistance for ignition interlock devices Many states offer financial assistance for customers needing an interlock that meet certain qualifications. Many times, those requirements are determined by the courts. Our state interlock specialists can help you determine if you qualify for financial aid to help cover your ignition interlock cost.
Ignition interlock devices prevent repeat drunk driving offenses
An alcohol-related driving offense (DUI, DWI, OWI) is extremely expensive. Ignition interlock devices are proven to be the most effective method at reducing repeat offenses. According to MADD, there's a 67% reduction of repeat drunk driving offenses when comparing those with an interlock device installed to those with a license suspension. Read more drunk driving facts here.
The national average cost of a DUI/DWI/OWI is around $10,000. Read more about the costs associated with a DUI. 
Monthly lease pricing and installation costs vary by state. For a free, no obligation pricing quote, call us at (888) 283-5899 or submit your information below.  Read more about ignition interlock device pricing on the Intoxalock blog.

The BDI-747[edit]
The BDI-747 is a state of the art ignition interlock device, breath-alcohol testing device approximately the size of a smartphone. The ignition interlock device requires the driver to exhale into the device prior to starting the vehicle. The device will prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver's blood-alcohol content exceeds a predetermined set level. It is the only wireless, digital, touchscreen, GPS-enabled, ignition interlock device to comply with the 2013 NHTSA guidelines.
Interlocks may be required for use by DUI or DWI ("driving under the influence" or "driving while intoxicated") offenders as part of their mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. The individual subject to the court or motor vehicle order pays for the installation/removal and monthly lease of the ignition interlock device. Blow & Drive Interlock provides services relating to monitoring of the device at predetermined intervals according to state guidelines. Data is then collected and made available to the appropriate authorities for review.
The Company's principal location is in Los Angeles County, California and has over 100 qualified personnel to install, calibrate, remove and monitor the devices across the eleven U.S. states where it has received approvals to operate. The Company's business plan includes growth of the Company by continuing to complete and submit state applications and to build up its service infrastructure by utilizing its own retail infrastructure, independent installers, distributors and franchisees.[3][8][9][10][11][12][4]
Regulatory Approvals[edit]
Blow & Drive Interlock received U.S. Federal certification from the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration to provide criminal monitoring services by means of its BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device in 2014. It has since received U.S. State approvals to provide services in conjunction with the judiciary or administrative arms in eleven states since it began formally leasing devices in 2015:[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

Recent Developments[edit]
In September 2016 Blow & Drive Interlock entered into a letter of intent with The Doheny Group to finance an expansion to quadruple the company's market share from its supply of 500 machines to 2,100 machines but then in November announced it was in fact increasing funding to expand the company’s marketshare to 2,700 machines to meet high demand. In a January 2017 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company reported that it had scaled up production and increased its inventory by approximately 75% to over 2,000 machines and was still on track to meet the 2,700 goal by the end of that fiscal quarter. The company announced it had completed production and deployment reaching this 2,700-machine goal in March 2017 as well as beginning the production process of a further additional 1,000 units, which would bring its total machine-count to 3,700.[20][21][22][23][24]
The company participated with Mothers Against Drunk Driving as a data provider in their MADD 2017 Ignition Interlock Report. The report estimated that 2.3 million attempts to drive drunk had been prevented by ignition interlock legislation since 2006. Over 350,000 driving attempts were stopped in 2016 alone. According to the National Transportation Administration's Department's Office of Behavioral Research, each of these drivers would have had an estimated 6.75x greater chance of crash risk.[25] According to MADD's report, "Every state in the nation has an ignition interlock law of some kind. MADD's goal is for every state to have the most effective ignition interlock law, which is one that applies to every drunk driver after the first offense. When MADD's Campaign started, only New Mexico had an all-offender ignition interlock law. Today, 28 states and the District of Columbia require ignition interlocks for offenders with a .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and above after the first offense. MADD is committed to working with the other 22 states to pass similar laws, and to help every state optimize its laws and expand the use of technology to stop the tragedies caused by drunk driving." [26]
In April 2017, Equities.com did a feature on Blow and Drive's expansion into the state of Texas and how the state is a key for the company as there is a huge market with high demand for its product. The article also highlighted research from Bloomberg and Forbes stating that the potential implications of MADD's proposed legislation will result in the ignition interlock industry exponentially expanding and reaching $1.1 billion to $3.2 billion as early as years 2018-2020.[27][28] The article states that Blow and Drive intends to have over 10,000 ignition interlock devices leased and generating revenue by year-end 2017. The company has increased leased units from December 2016 to March of this year by 145%.[29]

The BDI-747[edit]
The BDI-747 is a state of the art ignition interlock device, breath-alcohol testing device approximately the size of a smartphone. The ignition interlock device requires the driver to exhale into the device prior to starting the vehicle. The device will prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver's blood-alcohol content exceeds a predetermined set level. It is the only wireless, digital, touchscreen, GPS-enabled, ignition interlock device to comply with the 2013 NHTSA guidelines.
Interlocks may be required for use by DUI or DWI ("driving under the influence" or "driving while intoxicated") offenders as part of their mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. The individual subject to the court or motor vehicle order pays for the installation/removal and monthly lease of the ignition interlock device. Blow & Drive Interlock provides services relating to monitoring of the device at predetermined intervals according to state guidelines. Data is then collected and made available to the appropriate authorities for review.
The Company's principal location is in Los Angeles County, California and has over 100 qualified personnel to install, calibrate, remove and monitor the devices across the eleven U.S. states where it has received approvals to operate. The Company's business plan includes growth of the Company by continuing to complete and submit state applications and to build up its service infrastructure by utilizing its own retail infrastructure, independent installers, distributors and franchisees.[3][8][9][10][11][12][4]
Regulatory Approvals[edit]
Blow & Drive Interlock received U.S. Federal certification from the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration to provide criminal monitoring services by means of its BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device in 2014. It has since received U.S. State approvals to provide services in conjunction with the judiciary or administrative arms in eleven states since it began formally leasing devices in 2015:[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

Recent Developments[edit]
In September 2016 Blow & Drive Interlock entered into a letter of intent with The Doheny Group to finance an expansion to quadruple the company's market share from its supply of 500 machines to 2,100 machines but then in November announced it was in fact increasing funding to expand the company’s marketshare to 2,700 machines to meet high demand. In a January 2017 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company reported that it had scaled up production and increased its inventory by approximately 75% to over 2,000 machines and was still on track to meet the 2,700 goal by the end of that fiscal quarter. The company announced it had completed production and deployment reaching this 2,700-machine goal in March 2017 as well as beginning the production process of a further additional 1,000 units, which would bring its total machine-count to 3,700.[20][21][22][23][24]
The company participated with Mothers Against Drunk Driving as a data provider in their MADD 2017 Ignition Interlock Report. The report estimated that 2.3 million attempts to drive drunk had been prevented by ignition interlock legislation since 2006. Over 350,000 driving attempts were stopped in 2016 alone. According to the National Transportation Administration's Department's Office of Behavioral Research, each of these drivers would have had an estimated 6.75x greater chance of crash risk.[25] According to MADD's report, "Every state in the nation has an ignition interlock law of some kind. MADD's goal is for every state to have the most effective ignition interlock law, which is one that applies to every drunk driver after the first offense. When MADD's Campaign started, only New Mexico had an all-offender ignition interlock law. Today, 28 states and the District of Columbia require ignition interlocks for offenders with a .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and above after the first offense. MADD is committed to working with the other 22 states to pass similar laws, and to help every state optimize its laws and expand the use of technology to stop the tragedies caused by drunk driving." [26]
In April 2017, Equities.com did a feature on Blow and Drive's expansion into the state of Texas and how the state is a key for the company as there is a huge market with high demand for its product. The article also highlighted research from Bloomberg and Forbes stating that the potential implications of MADD's proposed legislation will result in the ignition interlock industry exponentially expanding and reaching $1.1 billion to $3.2 billion as early as years 2018-2020.[27][28] The article states that Blow and Drive intends to have over 10,000 ignition interlock devices leased and generating revenue by year-end 2017. The company has increased leased units from December 2016 to March of this year by 145%.[29]

Blow & Drive Interlock Corporation is a publicly traded company on the OTCQB (BDIC) and is a
provider of automotive and criminal offender monitoring security products. BDIC is making
tremendous progress because our state‐of‐the‐art ignition interlock device BDI-747 is
approved and available in 8 states for evidentiary as well as preliminary screening use. Our state
of the art BDI-747 is the most advanced user friendly IID currently available which can record BAC
levels, offers 2 way communication, GPS location technology, image technology and is
wireless.
We have begun a second run of an additional 1,000 BDI-747 to meet our high demand and prepare for major national expansion. We continue to apply for additional State Certifications and hope to have the BDI-747 available to customers nationwide. We believe our share of the global market can rise steadily. In addition, we continue to do research and development of the next stage of offender monitoring which we believe will be smartphone enabled monitoring apps that could reduce or completely eliminate the need for ankle bracelets, or hand held breathalyzers.

 Inside Scoop on Blow & Drive Interlock Corp (OTCBB:BDIC)         CLOSEHomeInsider LookSmall CapsTechnologyUplistingTrendingNewsletterMoreBecome A Contributor!Submit an ArticleAboutAdvertisingPrivacy PolicySEC DisclosureNewsletterBecome A Contributor!Submit an ArticleAdvertising       HomeInsider LookSmall CapsTechnologyUplistingTrendingNewsletterMoreBecome A Contributor!Submit an ArticleAboutAdvertisingPrivacy PolicySEC Disclosure  Inside Scoop on Blow & Drive Interlock Corp (OTCBB:BDIC)By Adam Jones -March 24, 2016Blow & Drive Interlock Corp (OTCBB:BDIC) is a lightly traded stock with a revolutionary product that is gaining traction across the United States. The company has had several announcements and developments over the last few months and the stock has yet to capture the value of these. The share price currently trades at $0.714 and is volatile due to the limited volume. The daily average volume is at 2,600 shares. The company has a goal of growing the company nationally and hitting 10,000 units of monthly reoccurring lease payments.BDIC markets distributorships and lease a breath alcohol ignition interlock device called the BDI-747/1, which is a mechanism that is installed on the steering column of an automobile and into which a driver exhales. The device in turn provides a blood-alcohol concentration analysis. If the driver’s blood-alcohol content is higher than a certain pre-programmed limit, the device prevents the ignition from engaging and the automobile from starting. These devices are often required for use by DUI or DWI (“driving under the influence” or “driving while intoxicated”) offenders as part of a mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. Forbes and Bloomberg estimate this market will reach between $1.1 Billion and $3.2 Billion a year by 2020.In recent developments, Blow & Drive Interlock Corp (OTCBB:BDIC) has entered into several definitive agreements according to SEC filings. The first was a financing agreement. The CEO has been very clear that the company will attempt in all possible manners to not take on dilutive/toxic financing. The company announced it had arranged capital financing with an interest free loan to fund production by establishing a royalty rate of $1 per unit over 800 and $5 per unit under 800. BDIC has also entered into an advertising agreement in the key target markets of OR, TN, KY, TX, OK and Northern California. The last agreement was another advertising company, RevShare, for $10k.The potential market share for Blow & Drive Interlock Corp (OTCBB:BDIC) got a boost when State of Arizona has added our wireless BDI-747 to the “Conforming Products List” of “Alcohol Devices approved for Evidentiary and preliminary screening use.” This State of Arizona approval now makes 8 states where the BDI-747 and is currently available and gives BDIC access to an additional 39,000 DUI arrestees each year.1,000 units of BDI-747 have been delivered to BDIC headquarters and are ready for installation in new client vehicles. The company is forecasting that these new IID units have the potential to generate approximately $1.2 million in gross revenue annually. The CEO stated, “Much of this revenue will go straight to the company’s bottom line. The company is already invested in establishing the infrastructure needed to build these units and put them on the road. We are now aggressively executing on our business model.”We have a Monster Pick Coming. Subscribe Right Now! NameEmail BDIC is currently trading at a $14 million market valuation. The company is gaining momentum as it ramps up production and its market share continues to grow. States are beginning to see the value of the technology at no cost to them since the DUI violator will pay for the cost. If the company reaches 10,000 units, BDIC should be making roughly $12 million annually (almost equivalent its market cap).We will be updating on BDIC when more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapspot so you know what’s going on with BDIC.Disclosure: we hold no position in BDIC either long or short at the publication of this article and we have not been compensated for this article.

The customer service I have experienced is by far the best and easiest to deal with of any company I can remember. I almost forget about the costs and aggravations from getting a DUI I have endured because everyone I speak to seems to be understanding and patient.”

What is an Intoxalock ignition interlock
device?
An ignition interlock device is a breathalyzer that is installed in your
vehicle to prevent drinking and driving. It is made up of a mouthpiece, a
handheld unit and a cord that attaches to your vehicle’s ignition system.
You are required to blow into the mouthpiece to test your Breath Alcohol
Concentration (BrAC) before starting your car.
If your BrAC is below the limit set by your state, your
vehicle will start. If your BrAC is above your state’s limit, your vehicle
will not start until you submit a breath sample that no longer detects
alcohol.
All activity is stored in the device and sent to your monitoring
department (court, DMV, probation officer, etc.). With real-time reporting
capabilities, Intoxalock is able to upload data immediately to our Log
Reporter website. Some states require the information to be made available
immediately, while others require the data to be sent monthly.
How to use an ignition interlock device video






Step by step instructions
To use your ignition interlock device, press the button on the handheld
unit and wait until the LED displays “Blow.” Most states require you to
submit a blow, inhale, blow breath pattern into the mouthpiece. Some states
require you to just blow into the device. Check your User’s
Manual for detailed instructions.
All states require mandated retests to be submitted while the vehicle is
running. The interlock device will ask for a retest at randomly spaced time
intervals with a loud beep and a message displayed on the LED screen of the
handheld. The user must submit another breath sample each time a retest is
requested. If alcohol is detected during a retest, your ignition interlock
will not turn off your vehicle while it is in motion but it will give a
signal for you to stop.
Intoxalock device accuracy
Intoxalock uses fuel cell technology in all devices to ensure the
highest levels of accuracy and reliability. Check your state’s
requirements to see which products are approved in your state.

Blow & Drive Interlock, based in Los Angeles, California, is a publicly traded company that manufactures, distributes, and leases its Ignition Interlock Device Model# BDI-747 across 11 States in the United States of America.[4][5][6][7]

The BDI-747[edit]
The BDI-747 is a state of the art ignition interlock device, breath-alcohol testing device approximately the size of a smartphone. The ignition interlock device requires the driver to exhale into the device prior to starting the vehicle. The device will prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver's blood-alcohol content exceeds a predetermined set level. It is the only wireless, digital, touchscreen, GPS-enabled, ignition interlock device to comply with the 2013 NHTSA guidelines.
Interlocks may be required for use by DUI or DWI ("driving under the influence" or "driving while intoxicated") offenders as part of their mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. The individual subject to the court or motor vehicle order pays for the installation/removal and monthly lease of the ignition interlock device. Blow & Drive Interlock provides services relating to monitoring of the device at predetermined intervals according to state guidelines. Data is then collected and made available to the appropriate authorities for review.
The Company's principal location is in Los Angeles County, California and has over 100 qualified personnel to install, calibrate, remove and monitor the devices across the eleven U.S. states where it has received approvals to operate. The Company's business plan includes growth of the Company by continuing to complete and submit state applications and to build up its service infrastructure by utilizing its own retail infrastructure, independent installers, distributors and franchisees.[3][8][9][10][11][12][4]
Regulatory Approvals[edit]
Blow & Drive Interlock received U.S. Federal certification from the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration to provide criminal monitoring services by means of its BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device in 2014. It has since received U.S. State approvals to provide services in conjunction with the judiciary or administrative arms in eleven states since it began formally leasing devices in 2015:[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

Recent Developments[edit]
In September 2016 Blow & Drive Interlock entered into a letter of intent with The Doheny Group to finance an expansion to quadruple the company's market share from its supply of 500 machines to 2,100 machines but then in November announced it was in fact increasing funding to expand the company’s marketshare to 2,700 machines to meet high demand. In a January 2017 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company reported that it had scaled up production and increased its inventory by approximately 75% to over 2,000 machines and was still on track to meet the 2,700 goal by the end of that fiscal quarter. The company announced it had completed production and deployment reaching this 2,700-machine goal in March 2017 as well as beginning the production process of a further additional 1,000 units, which would bring its total machine-count to 3,700.[20][21][22][23][24]
The company participated with Mothers Against Drunk Driving as a data provider in their MADD 2017 Ignition Interlock Report. The report estimated that 2.3 million attempts to drive drunk had been prevented by ignition interlock legislation since 2006. Over 350,000 driving attempts were stopped in 2016 alone. According to the National Transportation Administration's Department's Office of Behavioral Research, each of these drivers would have had an estimated 6.75x greater chance of crash risk.[25] According to MADD's report, "Every state in the nation has an ignition interlock law of some kind. MADD's goal is for every state to have the most effective ignition interlock law, which is one that applies to every drunk driver after the first offense. When MADD's Campaign started, only New Mexico had an all-offender ignition interlock law. Today, 28 states and the District of Columbia require ignition interlocks for offenders with a .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and above after the first offense. MADD is committed to working with the other 22 states to pass similar laws, and to help every state optimize its laws and expand the use of technology to stop the tragedies caused by drunk driving." [26]
In April 2017, Equities.com did a feature on Blow and Drive's expansion into the state of Texas and how the state is a key for the company as there is a huge market with high demand for its product. The article also highlighted research from Bloomberg and Forbes stating that the potential implications of MADD's proposed legislation will result in the ignition interlock industry exponentially expanding and reaching $1.1 billion to $3.2 billion as early as years 2018-2020.[27][28] The article states that Blow and Drive intends to have over 10,000 ignition interlock devices leased and generating revenue by year-end 2017. The company has increased leased units from December 2016 to March of this year by 145%.[29]

The BDI-747[edit]
The BDI-747 is a state of the art ignition interlock device, breath-alcohol testing device approximately the size of a smartphone. The ignition interlock device requires the driver to exhale into the device prior to starting the vehicle. The device will prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver's blood-alcohol content exceeds a predetermined set level. It is the only wireless, digital, touchscreen, GPS-enabled, ignition interlock device to comply with the 2013 NHTSA guidelines.
Interlocks may be required for use by DUI or DWI ("driving under the influence" or "driving while intoxicated") offenders as part of their mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. The individual subject to the court or motor vehicle order pays for the installation/removal and monthly lease of the ignition interlock device. Blow & Drive Interlock provides services relating to monitoring of the device at predetermined intervals according to state guidelines. Data is then collected and made available to the appropriate authorities for review.
The Company's principal location is in Los Angeles County, California and has over 100 qualified personnel to install, calibrate, remove and monitor the devices across the eleven U.S. states where it has received approvals to operate. The Company's business plan includes growth of the Company by continuing to complete and submit state applications and to build up its service infrastructure by utilizing its own retail infrastructure, independent installers, distributors and franchisees.[3][8][9][10][11][12][4]
Regulatory Approvals[edit]
Blow & Drive Interlock received U.S. Federal certification from the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration to provide criminal monitoring services by means of its BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device in 2014. It has since received U.S. State approvals to provide services in conjunction with the judiciary or administrative arms in eleven states since it began formally leasing devices in 2015:[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

Recent Developments[edit]
In September 2016 Blow & Drive Interlock entered into a letter of intent with The Doheny Group to finance an expansion to quadruple the company's market share from its supply of 500 machines to 2,100 machines but then in November announced it was in fact increasing funding to expand the company’s marketshare to 2,700 machines to meet high demand. In a January 2017 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company reported that it had scaled up production and increased its inventory by approximately 75% to over 2,000 machines and was still on track to meet the 2,700 goal by the end of that fiscal quarter. The company announced it had completed production and deployment reaching this 2,700-machine goal in March 2017 as well as beginning the production process of a further additional 1,000 units, which would bring its total machine-count to 3,700.[20][21][22][23][24]
The company participated with Mothers Against Drunk Driving as a data provider in their MADD 2017 Ignition Interlock Report. The report estimated that 2.3 million attempts to drive drunk had been prevented by ignition interlock legislation since 2006. Over 350,000 driving attempts were stopped in 2016 alone. According to the National Transportation Administration's Department's Office of Behavioral Research, each of these drivers would have had an estimated 6.75x greater chance of crash risk.[25] According to MADD's report, "Every state in the nation has an ignition interlock law of some kind. MADD's goal is for every state to have the most effective ignition interlock law, which is one that applies to every drunk driver after the first offense. When MADD's Campaign started, only New Mexico had an all-offender ignition interlock law. Today, 28 states and the District of Columbia require ignition interlocks for offenders with a .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and above after the first offense. MADD is committed to working with the other 22 states to pass similar laws, and to help every state optimize its laws and expand the use of technology to stop the tragedies caused by drunk driving." [26]
In April 2017, Equities.com did a feature on Blow and Drive's expansion into the state of Texas and how the state is a key for the company as there is a huge market with high demand for its product. The article also highlighted research from Bloomberg and Forbes stating that the potential implications of MADD's proposed legislation will result in the ignition interlock industry exponentially expanding and reaching $1.1 billion to $3.2 billion as early as years 2018-2020.[27][28] The article states that Blow and Drive intends to have over 10,000 ignition interlock devices leased and generating revenue by year-end 2017. The company has increased leased units from December 2016 to March of this year by 145%.[29]
