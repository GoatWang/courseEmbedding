Laura Kendall


 Laura C. Kendall, B.B.A.'73Outstanding Alumni Achievement Award, 2013After earning her bachelor’s in business administration from WMU, Laura Kendall embarked on a path of developing a strong financial background as a platform for executive growth primarily in the retail industry.
After spending the first 11 years of her career in the Grand Rapids office of Arthur Anderson as a certified public accountant, Kendall took the opportunity to return home to the Detroit area, working as vice president of finance for Perry Drug Stores. Developing skills in the area of acquisitions, financing, technology and integration of new operating platforms, she moved to the role of chief financial officer of F & M Distributors.
In 1997, Kendall moved to North Carolina and joined Food Lion as executive vice president and chief financial officer. During her tenure, she was instrumental in developing and financing the NYSE company, Delhaize America, while directing the finance, treasury, operational planning, information technology and internal audit functions.
In 2003, after developing a consulting practice under the corporate banner CFOdynamics, she joined one of her clients, Tanner Companies, as chief financial officer. During the next 10 years, Kendall’s responsibilities at this vertically integrated manufacturer and direct seller of women’s apparel grew, and she assumed the role of president.
Kendall recently stepped down from her role as president to be part of the company’s board of directors. In addition, she serves on the boards of the Bank of Commerce and Tanner Companies. Currently, Kendall is advising the North Carolina Secretary of Commerce in the transition of the Rural Economic Development Center into the North Carolina Department of Commerce.
