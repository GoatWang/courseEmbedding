Citrix Appoints Board Member Robert Calderoni as Interim President and CEO



Board Continues Search for Permanent CEO

 SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) today announced that Robert Calderoni, Citrix's

      Executive Chairman, has been unanimously appointed interim president and

      CEO, effective immediately. Mr. Calderoni will continue serving as

      Executive Chairman on the Citrix Board of Directors. Mark Templeton,

      current president and CEO, will serve in an advisory role through the

      end of the year.

    


      The Board's previously announced CEO search process remains underway,

      led by a search committee consisting of Mr. Calderoni (committee chair),

      Godfrey R. Sullivan and Jesse A. Cohn, with the assistance of executive

      search firm, Heidrick & Struggles.

    


      "On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mark for his vision,

      talent and leadership over the last two decades," said Thomas Bogan,

      lead independent director for Citrix. "Mark's contributions in

      transforming our company into a $3 billion global technology leader, to

      our customers, and to our industry have been remarkable, and the entire

      Citrix team wishes him the very best."

    

Mr. Bogan continued, "We are fortunate that Bob has agreed to step into

      the role of interim CEO during this important time for Citrix. With more

      than 30 years of executive experience in the technology sector, and as a

      director of Citrix, Bob has a deep understanding not only of the

      marketplace, but of our business as well. We thank Bob for assuming

      these additional responsibilities while the committee continues to

      conduct its CEO search process, and believe that he is the right choice

      to lead Citrix as we continue to focus on the transformative initiatives

      announced in July."

    

Mr. Calderoni said, "The Citrix team has a deep bench of talented

      employees, and I look forward to working together, alongside the Board

      and leadership team, as we execute on our strategy to securely deliver

      the world's most important apps. In addition to our CEO search, I will

      be focused on continuing the momentum we have in our operational and

      strategic review of the business. Citrix remains well positioned to

      build on its positive momentum, as evidenced by the strong financial

      results announced today."

    

Mr. Templeton said, "It has been an honor and a truly rewarding

      experience to lead this company and to work with the finest team in the

      industry, as well as the best customers and partners in the world.

      Citrix will continue to excel under Bob's leadership, and the Board will

      continue its thoughtful and deliberate process of selecting a permanent

      CEO. Every day that I have spent at Citrix has been a privilege, and I

      look forward to staying on in an advisory role to ensure a smooth

      transition."

Citrix Appoints Board Member Robert Calderoni as Interim President and CEO | Business Wire


























































Citrix Appoints Board Member Robert Calderoni as Interim President 
      and CEO




Board Continues Search for Permanent CEO






October 21, 2015 04:06 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) today announced that Robert Calderoni, Citrix’s 
      Executive Chairman, has been unanimously appointed interim president and 
      CEO, effective immediately. Mr. Calderoni will continue serving as 
      Executive Chairman on the Citrix Board of Directors. Mark Templeton, 
      current president and CEO, will serve in an advisory role through the 
      end of the year.
    


      The Board’s previously announced CEO search process remains underway, 
      led by a search committee consisting of Mr. Calderoni (committee chair), 
      Godfrey R. Sullivan and Jesse A. Cohn, with the assistance of executive 
      search firm, Heidrick & Struggles.
    

      “On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mark for his vision, 
      talent and leadership over the last two decades,” said Thomas Bogan, 
      lead independent director for Citrix. “Mark’s contributions in 
      transforming our company into a $3 billion global technology leader, to 
      our customers, and to our industry have been remarkable, and the entire 
      Citrix team wishes him the very best.”
    

      Mr. Bogan continued, “We are fortunate that Bob has agreed to step into 
      the role of interim CEO during this important time for Citrix. With more 
      than 30 years of executive experience in the technology sector, and as a 
      director of Citrix, Bob has a deep understanding not only of the 
      marketplace, but of our business as well. We thank Bob for assuming 
      these additional responsibilities while the committee continues to 
      conduct its CEO search process, and believe that he is the right choice 
      to lead Citrix as we continue to focus on the transformative initiatives 
      announced in July.”
    

      Mr. Calderoni said, “The Citrix team has a deep bench of talented 
      employees, and I look forward to working together, alongside the Board 
      and leadership team, as we execute on our strategy to securely deliver 
      the world’s most important apps. In addition to our CEO search, I will 
      be focused on continuing the momentum we have in our operational and 
      strategic review of the business. Citrix remains well positioned to 
      build on its positive momentum, as evidenced by the strong financial 
      results announced today.”
    

      Mr. Templeton said, “It has been an honor and a truly rewarding 
      experience to lead this company and to work with the finest team in the 
      industry, as well as the best customers and partners in the world. 
      Citrix will continue to excel under Bob’s leadership, and the Board will 
      continue its thoughtful and deliberate process of selecting a permanent 
      CEO. Every day that I have spent at Citrix has been a privilege, and I 
      look forward to staying on in an advisory role to ensure a smooth 
      transition.”
