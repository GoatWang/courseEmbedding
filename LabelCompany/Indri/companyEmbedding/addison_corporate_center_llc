Windsor property caught  in legal tangle

The Addison Corporate Center in Windsor, pictured above, is ensnarled in a messy lawsuit brought by nearly three dozen investors who are accusing New York-based Cabot Investment Properties, its managers and subsidiary units, of misappropriating funds and not paying utility bills or debt service.

The Addison Corporate Center in Windsor has been an attractive property over the years, playing home to major corporate tenants like Alstom Power and Ace Insurance and luring tens of millions of dollars from banks and wide-eyed investors from across the country.But behind the scenes recently things haven't been so pretty for the 585,222-square-foot office and industrial complex located at 175 Addison Rd.Unpaid bills and fraud allegations against an investment company involved in the purchase of the property in 2006 have put the complex on an uneven financial footing. It has also led to a flurry of lawsuits from investors and major brokerage firms, who allege that millions of dollars in property rental income have gone missing and that hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees haven't been paid.Disputes over back pay allegedly owed to utility and janitorial services companies have led to threats of the building's power being shut off and clean up services discontinued, court records show.Meanwhile, a special servicer has been appointed to monitor the property's $53 million mortgage, which is several months past due, putting the property in danger of foreclosure."It's been challenging," said W. Major Chance, a California-based real estate investor, who has an ownership stake in the property. "It was supposed to be an idle investment but it turns out it's taken six hours of my day to preserve the asset."Chance, who is the CEO of a San Diego-based senior housing and health care management company, is one of 33 investors in the Addison Corporate Center who recently filed suit in Hartford Superior Court against New York-based Cabot Investment Properties, its management and subsidiary companies, alleging that they misappropriated $2.6 million in operating income from the building and broke its contractual obligations to pay the property's debt service, commissions to brokers, and utility expenses.Cabot employees named in the suit include Carlton Cabot, Timothy Kroll, and Albert Brayson.Hartford attorney John M. Wolfson, who is representing the Cabot defendants, said his clients "deny the claims made by the Plaintiffs in the recent litigation and will vigorously defend against them in the Superior Court."Cabot Investment Properties, which is facing legal troubles in California as well, led the purchase of Addison Corporate Center in 2006 for $66.4 million.The acquisition was financed with a $53 million mortgage from Wachovia Bank and $23 million raised from the 33 individual investors, who aren't identified in the suit but are located across the country, Chance said.The investors participated in a tenant-in-common deal offered by a subsidiary unit of Cabot Investment. It's a type of real estate partnership that allows investors to pool their money to purchase a building and take an undivided, fractional ownership stake in it.The 33 investors each set up limited liability companies to invest in the property and they joined the lawsuit against Cabot, court records show.Those investors, most of whom aren't real estate professionals by trade, are the landlord of Addison Corporate Center, but they signed a master lease agreement with LeaseCo, a subsidiary unit of Cabot Investment Properties, to manage the operations of the complex, court records show.Cabot and its various subsidiary units were responsible for handling the buildings finances, collecting rent from tenants, and paying expenses, court records show.Things appeared to be going well until late 2011 and 2012 when LeaseCo was hit with several different lawsuits by companies who said they were owed money. Those filing suits included Compass Group USA, a North Carolina-based food management company, Hartford brokerage firm Sentry Commercial, and realty advisory firm Grubb & Ellis, who alleged they were owed $81,828.17, $168,669.90 and $393,563.10 respectively in unpaid commissions, court records show.Realty brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield is owed an additional $417,528 in brokerage fees but hasn't filed suit against Cabot, court papers show.Other allegations in the suit against LeasCo, court records show, include:• $220,000 in unpaid utility charges, and threats from Connecticut Light & Power to shut off service to the property.• Failure to make debt service payments of about $260,000 a month.Chance said about three debt service payments have been missed, putting the property's mortgage in default and in danger of foreclosure.A foreclosure would wipe out the investments made by the 33 investors.A special servicer has been assigned to oversee the mortgage, which is past due by 90 days, according to Trepp LLC, a New York-based research firm that tracks commercial mortgage-backed securities.Chance said investors didn't become of aware of the financial problems until August, which is when they filed suit against Cabot Investment Properties and its various subsidiaries. Initially, not all 33 investors joined the suit, but Chance said the original complaint will be amended to include the rest of the investors.Besides unpaid bills, the suit also alleges that Cabot diverted about $2.6 million in rental income from the property "for personal use and/or use by other entities owned and/or controlled," by the company and its management team."It appears that these funds may have been re-directed in fraud of creditors," the suit said.About $700,000 in monthly rental income from the property was supposed to be set aside to pay debt service and other expenses, but there was only about $400,000 going into the reserve, court papers said.Since the suit was filed in August, Chance said the property has been stabilized, although investors still don't know where the alleged missing funds are. They also haven't received financial records from Cabot, which was ordered to produce documents by the judge, Chance said.James Valvano, an attorney from Gordon & Rees in New Jersey who is representing the 33 investors, said the master lease agreement with LeaseCo has been terminated and that Cabot Investment is no longer involved with the day-to-day operations of the property.Approximately $750,000 in rental income has also been set aside in an escrow account to pay off unpaid commissions, although the rights to those funds haven't been determined by the court, Valvano said.Outstanding utility expenses are now paid, Valvano said.The big issues left will be trying to figure out where the alleged $2.6 million in missing funds have gone, and keeping the property out of foreclosure. The original mortgage from Wachovia Bank was securitized, which is why a special servicer has been assigned to oversee the loan on behalf of bondholders.Valvano said they have been given no indication that a foreclosure is imminent.Meanwhile, Chance said the property is operating well and tenants continue to extend their leases and space there.Besides Alstom Power and Ace Insurance, Sun Life Financial, Belcan Engineering, and Quest Global are also tenants in the Addison Corporate Center, which has a vacancy rate of about 8 percent, Chance said.
