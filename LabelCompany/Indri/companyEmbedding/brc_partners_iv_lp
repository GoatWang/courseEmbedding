»What's LPG

 

GENERAL ASPECTS
WHAT�S LPG FUEL?
        LPG is the international acronym for Liquefied Petroleum Gas. It is a crude refining product and a Natural Gas coming from the oilfields. 
It has a complex composition but it is mainly made up by propane and butane.
WHICH ARE THE PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS OF LPG VEHICLES SUPPLY?
      Used in motor-traction, LPG gives vehicles excellent performances in terms of power, flexibility and engine good working. It prevents an early engine wear, it extends the duration of spark plugs, valves and pistons and it maintains the same engine properties for longer.
For petrol and gas oil vehicles is pervasively acknowledged that the main polluting elements are carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate dust (microscopic particles containing a chemical elements mix � just for diesel oil engine), which still are a big problem to resolve.
LPG has carbon and nitrogen oxides emissions much lower than the petrol engine ones and in case of nitrogen oxides and dust particulate pollutes roughly a 90% less than any diesel oil vehicle.

STATISTICAL ASPECTS
HOW MANY VEHICLES WITH LPG SUPPLY MOVE IN ITALY?
        Recent sector estimates indicate that LPG vehicles are roughly 1.500.000.
In 2007 have been installed in Italy, in After Market, about 160.000 LPG supply systems.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS
HOW THE LPG VEHICLE IS REFUELLED AND HOW LONG DOES REFUELLING TAKE?
        A LPG vehicle is refuelled hooking up the suitable gun to the car refuelling point (situated on the back fender or in the petrol refuelling little door), which changes according to the countries.
Before moving to a foreign country, it�s better to control if your refuelling point is the suitable one: otherwise, you have to provide yourself with the suitable refuelling point adapter.
WHAT KIND OF AUTONOMY HAS THE LPG CONVERTED VEHICLE?
        Calculation has to be made for every case, starting from tank dimension (its capacity is imprinted on it). For security reasons, norms provide for an 80% filling of tank capacity.
For instance, in a 60 litres tank you can stock 48 effective LPG litres. Assuming to drive on average 10 km with an LPG litre (roughly equal to drive 12 km/l with petrol), autonomy will be at about 480 km.
WHY THE VEHICLE AUTONOMY CAN CHANGE FROM A FILLING TO ANOTHER ONE?
        Different driving conditions and sometimes the different LPG chemical composition can influence very much the consumptions. Therefore it is important compare consumptions on equal use terms.
IS IT TRUE THAT LPG SYSTEM DAMAGES THE ENGINE?
       LPG system doesn�t damage absolutely the right engine working, rather it extends its life.
CAN I TURN INTO LPG THE VEHICLE�.. TURBO�. CATALYTIC� 3 OR 8 CYLINDERS?
       BRC Gas Equipment has LPG supply systems compatibles and ratified with most of the engine of vehicles on the market nowadays. Thereby, you can turn into LPG without technical problems almost all the vehicles with original petrol supply, both the carburettor ones, and the catalytic or not catalytic injection ones, supercharged too.
We suggest, anyway, turning to a BRC workshop that will verify the kind of engine and will give you specific information..
CAN I INSTALL AN LPG SYSTEM ON AN ESTATE CAR OR ON A MINIVAN?
       Yes, the issue n. 58 of 30 of April 1996 allows it.
WHICH IS THE POWER LOSS OF A LPG CONVERTED ENGINE?
       In case of the most advanced system (BRC SEQUENT sequential multipoint gas injection), you can�t perceive difference in performances during the practical use of the car (roughly a 2-3 % of power loss), whereas it become bigger for the less modern systems (mix traditional systems).
HOW DOES  CONSUMPTIONS CHANGE USING LPG? 
      It is in the LPG nature to have a specific energy lower than the petrol; the consumption increase is about the 20%.
DESPITE THE LPG ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGIC POSITIVE ASPECTS, THE LUGGAGE VAN SPACE BECOMES LOWER?
        We want to underline that you can install on your vehicle two kinds of LPG tank: the ring-shaped tank and the cylindrical one. In the first case, usually tank is installed in the spare wheel compartment (both inside and outside the vehicle), leaving completely free the luggage van. The cylindrical tank, whereas, is usually installed in the luggage van, so that the car load capacity will be partially limited according to the tank dimensions.
DO THE LPG SYSTEMS NEED A SPECIFIC MAINTENANCE?
        They don�t need a specific maintenance, we suggest following the ones indicated in the use and maintenance handbook of the system.

ECONOMIC ASPECTS
WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE LPG PRICE?
       LPG supplied in the refuelling stations is measured in litres.
A LPG litre (data taken in Sept. 07) costs on average 0,700 Euros.
On the other hand, an Unleaded petrol litre costs on average 1,430 Euros.
HOW MUCH IS ON AVERAGE THE CONVERSION FROM A PETROL SUPPLY INTO A PETROL-LPG SUPPLY (BI FUEL)?
       The LPG conversion cost is influenced by many factors, such as the vehicle original supply (carburettor, injection, etc�), the kind of installed equipment (traditional, timed injection, etc�), the kind of tank, etc�
However, in order to give an idea, the transformation average cost, installing a cylindrical tank, is about or:
-    � 800,00 for carburettor or EURO 0/EURO 1 injection vehicles;
-    � 1.200,00 for injection vehicle with carburetion control EURO 0/EURO 1;
-    � 1.650,00 for catalytic vehicle with gaseous injection system;
-    � 1.800,00 for catalytic vehicle with sequential injection system.
These values are purely suggestive and don�t consider extras for the ring-shaped tank (about � 100,00), for level indicator (� 50,00), for final test (� 130,00).
In order to have the right cost of the conversion, we suggest turning to a BRC installer.
CAN I BENEFIT OF ECONOMIC INCENTIVES IF I CONVERT A PETROL SUPPLY VEHICLE IN A SECOND TIME?
       In this moment economic incentives for converting vehicles are ended.
There are instead some LOCAL MEASURES and other incentives that favour users of LPG or CNG vehicles. For all the details concerning these measures, see www.ecogas.it o www.federmetano.it or turn to a BRC installer.
IS IT POSSIBLE DRIVE WITH LPG VEHICLES DURING THE TRAFFIC RESTRICTION PERIODS?
      Thanks to the very low polluting emissions, LPG vehicles can free-move inside the historical centre during the traffic restriction periods too, except for different indications.

SAFETY
CAN I PARK THE VEHICLE, WITH LPG SUPPLY TOO, INTO THE UNDERGROUND OR PUBLIC GARAGES? ARE THERE OTHER RESTRICTIONS? 
            All vehicles equipped with a LPG system after 2002 (responding therefore to the ECE/ONU 67/01 norm) can park until the first floor of underground garages, also if communicating with a lower floor. Instead, LPG vehicles not complying at R.67/01 can always park in the garages just in the outside floors not communicating with the underground floors.
For what concerning the transport by sea with ferryboats, whereas, LPG vehicles have to be declared when you book your travel. Moreover, you have to inform the naval officers so that they can board you car in the place reserved to LPG. On the contrary, for air and railway transport there are no forbiddances, as for the transit in galleries, tunnels or viaducts.
