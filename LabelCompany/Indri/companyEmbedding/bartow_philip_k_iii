Philip K. Dick: Five Novels of the 1960s & 70s
          


Martian Time-Slip | Dr. Bloodmoney | Now Wait for Last Year | Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said | A Scanner Darkly



            Edited by Jonathan  Lethem
          


“Dick was not ahead of his time. Rather, he was scarily in sync with it. Now his fiction, full of comedy, melancholy, and paranoia, matches our own peculiar circumstances at the beginning of a frightening new century.” — San Francisco Gate
