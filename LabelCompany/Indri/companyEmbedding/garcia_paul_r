												Paul Garcia, CEO. Global Payments 											




By Staff Writer,  ATLANTA TREND™

In February of this year Global Payments CEO Paul Garcia was named one of “The Best CEOs in America” for the fifth time by Institutional Investor magazine. Global Payments was also recognized for being among America's most successful companies, according to the magazine's annual "U.S. Investor Relations" rankings. Atlanta based Global Payments is a leading provider of electronic transaction processing services for merchants, Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs), financial institutions, government agencies and multi-national corporations located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. According to Institutional Investor, close to 800 portfolio managers and buy-side individuals, as well as 570 sell-side analysts, contributed their opinions to the 2010 poll. 
"The All-America Executive Team honors corporate leaders who did an outstanding job guiding their companies through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression by staying true to their long-term vision," says Institutional Investor Executive Editor Michael Peltz.
Mr. Garcia’s tenure as CEO has indeed been a successful one. When he led the company’s spin out from National Data Corporation in 2001, annual revenue was in the range of $350 million. Global Payments achieved revenues of over $1.6 billion by 2009. He credits his success to getting all employees to buy into a clear mission and vision for the company.
