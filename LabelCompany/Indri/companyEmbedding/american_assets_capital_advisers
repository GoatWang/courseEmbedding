Welcome to American Assets Capital Advisers
We are an investment manager specializing in real estate securities. Our team of investment professionals is deep in real estate with more than 80 years of experience. We manage separate accounts and mutual funds for institutions and individuals focusing on global real estate securities, which include REITs, real estate operating companies, lodging and gaming, housing, land development and real estate services, and real estate finance.
We are unabashedly focused on quality. We own securities that we believe are “A” assets in “A” markets managed by “A” companies. Our bias keeps us  from owning what we consider to be generic real estate in generic markets or generally average real estate companies just because they “screen” cheaply.




A panel of judges comprised of independent industry professionals, appointed by HFM, determined the winners based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. For additional information, visit the following link.


We are looking for a relationship between the landlord and tenant in which the tenant is denied choice.  This allows the landlord to maintain high occupancy and drive rent.

Blog

Our blog is designed to provide color and context on the thought processes that define our portfolio management.  As you probably know, the financial world is awash with information and opinions.  In our blog, we strive to separate what’s important from what’s not and ignore the latter.  We frame the issues and drivers behind them in a topical and brief piece of commentary.
We welcome questions and comments and would love to hear from you!


 REITs vs. Your Home			 August 16, 2016/in Blog /by Creede MurphyMany people don’t have an investment allocation to real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) because they believe they already have “enough” exposure to “real estate” through ownership of their home. REITs and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics. REITs invest primarily in commercial real estate, which is any non-residential property used […]

 The Wave of Private Capital Behind Public REITs			 August 5, 2016/in Blog /by Creede MurphyFlush with record levels of cash, many private capital real estate managers are buying up publicly traded real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) to take advantage of the gap between public REITs and private real estate valuations. Historically, commercial real estate in the private market has usually transacted at, or near, fair value (or else the […]

 Imperial Government			 April 13, 2016/in Blog /by Creede MurphyAs real estate securities analysts, most of the things we do have some basis in being knowable.

While none of this is completely knowable, it’s partly knowable. In the last […]

 A Tale of Two Stocks			 March 16, 2016/in Blog /by Creede MurphyA tale of two stocks and a tale of two investors that, we believe, demonstrate the sometimes illogical nature of perceptions and how those perceptions can drive valuation.

 Buy the (P/NAV) Dip			 October 16, 2015/in Blog /by Creede MurphyNet asset value (“NAV”) is one of the core valuation metrics for real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). The metric aims to determine the inherent value of a REIT by assigning approximate liquidation values to the underlying real estate. To do so, investors must derive a series of go forward expectations such as net operating income […]

American Assets Capital Advisers |   REITs vs. Your Home





















































Blog - Latest News



 REITs vs. Your Home			 August 16, 2016/in Blog /by Creede MurphyMany people don’t have an investment allocation to real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) because they believe they already have “enough” exposure to “real estate” through ownership of their home. REITs and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics. REITs invest primarily in commercial real estate, which is any non-residential property used for commercial profit-making purposes. Your home is an investment in residential real estate, which is a type of property, containing either a single-family or multifamily structure, which is available for occupation and non-business purposes.
Performance
Over the past 20 years publicly-traded REITs have returned an annualized 11.23% total return and homes have returned 3.47%, or just a little more than inflation. Over these 20 years, REITs returned more than 7x (740%) while homes didn’t quite double (98%). Publicly-traded REITs have been one of the top performing asset classes and homes have been one of the worst over the past 20 years.
There are many differences between REITs and your home that contribute to this notable difference in performance. The largest contributor is that commercial real estate can generate positive cash flows but the residential home you live in cannot. By living in your home, you are effectively consuming the market rate rent that your home might have procured. If you forgo rent, as you do by living in your home, the return profile changes to be basically little more than an inflation hedge. Performance of real estate follows the following formula: Total Return = price change + rent collected

Diversification
With your home, 100% of the asset is in one property type and in one geographic market – this is concentration in its purist form, the opposite of diversification. On the other hand, with publicly-traded REITs, investors can choose from dozens of property types (including, but not limited to, specialized real estate sectors such as data centers, cell phone towers, casinos, medical research labs, infrastructure, prisons, ski areas, etc.) across any market in the U.S. and most major markets in the world. The opportunity for diversification in publicly-traded REITs vastly exceeds that of a single home.
Liquidity
Homes are relatively illiquid compared to public REITs that can be traded every day the stock market is open and settle to cash virtually immediately. This is in stark contrast to the home market, which may be illiquid for months, seasons, or even years, and can take months to settle to cash.
Transaction Costs
Transacting a home is much more costly than transacting in publicly-traded REITs. When you sell a home, the typical transaction cost is more than 6% of the home’s sale price (for perspective, based on data from the last 20 years as shown in the Total Return chart above, this is equal to about five years’ worth of your home’s price appreciation after inflation). In contrast, it costs little more than pocket change to trade shares of a public REIT ($7.95 per trade at Fidelity[1] and $4.95 per trade at Scottrade[2]).
Flexibility
Home ownership is not flexible. The entry price for a home is typically six-figures and you can’t really buy or sell a percentage of a home – it is binary: either you are in all the way or you are completely out. With publicly-traded REITs you can buy almost any amount you wish in single share increments (typically $20-$50/share) on the stock market. With public REITs you can trim, add or change a position in almost any amount on almost any day.
Supply & Demand
Perhaps the single most impactful factor that undermines home price appreciation is the ability of developers to add new product to the market. In our opinion, homes are the type of real estate most likely to be oversupplied because we believe they are the cheapest, smallest, quickest and least complicated real estate product type to build. AACA also believes that whenever the cost to build new homes is below the current market value of existing homes, builders will build new homes, which could create a price ceiling on the appreciation of your home. Additionally, in recessions, construction costs (materials and labor costs) decrease, which makes building new homes less expensive and creates additional new supply. This combination of factors could dampen your home’s price rebound out of a recession relative to public REITs, as shown in the historical graph below.
Volatility
Let’s look at volatility of publicly-traded REITs and homes. Below is a graph of the past 10 years, which includes the financial crisis. Since public REITs trade on the stock market, the share price of these REITs are subject to fluctuation in the stock market and as such experience volatility. However, we would argue the underlying physical real estate owned by the REITs can’t be much different in volatility than your physical home. The difference is that your home isn’t bought and sold every day and marked to that market price. That being said, in the graph below we see that homes sold off -32.81% and public REITs sold off -58.89% in the financial crisis. However, looking at a longer period of time, homes captured 56% of the downside and 8% of the upside of public REITs over the past 10 years – homes have been asymmetrical to the downside. And public REITs have since gone on to return 105.17% over the past 10 years while homes have returned 8.56% in that same time period.

Final Thoughts
We believe you should think of your home first and foremost as the place you and your family live and second as an inflation hedge for your invested principal – nothing more than that. You should not think of your home as an investment in real estate (as history shows there has been almost no meaningful return after inflation). Publicly-traded REITs and your home are very different asset classes with very different characteristics.
But what if I rent my home out?
But what if I buy a home and rent it out? That would be good, right? Sure, you will grab the warranted rent (assuming you can find a good renter), but you may also be the one grabbing a plunger to fix the toilet on Christmas Eve when your renter calls. Also, you still need a place to live so you will presumably either be buying or renting a home to live in. Additionally, it is probably unlikely that you can rent one house as efficiently as a public REIT that has professional leasing, revenue optimization software, economies of scale, expert experience, market knowledge and real-time industry data. Lastly, if you want to buy a home and rent it out, there are several publicly-traded REITs that do that.

Burland East, CEO of American Assets Capital Advisers and sub-adviser to the Altegris/AACA Real Estate Long Short Fund (RAAIX)
Interviewer: Hi, everyone. We're on today with Burland East, CEO of American Assets Capital Advisers and sub-adviser to the Altegris/AACA Real Estate Long Short Fund (RAAIX). I was reading through your materials. You have a very different approach to investing in rets. Can you tell us about that?
Burland East: We've been at this for about 5 years in this format. And then, prior to this, I spent close to 30 years on Wall Street. So I've been through three cycles. My observance over these cycles is that what tends to win over time in the long run is real estate that is in some way unique, and unique in a way that the tenants either can't or won't leave.  I can give you a couple of examples. Within real estate, which is a large space – well north of a trillion dollars in equity market cap, and multiple hundreds of companies, they tend to be in what I call silos. For instance, manufactured housing, which would be mobile home markets, would be a silo, and lab space would be a silo, and suburban office space would be a silo, and strip centers would be a silo, and malls, and so forth – there are about 30 of these different silos.
What we look to do is underwrite a silo of companies, looking to find a situation where the real estate is either physically unique or locationally unique, or both; which creates a situation where the tenant either can't leave or is highly reluctant to leave. And as a result of that, the landlord can maintain high occupancy and have pricing power, i.e. leverage, over the tenants, so they can raise rent at a very healthy clip over a long period of time. That's our strategy.
Interviewer: Can you give us some examples of the thing you called in your literature, you called the tenant denied a choice, whereas you said they either can't or just won't - it's just not economically advantageous to them to leave. Can you give me some examples of some of those?
BE: Yes. Let's imagine for a minute that you inhabit an apartment. You're in your late twenties and you live in the suburbs of Atlanta, and you're well employed. But in Atlanta, there are no barriers to entry: apartments are functionally the same. They provide the same functional utility to the user. Within your little ring of where I want to live relative to my job, there may be 5 or 10 apartment complexes. What you are looking to do is optimize utilization, your functional utility per unit of money. Somebody builds a new apartment across the street, and offers you 6 months' free rent and better Wi-Fi, you will move. The point is, you can move, it's easy to move, and the set is functionally the same, so we don't have any embedded interest in remaining. And as long as the place across the street is practically priced, you might move. So, that's an example where the tenant has lots of choices. But instead, let's imagine that you are a large corporation, and you occupy 300,000 feet of highly developed and highly built out wet lab space. Wet lab is what you see in the science fiction movies, the gene sequencers and fume hoods and deionized water, and all kinds of highly technical stuff. And this company has PhD's in there running around that are in year three, of a seven-year efficacy study of some drug. And you, the corporation, have invested $75 million in the space yourself to bring this heavy duty equipment in and bolted to the floor and the ceiling and calibrate it.
 So, if you are in this situation, you're the corporation, as opposed to the guy living in the apartment, it just seems to us that you're a lot less likely to move. Mechanically, the act of moving would disrupt the research and force you to disassemble all of this highly technical equipment. And some of this, by the way, you've built it in a way that you can't take it with you. So, if we look at those two situations, it tells us we would rather own lab space leased to life science companies than we would own an apartment leased to some yuppie living in Atlanta. So, that's the very simple analysis breakdown. And we take this concept and apply it across this broad spectrum of real estate companies looking for this relationship with the tenant is denied choice.
Interviewer: That actually makes a lot of sense to me. I don't think I've ever heard anyone else talk about using this approach.
BE: Most people don't do this. I just used lab space and multifamily as an example, but there are other silos like manufactured housing which we like, or student housing, or cell phone towers, or data centers, or super regional malls, whatever it is. So, we're looking across all these different platforms, these silos, and then we're looking at it regionally. We want to be in markets that have a couple of characteristics, physical markets. The markets we want to be in have what I would describe as net domestic in migration. What that means is people are moving there. For instance, people are moving to Dallas. People aren't moving to Chicago. Simple analysis. You go back to the days of Kennedy, and Chicago had about six million people in it and Dallas had about a million. Flash forward to today - Chicago still has six million people, but Dallas has six million people.
 So where would you rather invest? You'd rather invest in a market where people are naturally moving in. That tends to be the Sun Belt. It tends to be coastal. It tends to be communities that have a lot of amenities, particularly recreational amenities and educational amenities. So, those are first cut. And the second cut were looking for is we want those markets to also have high barriers to entry. So, whereas I just used that as an example, Dallas has no barriers to entry. It's easy for a developer to build new products. So, if I'm trying to deny the tenant choice, the ability for an additional developer or real estate owner to come into that market and give my tenant choice is what I don't want. I want the tenant to be denied choice.
So, I would rather own, for instance, in Boston or New York or Miami or Seattle, where there is extensive, complex, regulatory, environmental and zoning structure in place. So, it's very very hard - or certainly harder, and more expensive - to add a product. So, let's say we were going to buy apartments. We would prefer not to buy them in Dallas, because they're easy to replicate in Dallas. We'd rather buy them in Seattle. It's just harder to replicate. It's harder to provide that tenants with that choice of opportunities. What most investors in real estate do is they come to the decision matrix, bringing with them baggage.
The baggage comes in two forms: First, where they live. Second, what they do. For Instance, if you happen to be in a conference, you'll eventually run into someone from Cleveland that owns suburban office space in Cleveland. But what do you have to realize is, he comes from that experience. He doesn't know anything about lab buildings or data centers or cell phone towers or super regional malls.  There's no domestic in-migration in Cleveland, people are leaving. And suburban offices are a very generic product, and the user considers it just to be functional. They are not married to the space in any way, shape, or form. So, for him, what he's looking at is, this is all he knows. The other false decision matrix is what I would describe as chasing cheap. There is an inherently attractive story in the idea that a thing, some asset, is cheaper other than other assets at the time in the same market, or cheaper than it was. The idea that I'm going to buy a dollar's worth of something for $0.50 is very appealing. So, what many real estate deals, are built around this fundamental investment concept. We don't typically pursue cheap for the sake of cheap alone. Once we decide what we like, I'll try to buy those stocks inexpensively.
 But what I won't to do is go to Cleveland and buy suburban office space just because it's cheap. But many investors will. Investors are driven by the pursuit of cheapness. We find, historically, and again, we've been doing this for a long time, starting in the mid-eighties, that things are usually cheap for a reason. The market is more efficient than you think. And the other thing about real estate is, real estate doesn't know who owns it. But it knows where it lives.  Unless you can move a suburban office from Cleveland to say San Francisco, one can't fundamentally change its value. It's captive to location. 
Interviewer: That brings me to an interesting question, because I talk to a lot of people, real estate is one of my two or three major focus areas both in writing and investing. So, when you talk to a guy in suburban Cleveland, he thinks that commercial real estate today is probably about not much going on. But if I talk to developers down here in Orlando, they can't build or buy the stuff fast enough, and they think we are in the early stages of another long bull market. Coming back up to 30,000 feet, where are we today in the real estate markets?
BE: You've highlighted a really interesting point just right there in your commentary, because you're absolutely correct. If you took the country and laid it out on a map, and you looked at - let's call it the smile states. You start at let's say Charlotte, and you run a big smile that extends up all the way to the other side all the way to Seattle. Most of those markets are growing jobs and gaining population. So, Orlando, where you live, Orlando has terrific job growth. I think Orlando's job growth - in fact, I have it right in front of me - is probably 3.5%. The country as a whole is 2.5%. So, Orlando's growing roughly 1/3 faster than the rest of the country. So, the question is, why is that? And the answer is, because you have a Republican government, no taxes, and you have available land to build. 
Interviewer: I call it the sunshine tax factor.
BE: And also it's warm. Orlando's a nice place to live, it's a beautiful city. So, you've got 3.7% job growth. The rest of the country is 2 and change. Cleveland is probably close to zero, or one or two. So, that's the first thing. So, you have net domestic in migration. So a developer can convince the bank to give them a loan, because the banker gets the same economic reports as the developer and says, "You know what, in the next 5 to 10 years, 250,000 people are moving into Orlando," for example. I think the answer is, we're halfway through the cycle. The cycle started in 2011-ish, as the great recession faded, and the normal liquidity mechanisms returned to the market. So, 11, 12, 13 accelerated. We're now in 15, so we're in, call it halfway through.
 Real estate development is exactly like the prisoners dilemma. You have a dozen or two dozen developers in a place like Orlando and all of them have the same imperfect information: they know the market is growing, but they don't know exactly how much, they don't know exactly how tenants are going to expand and they can't predict the actions of their competitors. They have imperfect information. They have guesses and estimates. And most importantly, they feel like if they don't develop, someone else will.  So they all read the same report that 1M new feet of office is needed and they all rush to build it – and 3M feet gets built.  This is how markets get overbuilt.
Interviewer: That makes sense. So, we are about midway through. We like the smile region of the country pretty much. Now, what factors are going to give us that bulletproof tenants have no real choices markets?
BE: That's probably the single most important question. We've described real estate the way you would describe it to a general investor who might not be familiar with any of these interesting or more niche property types, but works in an office building and lives in an apartment and is familiar with those kind of concepts. So, for the most part, if it's generic, we don't want to own it. What we want to own is where the industry substructure - the silo - is either a monopoly, an oligopoly, or a duopoly, with a couple to a handful of competitors. We don't want hundreds of providers of the type of property. Let's say we're in apartments. There are probably thousands of owners, developers, managers of apartments. It is a widely supplied business.
 Instead, if you look at lab space, most of the lab space in the US is owned by three companies. So, we have a loose oligopoly.  If you start out with an oligopoly, the oligopolistic competitors are less likely to compete on price. That's just the way things are - behavioral economics. The corollary to that is an oligopoly is an oligopoly because the business itself, the silo, has barriers to entry. It's hard to get into the lab space business. Now, you and I could go into the apartment business, though, it's a lot easier. So, we first search for this structure, where there is a limited number of competitors. The second thing we do is, we say, okay, we want a business in which there are enormously high barriers to entry. So, we want businesses where it's very difficult to add products, in a physical sense. And that can be entitlement, zoning, land use issues, a bunch of other stuff. So, apartments wouldn't fit, because they're easy to build. Lab space would because it's hard to build. Next thing we're looking for is this thing we call barrier to exit. What we mean by that is, could the tenant leave even if you gave them a choice? The example we usually use, we've already used one with the apartments, it's easy to leave an apartment and hard to leave a lab space.
 Then the last thing we're looking for is, is the tenants business healthy and growing? We want our tenants to be coming to us most of the time saying, "I'm growing and I need more space," not, "I'm thinking of reducing my footprint." So, when we sift through all of this, we end up with things like data centers and a cell phone towers and manufactured housing and student housing and self-storage, these silos that are niches, i.e. there are two or three players. 
Interviewer: That's a totally different way of looking at real estate markets than, I'd say, 90% of the people I've talked to over the years. Now, on your website - you've been very generous with your time, & I want to sneak one more question in here - on your website, there was an article with you talking about what's going on with California and the drought situation, and some interesting ideas of real estate companies involved in that situation. 
BE: The drought down here has been ongoing for years and years. We are now at the point where over 80% of the state is categorized as being in either extreme drought or exceptional drought. Additionally, the region is a desert. There is a relatively modest amount of natural rainfall in Southern California, San Diego, for instance, gets about 7 inches of rain a year, which isn't very much. And the way the place is paved and with the basic terrain, much of that simply flows into the ocean.
 So, we don't have much in the way of ground water retention the way you'd have in maybe New York or Illinois, where you'd go and sink a well. Our water is mostly stored in the form of snow pack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It snows over the winter, it's frozen, and in the spring it runs off. And when it runs off, it runs down rivers, and we've dammed a lot of those rivers and creates reservoirs, and that's where the water lives. The system reservoir capacity is currently 42% full. The population of southern California has increased tremendously in the last 25 years. Meanwhile, water conveyance, water storage, water purification, all of the systems put in place to provide a safe and reliable water system for the SoCal region has not kept up with that. So, we find ourselves now with 25% mandatory water reduction in Southern California. 
Interviewer: Do you have any final thoughts for us?
BE: Real estate has been a leading asset class now for 30 or 40 years. We think most investors should allocate 10 to 15% of their diversified portfolio income to commercial real estate.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
