Business Continuity Plan: Summary 

	Calamos Advisors and its affiliate Calamos Financial Services 
    (operating as Calamos Investments) have developed a Business 
    Continuity Plan to address a possible business disruption, 
    emergency or catastrophic event. While it is impossible to 
    forecast every potential problem that could occur, Calamos 
    Investments believes it has taken reasonable precautions to 
    enable it to resume business operations under a wide variety 
    of scenarios. If Calamos Investments' offices or immediate 
    surroundings were to become unsuitable for operations, Calamos 
    Investments intends to continue business under the provisions of the plans.


	So that we can respond to events as they occur, we have identified 
    functions critical to daily operations. Among other things, these 
    functions include: data back up and recovery; maintenance of all 
    mission critical systems; financial and operational processing; 
    alternative communications plans for employees and regulators; 
    alternate physical location of employees; measurement of potential 
    effects on critical suppliers, contractors, banks and counter-parties 
    and regulatory reporting. In the event of a disruption, we intend to 
    deliver these critical functions from an alternate facility or a third-party 
    service provider will deliver them to you. We require service providers 
    who provide these essential services to meet our business continuity requirements.


	Our telephone system is designed to automatically forward calls to emergency 
    backup numbers. If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact 
    us as you usually do at 630-245-7200, you should 
    contact us through our website.

21-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year and since inception returns are as of 3/31/17. Average annual total return measures net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments as an annualized average. All performance shown assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. Performance shown reflects an expense reimbursement that improved results. Load-adjusted returns are adjusted for the maximum front-end sales load of 4.75% for Class A shares (3.75% for Total Return Bond Fund). Class B shares have a declining contingent deferred sales charge over six years, with a maximum of 5% in year one (3.50% for Total Return Bond Fund Class B shares). Class B shares automatically convert to A shares after eight years. There is a 1% contingent deferred sales charge for C shares on certain redemptions within the first year of purchase. Class B and C shares have been adjusted for the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). There are no contingent deferred sales charges or distribution or service fees with respect to Class I shares. The minimum initial investment required to purchase each Fund's Class I shares is $1 million. Class I shares are offered primarily for direct investment by investors through certain tax-exempt retirement plans (including 401(k) plans, 457 plans, employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, profit sharing and money purchase pension plans, defined benefit plans and non qualified deferred compensation plans) and by institutional clients, provided such plans or clients have assets of at least $1 million.

Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to  re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.

Market Price is the price that the fund closed at on the primary listing exchange on the as of date referenced above.

NAV is the net asset value of the fund on the as of date referenced above and equals the value of all the fund's assets (less liabilities) divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Premium/Discount is the percentage difference between the net asset value of a fund and the market price.


Past Performance

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
Important Fund Information

The Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest up to 100% of their assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.

Investments by the Funds in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk--that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest--and interest rate risk--that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of the debt securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will decline.

Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest in derivative securities. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Funds will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Funds pay a premium whether or not an option is exercised.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

Market Perspectives




Economic Outlook, July 2017
July 24, 2017 We see a favorable backdrop for equities and convertible securities through the remainder of the year, although late-cycle pressures may increase going into 2018. 












Economic Outlook, April 2017
April 17, 2017 Our Investment Committee discusses the health of the U.S. and global economies, the impact of politics on the markets, and why they believe the markets can move higher from here. 












Economic Review and Outlook, January 2017 
January 19, 2017 Our Investment Committee considers the potential impact of a new presidential administration on the economy, and shares their views on interest rates, market volatility and opportunities across asset classes. 












Economic Outlook, October 2016
October 13, 2016 In “Politics, Populism and Policy: Confronting Another ‘Wall of Worry,’” the Calamos Investment Committee discusses positioning in an environment of uncertainty. 












Economic Outlook, July 2016
July 14, 2016 As U.S. equity markets soar, the Calamos Investment Committee considers the risks and opportunities in the global financial markets. 












Calamos Economic Outlook, April 2016
April 15, 2016 Our positioning remains cautious but not defensive. In a slow growth environment, growth stocks remain attractive, but a weakening dollar and stimulative central bank policies have created select opportunities among cyclicals. 












Calamos Economic Outlook, January 2016
January 13, 2016 The markets have gotten off to a rocky start in 2016. While we expect volatility to remain elevated, we see a range of opportunities across asset classes.  












Calamos Economic Outlook, October 2015
October 19, 2015 We remain positive about opportunities in growth equities and convertibles but expect volatility to remain elevated amid fiscal and monetary policy uncertainties.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
