Investors wait to see if hospitals held admission volumes in Q2

Investors will be watching beginning this week to see if hospitals maintained admission and outpatient volumes during the second quarter.The start of second-quarter earnings releases will see publicly traded hospitals trying to match fairly tough comparable numbers from last year. There was also one less weekday in this year's second quarter to provide services."We'll be looking for them to reiterate (earnings) guidance for the year," said Brian Tanquilut, senior vice president of healthcare equity research at investment firm Jefferies & Co.Giant HCA kicks off the hospital earnings season on July 25 followed over the next several days by Tenet Healthcare Corp., Community Health Systems, LifePoint Health and Universal Health Services.Tanquilut said hospitals and their physician service vendors such as Envision Healthcare are coming to grips with "a new normal" of slowing admissions growth.Hospitalizations are rising at 1% to 2% annually today vs. 3% to 4% in the years following the Affordable Care Act and related state Medicaid expansions.Growth in the ranks of the newly insured from the ACA have flattened and nearly full national employment means few new people are getting employer-sponsored insurance to juice volumes, Tanquilut said, adding that dynamic also could begin to affect outpatient volumes. ​ Envision recently throttled back guidance for growth in same-store ambulatory surgery volumes from the mid-to-high single digits to the low-to-mid single digits, Tanquilut said.Despite concerns about a repeal of the ACA, investors in hospital stocks have stuck with them given the ability of management to navigate the choppy waters.The Modern Healthcare Hospital Stock Index, encompassing nine major hospital companies, is essentially flat since the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of ACA replacement on May 4.

LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) vs.  Dorman Products, Inc. (NasdaqGS:DORM): A look inside the numbers










LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) currently has a Value Composite score of 9.  Similarly, the Value Composite Two (VC2) is calculated with the same ratios, but adds the Shareholder Yield.  The Value Composite Two of LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) is 5.
TechnicalsInvestors may be trying to figure out how much risk they are able to handle with their current stock holdings. Taking on too much risk can put unnecessary weight on the shoulders of even the sturdiest investors. On the flip side, investors who play it too safe may be shaking their heads and wondering what might have been. Finding that delicate risk balance can turn out to be the difference between sinking and swimming in the equity markets. It is highly important for investors to understand exactly what risks they are taking when buying and selling stocks. Knowing these risks may help avoid disaster down the line. Once the risk is calculated, investors should have an easier go at narrowing in on finding the right stocks to add to the portfolio. In taking a look at some other notable technicals, LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT)’s ROIC is 0.104365. The ROIC 5 year average is 0.111102 and the ROIC Quality ratio is 9.761748. ROIC is a profitability ratio that measures the return that an investment generates for those providing capital. ROIC helps show how efficient a firm is at turning capital into profits. 
We also note that LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.073934 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00644. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return.
LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) has a current MF Rank of 5249. Developed by hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt, the intention of the formula is to spot high quality companies that are trading at an attractive price. The formula uses ROIC and earnings yield ratios to find quality, undervalued stocks. In general, companies with the lowest combined rank may be the higher quality picks.
We can now take a quick look at some historical stock price index data. LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) presently has a 10 month price index of 1.10221. The price index is calculated by dividing the current share price by the share price ten months ago. A ratio over one indicates an increase in share price over the period. A ratio lower than one shows that the price has decreased over that time period. Looking at some alternate time periods, the 12 month price index is 0.98508, the 24 month is 0.77109, and the 36 month is 1.01823. Narrowing in a bit closer, the 5 month price index is 1.00771, the 3 month is 1.07219, and the 1 month is currently 0.97392.
The C-Score is a system developed by James Montier that helps determine whether a company is involved in falsifying their financial statements.  The C-Score is calculated by a variety of items, including a growing difference in net income verse cash flow, increasing days outstanding, growing days sales of inventory, increasing assets to sales, declines in depreciation, and high total asset growth.  The C-Score of LifePoint Health, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LPNT) is 0.00000.  The score ranges on a scale of -1 to 6.  If the score is -1, then there is not enough information to determine the C-Score.  If the number is at zero (0) then there is no evidence of fraudulent book cooking, whereas a number of 6 indicates a high likelihood of fraudulent activity. The C-Score assists investors in assessing the likelihood of a company cheating in the books.
Taking a look at valuation rankings for Dorman Products, Inc. (NasdaqGS:DORM), we see that the stock has a Value Composite score of 51. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 47.
Individual investors might be digging a little deeper into the playbook in order to create a winning plan for the remainder of the calendar year. The diligent investor typically has a portfolio that is diversified and ready to encounter any unforeseen market action. Even after creating the well-planned portfolio with expected returns, nobody can be absolutely sure that those returns will be seen. Setting realistic expectations can help the investor from becoming discouraged if the original plan runs into a bit of a snag. Of course every investor would like to enter the stock market and see sizeable profits right off the bat. This may only be wishful thinking for investors who aren’t ready to put in the time and energy to make sure the overall strategy stays on track and the portfolio stays properly managed.
Technicals at a GlanceIn taking a look at some other notable technicals, Dorman Products, Inc. (NasdaqGS:DORM)’s ROIC is 0.397637. The ROIC 5 year average is 0.356112 and the ROIC Quality ratio is 18.746239. ROIC is a profitability ratio that measures the return that an investment generates for those providing capital. ROIC helps show how efficient a firm is at turning capital into profits. 
There are many different tools to determine whether a company is profitable or not.  One of the most popular ratios is the “Return on Assets” (aka ROA).  This score indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets.  The Return on Assets for Dorman Products, Inc. (NasdaqGS:DORM) is 0.175164.  This number is calculated by dividing net income after tax by the company’s total assets.  A company that manages their assets well will have a higher return, while a company that manages their assets poorly will have a lower return.
Shareholder YieldWe also note that Dorman Products, Inc. (NasdaqGS:DORM) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.011775 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00941. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation.

Developed by hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt, the intention of the formula is to spot high quality companies that are trading at an attractive price.

(NasdaqGS:DORM) is 7.  A score of nine indicates a high value stock, while a score of one indicates a low value stock.  The score is calculated by the return on assets (ROA), Cash flow return on assets (CFROA), change in return of assets, and quality of earnings.  It is also calculated by a change in gearing or leverage, liquidity, and change in shares in issue.  The score is also determined by change in gross margin and change in asset turnover.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
LifePoint Health Inc's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=915.4/1630.2*91


=51.24



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, LifePoint Health Inc's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
LifePoint Health Inc's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=125.8-4103.2+0.75 * 915.4+0.5 * 155


=-3,213



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.
