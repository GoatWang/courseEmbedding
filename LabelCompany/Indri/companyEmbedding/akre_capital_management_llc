The Power of Compounding | Akre Capital Management


































































































 
 
 






The Power of Compounding by Tom Saberhagen




















What is compounding?




 




A lot has been written about the power of compounding. We’ve all heard illustrations of the extraordinary results that may be accomplished if compounding is allowed to do its work over long periods of time. But what is compounding? How does it work?
There’s an extreme example: the story of Native Americans selling the island of Manhattan. As the story goes, the selling party in the deal collected an estimated $20 worth of beads and trinkets from the transaction, which took place in the year 1626.
So how does compounding play into this? Let’s say the sellers invested their initial $20 at a rate of 9% per annum and then stuck with this investment program for the following 380 years. Today, their initial $20 would be worth more than $3,335,000,000,000,000.
I like this example of compounding because it illustrates that the rate of return on an investment doesn’t need to be extraordinary for extraordinary results to occur. What is crucial is having the ability to sustain an investment program uninterrupted over a very long period of time.
In the real world of investing, “life gets in the way”. It’s rare for an investor to enjoy a streak of decades of compounding in any investment without the interruptions of distributions and taxes. This story simply reminds us that striving for sustained, uninterrupted compounding over long periods of time is smart investing, and that’s precisely our goal.
Many people think of us as a “value investor” and others ask whether we are a value or a growth investor. We’ve started to say, we’re neither, we are a compounding investor.


 











 

 














What does it mean to be a compounding investor?




 




It means we try to invest in businesses that have the ability to compound internally over the course of many years.
To think like a compounding investor is very natural for people who buy small or private businesses. The private investor wants to concentrate carefully on a few business investments, and hopes the accountants will report back consistently at the end of each year that equity per share has grown. Private investors don’t think about trying to dart in and out of investments on a daily or monthly basis.
This approach is so basic, it’s often forgotten in the public equity markets. In public markets it’s become too easy to get distracted by hour-to-hour market gyrations and all the breathless excitement brokers and the media put on short-term news. To be a compounding investor, you need to tune out the short-term noise.
We think hard about the ingredients required for a business to compound in value over the course of many years. We believe these include: 1) an ability to generate above average returns on shareholders’ capital, 2) opportunities to deploy additional capital at above average returns, and 3) a management team with the skill and judgment to sustain the process of compounding over a long period of time in the face of competition. You’ll recognize this is just another way of describing our “three-legged stool” approach: Business, Management, Reinvestment.


 



 














How does Akre’s investment philosophy demonstrate the power of compounding?




 




We strive to invest in businesses with these three ingredients of compounding, and to buy them at reasonable prices. If we do this, there is no reason or need to trade in and out of these businesses to achieve above average returns. We don’t want to rely primarily on our contrarian instincts or our ability to play market volatility in order to generate returns. Like the private investor, we want the businesses we buy to be growing in real economic value each day.
We like to hold investments for many years to allow their internal compounding to do its work. It’s a wonderful thing not to have to realize a taxable gain. The tax deferral available by investing in businesses that compound internally is an enormous and often under-appreciated advantage.
Yet, in the real world, businesses do change. We need to be constantly vigilant about these changes. Some businesses are getting worse as years pass, while others are getting better, and so our investment portfolio gradually evolves.

Our Investment Philosophy | Akre Capital Management


































































































 
 
 






Our Investment Philosophy by Chuck Akre




















What is so important about the three-legged stool?




 




We speak a lot about “essences,” and the essence of our investment approach is perfectly captured by the visual of a “three-legged stool.” This metaphoric three legged stool describes what we look for in an investment: (1) extraordinary business, (2) talented management and (3) great reinvestment opportunities and histories. I have an old three-legged milking stool in our conference room and it is clear by looking at it that it is sturdy and durable.  We believe our stool is just as sturdy and durable based on our many years of experience!


 











 

 














What was the inspiration for your investment philosophy?




 




It is common knowledge that the average return in the U.S. equity asset category over the last century has been in the neighborhood of 9% or 10%. It just so happens that this figure correlates with the rate of return on the owner’s capital and frequently with the growth in the book value per share of the typical U.S. company. We posited from this observation that our return on an asset would therefore approximate the return on the owner’s capital, absent any distributions, and assuming a constant valuation. And since our stated goal is to compound our clients’ (partners’ and shareholders’) capital at an above average rate while incurring a below average level of risk, we needed to identify this group of superior businesses which earn above average rates of return on their owner’s capital.


 



 














How does your investment philosophy differ from other asset managers?




 




There was a time when I used to answer that question by saying, “I don’t know. You tell me.” Now, however, I believe that we are very different in at least two important ways.
First, our decision to buy or sell shares in a business is based on the same fundamental criteria. We do not set sell price targets when we buy a security – we often say we are not looking for the exit on the way in – because we are not looking to simply trade securities based on their price movement. Rather we are looking to compound the capital we manage, and have identified that investing in these “extraordinary” businesses, as we define them, is the BEST way to achieve our goal. We begin sell discussions when one or more of the legs of our stool is “broken or injured”. The outcomes over our years of experience clearly reinforce this notion.
Second, Wall Street’s obsession with what we describe as the “beat by a penny, miss by a penny” syndrome frequently gives us opportunities to make investments at attractive valuations. We keep our focus squarely on growth in the underlying economic value per share – often defined as book value per share – over the course of time. Our timetable is five and ten years ahead, and quarterly “misses” often create opportunities for the capital we manage.

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is non-diversified, meaning it may focus its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund invests in small- and medium-capitalization companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger capitalization companies. Download the prospectus.
Before you invest in the Akre Focus Fund, please refer to the Statutory Prospectus and Summary Prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 1-877-862-9556. The prospectus should be read and considered carefully before you invest or send money.
The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
The Akre Focus Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Akre Focus Fund (AKREX and AKRIX) was rated 3-Star against 1277 Large Growth funds over the last three years. The Akre Focus Fund (AKREX and AKRIX) was rated 4-Star against 1152 Large Growth funds over the last five years.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
