Erin Ventures
Unearthing Value
We are an emerging international junior mining and exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of resource properties. Erin Venture's strategy is to uncover and capitalize on unique development opportunities within Canada and various regions internationally. The Company's objective is to increase its mineral reserves by developing current properties and through the acquisition of additional mining projects.
Piskanja
Piskanja is located in a historical mining region that has good infrastructure for mining including roads, rail, electric power, experienced miners, etc., 250 km south of Belgrade, Serbia by good paved roads. Erin Ventures reported on August 31, 2010, that it had been granted a license for the Piskanja boron deposit in Serbia by the Serbian Ministry of Mining and Energy. The license includes the entire known historical mineralized area along with a substantial amount of previously unexplored ground.
On December 2nd 2013, Erin Ventures filed a National Instrument 43-101 compliant Technical Report and Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for the Piskanja boron deposit. The MRE reports an Indicated Mineral Resource totalling 5,600,000 tonnes with an average B2O3 content of 30.8 percent, and an additional Inferred Mineral Resource of 6,200,000 tonnes with an average B2O3 content of 28.8 percent. 
On September 17 2014 Erin announced a PEA which was prepared independently by SRK Consulting (UK) Limited ("SRK") in accordance with the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101. The PEA is preliminary in nature. It includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are currently considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions within the PEA will be realized.

MRE cautionary statement: ... Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to report these Mineral Resources in the Measured category and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading a part of these to this category in due course or if further technical work will enable them to reported as Mineral Reserves.
The technical information contained herein was approved by James E Wallis, M.Sc. (Eng), P. Eng., a director of the company, who is a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101.

Properties: Piskanja


Piskanja is located in a historical mining region that has good infrastructure for mining including roads, rail, electric power, experienced miners, etc., 250 km south of Belgrade, Serbia by good paved roads. Lithology at Piskanja is typical of sedimentary basins, (primarily shales, marls and limestone) with two primary gently undulating borate beds. Mineralization is primarily dense, compact colemanite with some ulexite. 

Erin Ventures was granted an exploration license with the sole right to apply for an exploitation (mining) license for the Piskanja boron deposit located in Serbia in the third quarter of 2010.
A drill program began in the third quarter of 2011, with the goal of establishing a NI43-101 compliant resource.
The initial exploration phase was completed and mine license application submitted to Serbian authorities in the summer of 2013.
Erin filed a completed National Instrument 43-101 compliant Technical Report and Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for the Piskanja boron deposit on December 2nd 2013.  The MRE reports an Indicated Mineral Resource totalling 5,600,000 tonnes with an average B2O3 content of 30.8 percent and an additional Inferred Mineral Resource of 6,200,000 tonnes with an average B2O3 content of 28.8 percent. The Mineral Resource statement has been prepared by SRK Exploration Services Ltd (SRK) in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 "Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects" ("NI"43-101").
The geological modelling was completed using 53 drill holes, totalling 19,554 metres, which contained analytical sample data with B2O3 analysis results for 1,473 samples, totalling 6,211.68 metres.
On September 17 2014 Erin announced a PEA which was prepared independently by SRK Consulting (UK) Limited ("SRK") in accordance with the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101. The PEA is preliminary in nature. It includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are currently considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the conclusions within the PEA will be realized.
Click here to view the U6467 Piskanja MRE 2016 Report
Erin Ventures Inc. [TSXV: EV] is pleased to announce an updated mineral resource estimate (MRE) for its 100% owned Piskanja boron deposit, located in Serbia. The updated mineral resource statement was authored by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd. independent of Erin, is based on 32,880 metres of drilling (a total of 98 drill-holes), and has been prepared in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” (“NI"43-101”).



MRE cautionary statement: ... Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to report these Mineral Resources in the Measured category and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading a part of these to this category in due course or if further technical work will enable them to reported as Mineral Reserves.
The technical information contained herein was approved by James E Wallis, M.Sc. (Eng), P. Eng., a director of the company, who is a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101.
Erin management is actively engaged in the due diligence process with several potential strategic partners regarding the development and exploitation of its Piskanja boron project in Serbia.





What is Boron?

Introduction
It is difficult to comprehend the variety of uses of boron in construction, manufacturing, medicine, science, microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, space travel, communication satellites, specialty metals, battery technology and more! We could not survive without the element boron. It is found all around us and we are in constant contact with this vital element – even though we are, for the most part, not aware of it.  Interestingly, economic occurrences of Boron are quite rare and large economic deposits exist in only a few places.
Some common applications of boron include glass production, insulation, fertilizer, silicon, metallurgy, LCD screens, stealth technology, sports equipment, nuclear reactors and waste storage, lithium batteries, computers, heat shields and medicines. Boron can also be found in automotive products like motor oil, brake fluid, steering fluid and antifreeze.
The number of items that contain boron in homes is surprising. Roofing materials, wallboard, paint, fiberglass insulation and cellulose insulation all contain boron. When used as a treatment for construction materials such as wood, plastic, bricks, pipes and wires, boron helps to protect from mold, fungus and insects. Boron is found in the ceramic tiles on the floors, in the porcelain enamel used on your sink, refrigerators, pots and pans. Boron is also in heat resistant cookware, crystal glass and dishwasher detergent. Boron is also found in soap, shampoo, creams, lotions, makeup, shaving cream, lens solution, hair products (dye, straighteners, perms etc.) and even tooth and denture products.  Sheets, bed coverings and clothing contain boron that improves fibre performance. Boron is also used in detergents, laundry boosters and bleaches.
All plant life requires boron to grow. Boron is key to the flowering, pollen, seed and fruit development and germination itself. It also plays a major part in the production of sugar and carbohydrates within leaves and roots. Fertilizers also contain boron. It would not be possible to grow many crops, especially in areas where the natural occurrence of boron is low, without the addition of boron. 
Boron is a critically important industrial mineral. World production of boron minerals reached an estimated 4.35 million metric tons in 2010.

Consumption of borates used in high-technical applications is expected to increase by 10% in North America and 13% in Europe by 2012. China is the largest consumer of boron, where consumption has risen by 15 percent per year from 2000 to 2010.
Borate minerals and refined borate products are used extensively worldwide in the manufacture of vitreous products such as fiberglass insulation, textile fiberglass, borosilicate glass (e.g. LCD screens), ceramic glazes and porcelain enamels.  These applications account for approximately 60 per cent of borate consumption, with detergents, fire retardants, metallurgy, agriculture, insecticides, wood preservatives and specialty products accounting for the remainder.    
Source: US Geological Survey, Report on Boron - 2010 (with 2011 update).
Market prices reflect the relative scarcity of borates with prices averaging: US$500-$700/tonne for colemanite concentrate (40% B2O3); $500-$700/tonne for ulexite (40% B2O3); $620-$900/tonne for boric acid.

What is Boron?

Introduction
It is difficult to comprehend the variety of uses of boron in construction, manufacturing, medicine, science, microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, space travel, communication satellites, specialty metals, battery technology and more! We could not survive without the element boron. It is found all around us and we are in constant contact with this vital element – even though we are, for the most part, not aware of it.  Interestingly, economic occurrences of Boron are quite rare and large economic deposits exist in only a few places.
Some common applications of boron include glass production, insulation, fertilizer, silicon, metallurgy, LCD screens, stealth technology, sports equipment, nuclear reactors and waste storage, lithium batteries, computers, heat shields and medicines. Boron can also be found in automotive products like motor oil, brake fluid, steering fluid and antifreeze.
The number of items that contain boron in homes is surprising. Roofing materials, wallboard, paint, fiberglass insulation and cellulose insulation all contain boron. When used as a treatment for construction materials such as wood, plastic, bricks, pipes and wires, boron helps to protect from mold, fungus and insects. Boron is found in the ceramic tiles on the floors, in the porcelain enamel used on your sink, refrigerators, pots and pans. Boron is also in heat resistant cookware, crystal glass and dishwasher detergent. Boron is also found in soap, shampoo, creams, lotions, makeup, shaving cream, lens solution, hair products (dye, straighteners, perms etc.) and even tooth and denture products.  Sheets, bed coverings and clothing contain boron that improves fibre performance. Boron is also used in detergents, laundry boosters and bleaches.
All plant life requires boron to grow. Boron is key to the flowering, pollen, seed and fruit development and germination itself. It also plays a major part in the production of sugar and carbohydrates within leaves and roots. Fertilizers also contain boron. It would not be possible to grow many crops, especially in areas where the natural occurrence of boron is low, without the addition of boron. 

Boron is a critically important industrial mineral. World production of boron minerals reached an estimated 4.35 million metric tons in 2010.

Consumption of borates used in high-technical applications is expected to increase by 10% in North America and 13% in Europe by 2012. China is the largest consumer of boron, where consumption has risen by 15 percent per year from 2000 to 2010.
Borate minerals and refined borate products are used extensively worldwide in the manufacture of vitreous products such as fiberglass insulation, textile fiberglass, borosilicate glass (e.g. LCD screens), ceramic glazes and porcelain enamels.  These applications account for approximately 60 per cent of borate consumption, with detergents, fire retardants, metallurgy, agriculture, insecticides, wood preservatives and specialty products accounting for the remainder.    

Source: US Geological Survey, Report on Boron - 2010 (with 2011 update).

Market prices reflect the relative scarcity of borates with prices averaging: US$500-$700/tonne for colemanite concentrate (40% B2O3); $500-$700/tonne for ulexite (40% B2O3); $620-$900/tonne for boric acid.

Believing it could become an important part of the boron supply chain is Canadian companyErin Ventures Inc. (TSXV: EV), which is currently developing its Piskanja property in Serbia. The project’s technical report indicates a total of 3.53 million tons of pure B2O3 (Indicated and Inferred), and a near-term catalyst for the company’s share price could come from a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), which Erin Ventures expects to release sometime in the current quarter.

Boron. Most people have likely never heard of this industrial mineral yet it is used in no fewer than 500 products, including nine grams of it in the Gorilla Glass contained in every Apple iPad. It is also utilized extensively in ceramics, fibreglass insulation, fertilizer, silicon, sports equipment, nuclear reactors, lithium batteries, heat shields, and medicines. Keep up to date with breaking news, commentaries, and interviews by following Erin Ventures hereAccording to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), global consumption of B2O3 (boron trioxide) is projected to reach 2.0 million tonnes in 2014, up from 1.5 million tonnes in 2010. China is currently the world’s largest consumer of boron minerals, with demand increasing by 15% annually from 2000 to 2010. On the supply side, about 70% of the world’s annual output comes from just two industry players – Rio Tinto subsidiary U.S. Borax with its mine in California, and the government controlled Eti Mine in Turkey. This is due to the fact that economic deposits of boron are so rare. Believing it could become an important part of the boron supply chain is Canadian company Erin Ventures Inc. (TSXV: EV), which is currently developing its Piskanja property in Serbia. Company President Tim Daniels saw opportunity in Serbia, which has a long, rich history in mining, as far back as 1996 with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe the late 1980s and early 1990s. Erin owns 100% of Piskanja, in addition to an exclusive exploration license covering 35 square kilometers of the basin in which the Piskanja deposit is located.  Competitive advantages for the company include a large, high quality ore deposit, ready access to global markets, existing regional infrastructure, and excellent relationships with industry leaders.In November 2013, Erin Ventures filed a NI 43-101 technical report for Piskanja that established an Indicated Mineral Resource of 1.73 million tonnes of B2O3 (5.6 million tonne ore at 30.8%) and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 1.80 million tonnes B2O3 (6.2 million tonne at 28.8%), which Tim Daniels believes is indicative of an economic deposit. The property has 35kV electricity lines, is accessible by paved road and rail from Belgrade, and the company estimates its operating costs could be as low as $125 per tonne. Erin's technical report indicates a total of 3.53 million tons of pure B2O3 (in all categories). However, boron material is sold at 40% purity, so if Erin Ventures has 3.53 million tons of 100% B2O3, it means the company has 8.8 million tons of 40% B2O3 (sale grade).  There is also a potential to expand the resource size as the deposit remains open in two directions. As well, there is the possibility of additional deposits in the remainder of the 35 km2 basin that belongs to Erin. The company expects, as a result of further exploration in the recently announced feasibility work program, that the deposit may grow substantially. Included in Piskanja’s resource is a variety of borate minerals such as colemanite, which is a key ingredient in glass production, especially heat, scratch and impact -resistant glass such as fibreglass, and borosilicate glass (TV and device screens). Turkey is currently the only significant exporter of colemanite and thus it presents a potential opportunity for Erin Ventures, as there seems to be an appetite amongst colemanite consumers for either an alternative or supplementary supplier, this according to Mr. Daniels.       “We’re looking at (a boron) market penetration that equates to about 5% and there’s certainly a hole in the market for that sort of penetration, or more, from a good quality, low cost producer,” he said, adding that the company has been in discussions for the past two or three years with several different potential strategic partners or companies willing to enter into off take agreements, which includes some of the world’s largest borate buyers. As part of its efforts to fund its feasibility study (the next step on the way to a mine license) and turn this project into an operating mine, Erin Ventures on May 12, 2014, proposed, subject to approval by Canadian regulators, a unique hybrid investment vehicle with a royalty and share component in order to raise up to $5 million. Mr. Daniels believes this is the most cost effective course of action for the company and its shareholders given what he considers to be the project’s high cash flow potential along with its high gross margins.   For Erin Ventures’ investors, then, a near-term catalyst for its share price could come from a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), which the company expects to release sometime in the current quarter.  To learn more about Erin Ventures Inc., you can view their initiation research report, research bulletins, analyst commentaries and CEO video interview on their SmallCapPower.com Investor Hub: Here About Erin Ventures: Erin Ventures Inc.

Heads up on Erin Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: EV) (US Listing: ERVFF) where there is a remarkable situation shaping up with Boron and a very serious gold project that will be a company maker in itself, however the flagship now is Boron and we peg their project as the 3rd largest deposit in the world. Something you should know about Boron is the global supply comes from a handful of sources and the project that Erin Ventures has will make it a serious target. Rio Tinto is the only real competition and the Turkish Government (but they are not as favorable as they are plagued with arsenic), the margins are very large - this should play out well for investors involved now as the management is straight up and steady. Erin Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: EV) (US Listing: ERVFF) 100% owned Piskanja Boron deposit in Serbia is the 3rd largest boron deposit in the world and it was only very recently (August 31, 2010) returned to them as the rightful owners by the Serbian government after a 5 year hiatus. BEFORE the hiatus EV.V had a market cap of ~CDN$88M and then they only owned half the project, NOW EV.V has a market cap under CDN$15M and has 100% ownership plus they have potential near term cash flow scenarios on several fronts; needless to say with only ~123M shares outstanding and trading under CDN$0.15, shares of EV.V appear poised for significant upside revaluation. The Piskanja boron deposit has a historical (non NI 43-101 compliant) estimate of ~7.5M tonnes grading 39% B203 (boron) and it appears to Mining MarketWatch Journal from its own (non 43-101) interpretation that the probable numbers are 10 - 12M tonnes and possible 20M+. Now that Erin Ventures has regained the property, the historic tonnage is expected to be surpassed and brought compliant to NI 43-101 standards; the data from past drilling and exploration conducted by Erin Ventures and Rio Tinto was conducted to a high standard. The high grade boron deposit is currently defined in three near surface lenses (beds of boron rich mineralization - similar to how potash is found) ranging in thicknesses from 1 to 9 metres and has the advantage of (so far) being arsenic free. Erin's license covers ~3 square kilometers containing an ancient lakebed whereby the boron was deposited through volcanic activity and it is believed there should be boron throughout -- so far EV.V has explored only ~4% of that basin yet has already established the 3rd largest deposit in the world. EV.V is in active discussions with potential strategic partners of size that will be able to facilitate an end market for the boron and advance the project to fruition. Controlling interest in Santa Rosa open pit gold mine, Panama, a past producer with 60,000 oz/annum capacity facility shutdown a decade ago with then (now consider historical non 43-101) ~900,000oz proven and ~1.5M oz resource of gold at a grade averaging 1.3g/t using gold price of $350.  Near term cash flow potential from 100% owned Volujski Kljuc alluvial gold project, Serbia. Systematically drilled revealing (historic non 43-101 compliant) 29 million cubic metres of auriferous gravel grading 0.29 g Au/cubic metre from surface to bedrock. Low cost to bring operational.
