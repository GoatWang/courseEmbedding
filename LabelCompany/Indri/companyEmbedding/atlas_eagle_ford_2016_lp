PITTSBURGH, Sept. 24, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (NYSE:   ARP) ("ARP" or "the Company") announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire oil assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas for $225 million. The assets consist of 22 producing wells and 19 undeveloped locations containing estimated net reserves of approximately 12 million barrels of oil equivalent ("Mmboe"). ARP's Board of Directors has approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2014 with an effective date of July 1, 2014. The Company will pay $200 million of the purchase price upon closing, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, with the remainder of the purchase price paid in installments in 2015.
In connection with the acquisition, Atlas Energy, L.P.'s (NYSE:   ATLS) E&P development subsidiary will purchase eight wells that have been drilled but not completed and 53 undeveloped drilling locations for approximately $115 million, which is to be paid in the twelve months following closing.
Edward E. Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of ARP, stated, "This transaction demonstrates the ability of the Atlas companies to acquire high-margin production in a premier U.S. oil and gas basin without diluting common unit holders' interests. We expect this transaction to immediately enhance ARP's cash flow, distribution coverage and credit metrics, providing additional visibility and growth."
ARP will acquire oil-rich production in Atascosa County, TX, located in the oil window of the Eagle Ford Shale. The production is comprised of approximately 87% oil, 7% natural gas liquids and 6% natural gas from 22 producing wells, from which the Company expects net daily production to average approximately 1,900 barrels of oil equivalents per day ("boe/d") in 2015. ARP's oil and liquids production is expected to increase as a result of the acquisition to approximately 25% of ARP's total daily oil and gas production. In addition to the oil-producing assets, ARP will acquire 19 undeveloped drilling locations in the Eagle Ford position. The Company expects that these drilling locations will provide valuable inventory for ARP's investment partnership business. The Eagle Ford assets also have contracted agreements for gathering and processing capacity as well as salt water disposal.
Additional operating details of the assets to be acquired by ARP:

Net reserves of approximately 12 Mmboe; approximately 86% oil; 100% operated, 100% working interest (74% net revenue interest) 
Expected net daily production in 2015 of approximately 1,900 boe/d from 22 producing wells in Atascosa Co., TX 
ARP expects the entire acreage position to be held by production in the several quarters following the closing of the transaction 
Lease operating costs and production taxes of approximately $9.75 per barrel ("bbl") 
Oil transportation costs of approximately $7.00/bbl; gas gathering and processing costs of approximately $1.70 per million cubic feet
ARP intends to finance a portion of the transaction through borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. ARP will pay $200 million upon closing the transaction, subject to purchase price adjustments, and the remaining $25 million will be paid in three quarterly installments beginning March 31, 2015. The Company is also currently working with its lending group to expand the borrowing base on its revolving credit facility as a result of the transaction.
Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC acted as financial advisor on the transaction, and Jones Day and Ledgewood (Philadelphia) acted as legal advisors.
Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (NYSE:   ARP) is an exploration & production master limited partnership which owns an interest in over 14,000 producing natural gas and oil wells, located primarily in Appalachia, the Barnett Shale (TX), the Mississippi Lime (OK), the Raton Basin (NM), Black Warrior Basin (AL) and the oil-rich Rangely Field (CO).  ARP is also the largest sponsor of natural gas and oil investment partnerships in the U.S. For more information, please visit our website at www.atlasresourcepartners.com, or contact Investor Relations at InvestorRelations@atlasenergy.com.
Atlas Energy, L.P. (NYSE:   ATLS) is a master limited partnership which owns all of the general partner Class A units and incentive distribution rights and an approximate 28% limited partner interest in its upstream oil & gas subsidiary, Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. Additionally, Atlas Energy owns and operates the general partner of its midstream oil & gas subsidiary, Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P., through all of the general partner interest, all the incentive distribution rights and an approximate 6% limited partner interest.  For more information, please visit our website at www.atlasenergy.com, or contact Investor Relations at InvestorRelations@atlasenergy.com.

Trial Shale Daily & Daily GPI






	Atlas Resource Partners LP (ARP), with holdings in several shale plays across the country, drilled and completed its first three wells in the Eagle Ford Shale during the third quarter as it continues to weather low commodity prices.

	On Tuesday, the master limited partnership (MLP) reported that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization fell 21.4% year/year, from $86.7 million in 3Q2014 to $68.1 million.

	ARP said average net production totaled 264.2 MMcfe/d in 3Q2015, a 2.4% decrease from a year ago (270.8 MMcfe/d). The latest total included 216.4 MMcf/d of natural gas, 4,842 b/d of crude oil and 3,121 b/d of natural gas liquids (NGL).

	Total production fell in several of Atlas’s operating areas between 3Q2014 and 3Q2015. Declines were recorded in Appalachia (down 12.8%, from 40.7 to 36.1 MMcfe/d), the Barnett Shale (down 29.7%, from 82.5 to 58 MMcfe/d), and other operating areas (down 4.5%, from 5.3 to 5.1 MMcfe/d). Coalbed methane production was also down 8.3%, from 140.2 to 128.6 MMcfe/d.

	But production climbed 39.2% in the Eagle Ford (from 17 MMcfe/d to 23.6 MMcfe/d) and 5.2% in the Mississippi Lime (from 12.1 MMcfe/d to 12.7 MMcfe/d).

	ARP reported total revenue of $257.9 million for 3Q2015, a 24.8% increase over 3Q2014 ($206.7 million). But the partnership incurred an asset impairment of $672.2 million, which created an operating loss of $535.3 million, compared with operating income of $18.6 million in 3Q2014. The impairment was attributed to certain oil and gas properties due to recent declines in forward commodity prices.

	During an earnings conference call on Tuesday, ARP President Mark Schumacher said 4Q2015 production would be affected by a decision to shut in some Marcellus Shale production, due to low commodity prices and the sale of its nonoperated interest in the County Line field in Wyoming. Together, those actions amount to 8 MMcf/d of production.

	ARP drilled and completed its first three wells in the Eagle Ford during 3Q2015. Previous wells had been drilled by a former operator. He later added that in order to reduce drilling times, the MLP was employing a multi-well pad development, with a top oil rig to set surface casing to about 3,500 feet.

	"We have seen significant savings in the drilling and completion costs due to process efficiencies as well as vendor cost reductions," Schumacher said. "The average drill time for our recently drilled wells has averaged 13 days, which has been reduced by three days compared to previously drilled wells."

	ARP also added about 3,000 bolt-on acres in the Eagle Ford and connected two wells in the Mississippian Lime during 3Q2015.

	ARP CEO Daniel Herz said while energy companies on the whole have been unable to attract new capital amid low commodity prices, the MLP is poised to "weather this type of storm for an extended period of time," largely because the company has about 90% of its projected margin protected through 2018, with additional protection extending into 2019.

	According to Herz, ARP has shallow decline assets, hedges with a current positive hedge book value of about $360 million, and assets with low operating costs. ARP also has an investment partnership business, which provides the MLP with annual income from thousands of wells that aren't affected by commodity prices.

	Atlas Energy Group LLC (ATLS) owns 100% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights of ARP. ATLS also owns 25 million ARP units.

	During Tuesday's call, ATLS CEO Edward Cohen said the ARP parent company had successfully refinanced its debt, entering into an agreement for a term loan facility of $82.7 million that matures in August 2020.

	ARP as of June held about 1.47 million net acres in the U.S. onshore, including 696,000 net developed acres and 776,000 net undeveloped acres. The MLP also had about 14,000 producing wells, with operations in 12 states.
