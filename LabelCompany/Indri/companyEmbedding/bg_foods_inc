		The rock maple, hard maple, or sugar maple tree (acer 
        saccharum) are the sources of the sap which is converted to Maple Syrup. 
        Any sugar maple with a trunk diameter of 12 inches or more can be "tapped" 
        for making syrup. It takes thirty years for a maple tree to grow to that 
        size.
