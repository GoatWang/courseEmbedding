Photo: Benny Chan Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. chose to relocate to a new 14,000ft2 location in El Segundo, California, to create a modern, welcoming space with an executive feel. The new office spans one floor, providing space for 27 staff, conference rooms, teaming rooms, executive offices, guest offices, a café, and break room. The design team from IA Interior Architects worked with Aerojet Rocketdyne staff to create a modern and welcoming space reflective of the mature and conservative company culture. Natural and muted colors are used with wood finish accents, providing a blank canvas to highlight branded signage, company colors, and product exhibits such as an actual-size rocket motor with explanatory plaque in reception. Incorporating Aerojet Rocketdyne’s brand colors throughout the workspace creates brand identity and recall for the company and its customers. Red and blue accents on chairs and in logos are consistent yet subtle, and custom wall graphics integrate brand messaging throughout the physical space. Floor-to-ceiling-height glass and continuous glass partitions thread through reception, work, and meeting spaces to create a transparent and collaborative atmosphere. Maximum natural light opens the space to a welcoming and community-based destination. A long hallway leading to offices provides a gallery space to display representations of the company’s visions and business. The design team created a graphic wall concept for various topics, including a defense wall, space wall, values wall, brand wall, applied ingenuity wall, and video wall to exhibit Aerojet Rocketdyne. These private offices host the company executives and their assistants, the only staff at this location. Office furniture is custom designed to meet the client’s desired appearance and function. Amenity spaces include two main break rooms and an Aerospace Lounge. Given the client’s interest in incorporating audio and visual components, electronic features are integrated in every space. Upon entry to the reception area, guests are greeted with a video wall displaying clips of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s company vision and products. Rooms throughout of the office maintain restricted access with card readers necessary for entry. The main conference room has six large monitors, each spanning 65" diagonally, connected to the main computer system to allow virtual brainstorming and training sessions. Conference rooms and board rooms also contain large customized tables that provide power and data access at every seat.

AJRD - Stock Valuation Report
 Trade 

Shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. (AJRD) broke into a new 52-week high yesterday, hitting a peak of $23.39. 
Shares closed at $23.22 after opening at $23.06 for a move of 0.91%. The company now has a market cap of $1.73 billion.

Investors and traders can learn a lot about a stock’s momentum when it sets a new 52-week high. As an example, bullish investors view a company hitting its highest price in a year as a sign of 
momentum and may interpret it as a signal to buy. On the other hand, bearish investors could view a new 52-week high as a signal of the end of a strong run, with the stock possibly peaking out 
before an impending period of decline.


For Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc., the new 52-week high came on volume of 321,289. The stock has a float of 74.5 million shares and average daily volume of $448,382. It has a 
50-day SMA of $21.37 and a 200-day SMA of $20.02. Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. now has a P/E ratio of 84.7.

History[edit]
Background[edit]
Main article: General Tire and Rubber Company
Several decades after it began manufacturing rubber products, General Tire diversified into broadcasting and aeronautics.
In the 1940s, the Aerojet company began experimenting with various rocket designs. For a solid-fuel rocket, they needed binders, and turned to General Rubber for assistance. General became a partner in the company.
Radio broadcasting began with the purchase of several radio networks starting in 1943. In 1952, its purchase of WOR-TV expanded the broadcast business into television. In 1953, General bought the RKO Radio Pictures movie studio. All of its media and entertainment holdings were organized into the RKO General division.
Due to the studio and rocket businesses, General came to own a great deal of property in California. Its internal facilities management unit began commercializing its operations, landing General in the real estate business. This started when Aerojet-General Corporation acquired approximately 12,600 acres (51 km2) of land in Eastern Sacramento County. Aerojet converted these former gold fields into one of the premier rocket manufacturing and testing facilities in the Western world. However, most of this land was used to provide safe buffer zones for Aerojet's testing and manufacturing operations. Later, as the need for these facilities and safety zones decreased, the property became available for other uses. Located 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Sacramento along US Highway 50, the properties were valuable, being in a key growth corridor in the region. Approximately 6,000 acres (24 km2) of the Aerojet lands are now being planned as a community called Easton. Easton Development Company LLC was formed to assist in the process.[3]
Name change[edit]
In 1984, General created a parent holding company, GenCorp, for its various businesses. The main subsidiaries were:

General Tire
broadcaster RKO General
Diversitech General, a manufacturer of tennis balls and polymer products including automotive soundproofing and home wallpapers
defense contractor Aerojet.

Through its RKO General subsidiary, the company also held stakes in:

Frontier Airlines
RKO bottlers, which operated Pepsi-Cola distributorships
several resorts and hotels, including the Westward Look resort in Tucson, Arizona

Disconglomeration[edit]
Faced with a hostile takeover attempt, among other difficulties, GenCorp shed some of its long-held units in the late 1980s.
RKO General ran into difficulties with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during license renewal proceedings in the late 1980s. The FCC was reluctant to renew the broadcast licenses, due to widespread lying to advertisers and regulators. As a result of the protracted proceedings, GenCorp sold RKO General's broadcast properties beginning in 1987.
GenCorp also sold its former flagship, General Tire, to German tire maker Continental AG in order to concentrate on Aerojet.
In 1999, GenCorp spun off its Decorative & Building Products and Performance Chemicals businesses. GenCorp formed OMNOVA Solutions, Inc. into a separate, publicly traded company, and transferred those businesses into it.
GenCorp's two remaining businesses, as of 2008, are Aerojet and real estate.[4]
Aeronautics expansion[edit]
In July 2012, GenCorp agreed to buy rocket engine producer Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne from United Technologies Corporation for $550 million.[5][6][7] The FTC approved the deal on June 10, 2013, and it closed on June 17.[8] [9][10][11]
Pension and bond problems[edit]

GenCorp withdrew its over-funded pension during the real estate boom years of 2006 and 2007. The real estate bust caused an underfunding of the pension plan of over $300 million. This caused a freeze of its pension plan on Feb. 1 2009 and an end to 401k match on Jan 15 2009. The move was expected to save the company 29 million a year.[12]
The under funded pension gave the company a negative net worth of -6.88 per share as of 30 November 2009.
GenCorp also is holding $142.80 million in 4% bonds due in 2010 and $147.70 million in bonds due in 2011 that the company expects to have to repurchase, as of the 2008 Annual Report. "In December 2009, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.0625% convertible subordinated debentures ("4 1/16% Debentures") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under the Securities Act of 1933. Issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures generated net proceeds of approximately $195.0 million, a portion of which were used to repurchase $124.7 million of the 4% Notes in January 2010. The remaining proceeds will be used to redeem a portion of the 9½% senior subordinatednotes ("9½% Notes"); pay accrued interest on the 4% Notes and 9½% Notes; and pay other debt issuance costs. "[13]
In March 2010 Gencorp amended a $280 million revolving line of credit [14]
GenCorp's former CEO J. Scott Neish resigned on Jan. 6 2010. He had been interim CEO from March 2008 (Terry J Hall resigned) head of the Aerojet division since November 2005. The new CEO was placed in as permanent and J. Scott Neish elected to resign from Aerojet. Scott Seymour had been the head of Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems from 2002 to 2008.[15]
GenCorp since 2008 has had significant changes in its Board of Directors and Corporate Officers, per the 2008 Annual Report:
"On March 5, 2008, Terry L. Hall resigned as a Director and as our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Board appointed three new Directors. The Board appointed J. Scott Neish, our Vice President and President of Aerojet, to serve as our interim Chief Executive Officer and President, pending the results of a search to identify qualified candidates to fill this position on a permanent basis. On May 15, 2008, Timothy A.Wicks, Chairman of the Board, Todd R. Snyder and Sheila E. Widnall resigned as Directors of the Company. Our Board of Directors appointed James H. Perry and Thomas A. Corcoran as new Directors on May 16, 2008, and September 25, 2008, respectively. On September 29, 2008, Yasmin R. Seyal, our former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and R. Leon Blackburn, our former Vice President, Controller left the Company and our Board appointed Kathleen E. Redd, Vice President, Finance of Aerojet, to serve as our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary."
Nuclear Controversy[edit]
In 2008, the Government Pension Fund of Norway withdrew its investments in GenCorp due to production of nuclear weapons.[16] As of 2015, there has been no change to this status.

History[edit]
Background[edit]
Main article: General Tire and Rubber Company
Several decades after it began manufacturing rubber products, General Tire diversified into broadcasting and aeronautics.
In the 1940s, the Aerojet company began experimenting with various rocket designs. For a solid-fuel rocket, they needed binders, and turned to General Rubber for assistance. General became a partner in the company.
Radio broadcasting began with the purchase of several radio networks starting in 1943. In 1952, its purchase of WOR-TV expanded the broadcast business into television. In 1953, General bought the RKO Radio Pictures movie studio. All of its media and entertainment holdings were organized into the RKO General division.
Due to the studio and rocket businesses, General came to own a great deal of property in California. Its internal facilities management unit began commercializing its operations, landing General in the real estate business. This started when Aerojet-General Corporation acquired approximately 12,600 acres (51 km2) of land in Eastern Sacramento County. Aerojet converted these former gold fields into one of the premier rocket manufacturing and testing facilities in the Western world. However, most of this land was used to provide safe buffer zones for Aerojet's testing and manufacturing operations. Later, as the need for these facilities and safety zones decreased, the property became available for other uses. Located 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Sacramento along US Highway 50, the properties were valuable, being in a key growth corridor in the region. Approximately 6,000 acres (24 km2) of the Aerojet lands are now being planned as a community called Easton. Easton Development Company LLC was formed to assist in the process.[3]
Name change[edit]
In 1984, General created a parent holding company, GenCorp, for its various businesses. The main subsidiaries were:

General Tire
broadcaster RKO General
Diversitech General, a manufacturer of tennis balls and polymer products including automotive soundproofing and home wallpapers
defense contractor Aerojet.

Through its RKO General subsidiary, the company also held stakes in:

Frontier Airlines
RKO bottlers, which operated Pepsi-Cola distributorships
several resorts and hotels, including the Westward Look resort in Tucson, Arizona

Disconglomeration[edit]
Faced with a hostile takeover attempt, among other difficulties, GenCorp shed some of its long-held units in the late 1980s.
RKO General ran into difficulties with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during license renewal proceedings in the late 1980s. The FCC was reluctant to renew the broadcast licenses, due to widespread lying to advertisers and regulators. As a result of the protracted proceedings, GenCorp sold RKO General's broadcast properties beginning in 1987.
GenCorp also sold its former flagship, General Tire, to German tire maker Continental AG in order to concentrate on Aerojet.
In 1999, GenCorp spun off its Decorative & Building Products and Performance Chemicals businesses. GenCorp formed OMNOVA Solutions, Inc. into a separate, publicly traded company, and transferred those businesses into it.
GenCorp's two remaining businesses, as of 2008, are Aerojet and real estate.[4]
Aeronautics expansion[edit]
In July 2012, GenCorp agreed to buy rocket engine producer Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne from United Technologies Corporation for $550 million.[5][6][7] The FTC approved the deal on June 10, 2013, and it closed on June 17.[8] [9][10][11]
Pension and bond problems[edit]





This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. No cleanup reason has been specified. Please help improve this section if you can. (February 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


GenCorp withdrew its over-funded pension during the real estate boom years of 2006 and 2007. The real estate bust caused an underfunding of the pension plan of over $300 million. This caused a freeze of its pension plan on Feb. 1 2009 and an end to 401k match on Jan 15 2009. The move was expected to save the company 29 million a year.[12]
The under funded pension gave the company a negative net worth of -6.88 per share as of 30 November 2009.
GenCorp also is holding $142.80 million in 4% bonds due in 2010 and $147.70 million in bonds due in 2011 that the company expects to have to repurchase, as of the 2008 Annual Report. "In December 2009, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.0625% convertible subordinated debentures ("4 1/16% Debentures") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under the Securities Act of 1933. Issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures generated net proceeds of approximately $195.0 million, a portion of which were used to repurchase $124.7 million of the 4% Notes in January 2010. The remaining proceeds will be used to redeem a portion of the 9½% senior subordinatednotes ("9½% Notes"); pay accrued interest on the 4% Notes and 9½% Notes; and pay other debt issuance costs. "[13]
In March 2010 Gencorp amended a $280 million revolving line of credit [14]
GenCorp's former CEO J. Scott Neish resigned on Jan. 6 2010. He had been interim CEO from March 2008 (Terry J Hall resigned) head of the Aerojet division since November 2005. The new CEO was placed in as permanent and J. Scott Neish elected to resign from Aerojet. Scott Seymour had been the head of Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems from 2002 to 2008.[15]
GenCorp since 2008 has had significant changes in its Board of Directors and Corporate Officers, per the 2008 Annual Report:
"On March 5, 2008, Terry L. Hall resigned as a Director and as our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Board appointed three new Directors. The Board appointed J. Scott Neish, our Vice President and President of Aerojet, to serve as our interim Chief Executive Officer and President, pending the results of a search to identify qualified candidates to fill this position on a permanent basis. On May 15, 2008, Timothy A.Wicks, Chairman of the Board, Todd R. Snyder and Sheila E. Widnall resigned as Directors of the Company. Our Board of Directors appointed James H. Perry and Thomas A. Corcoran as new Directors on May 16, 2008, and September 25, 2008, respectively. On September 29, 2008, Yasmin R. Seyal, our former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and R. Leon Blackburn, our former Vice President, Controller left the Company and our Board appointed Kathleen E. Redd, Vice President, Finance of Aerojet, to serve as our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary."
Nuclear Controversy[edit]
In 2008, the Government Pension Fund of Norway withdrew its investments in GenCorp due to production of nuclear weapons.[16] As of 2015, there has been no change to this status.
