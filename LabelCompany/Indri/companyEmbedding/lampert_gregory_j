General Cable Announces Gregory J. Lampert To Lead Operations In The Americas






Business Wire




Jan 23, 2013 4:20 PM EST













 




























































  General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) (the Company) is pleased to announce Gregory J. Lampert will assume responsibility for all the Company’s operations in the Americas, which includes Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean as well as Central/South America, effective immediately. General Cable is an industry leader in the Americas with expected annual revenue in the range of $4.5 billion.  Mr. Lampert joined General Cable in 1998 and has held leadership roles touching nearly every aspect of the business. He has served as Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive Officer for General Cable North America since 2008 and is a member of the Company’s Global Operating Committee. He previously was Executive Vice President and Group President, North American Electrical and Communications Infrastructure since 2007. Prior to that, from 2004 to 2007, he was Vice President and General Manager of Carol® Brand products.  Mr. Lampert holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati and an MBA with concentrations in Strategy, Finance and Marketing from the University of Chicago. He is a member of the Board of Directors of Xtek, Inc, a manufacturer of specialty goods for the steel and aluminum industries.  Chief Executive Officer Gregory B. Kenny stated, “I have worked closely with Greg over the last 15 years. He has an in-depth knowledge of our major product lines and functional disciplines. As a member of the Global Operating Committee for the last five years, Greg has helped set strategy and played a key role in the acquisition and integration of Alcan Cable North America and Prestolite Wire. Together, these acquisitions represent more than $800 million of annual revenue. I am confident under Greg’s leadership, we will further advance our strategy of bringing more complex products to rapidly industrializing countries while increasing regional intra-company trade which will enhance our ability to provide seamless customer service. At the same time, we will be better positioned to leverage learning and rapidly share best practices throughout the Americas which will improve our ability to realize savings over time.”

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
