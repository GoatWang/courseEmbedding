Mark Landecker: First Pacific Advisors



A self-described stock geek, Mark Landecker has been following companies since grade school. After leaving private equity to manage global equities for the family office of Barry Diller, and later at Kinney Asset Management, Mark was recruited to First Pacific Advisors. He now co-manages the firm’s signature Crescent Fund and runs the FPA Global Opportunity Fund. Over the last decade, Mark has made himself into an expert on the great franchise companies of the world, waiting for the exceedingly rare moments when they get cheap.  Those management teams subject to Mark’s rigorous research say he is among the best informed analysts they have ever come across. Mark, who has never spoken at a conference, will share insights about what makes a company great and share a specific idea.
