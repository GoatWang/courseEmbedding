Professional Profile
James Beard is an intellectual property associate in the San Francisco office of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, where his practice focuses on patent litigation. James has experience throughout the litigation process, including pre-filing counseling, motion practice, claim construction, and pre-trial and trial work, as well as post-trial motion practice and appeal. Before complaints are filed, James has worked with clients to give pre-litigation analysis and advice, and has provided general licensing and litigation counseling for clients.
James’ experience includes representations involving a wide range of technologies, including computer science and signal processing, biotechnology and medical devices, and consumer products. James has represented clients in numerous Federal forums, from district courts and the International Trade Commission, to the Court of International Trade and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.

Representative Matters
Represented a manufacturer of HVAC equipment as a defendant in a patent infringement action in the Northern District of California. Managed discovery and briefed critical discovery disputes after Kirkland took over the case from another firm following the close of discovery and successfully argued for the Court to re-open discovery. Those discovery efforts resulted in the identification of key prior art contained in the Plaintiff’s own files. Assisted in depositions of witnesses and all aspects of briefing leading up to an eight-day jury trial, which resulted in a final verdict of non-infringement in favor of the client and an additional verdicts of invalidity of the majority of the asserted patent claims in light of the prior art that was discovered in Plaintiff’s files. The case was featured in several articles, including Law360, “Energy Labs Cleared By Jury In Nortek Patent Dispute” (August 10, 2016).
Represented a manufacturer of protective cases for smart phones in a multi-forum patent dispute that included litigations in district court, the International Trade Commission, and the Court of International Trade, which resulted in an amicable resolution. Developed invalidity and infringement arguments. Assisted with all aspects of briefing across the forums, and with oral argument for claim construction before the ITC.
Prior to joining Kirkland, James was involved in representations including:
Represented a manufacturer of protective cases for smart phones in a multi-district patent and trademark dispute. Developed infringement arguments and assisted with all aspects of fact discovery. The matter resolved in a finding of trademark infringement in favor of client.
Represented a computer manufacturer in a patent infringement dispute, ending in a stipulation of dismissal. Responsible for developing invalidity defenses and briefed summary judgment motion.
Represented an inventor in a Federal Circuit appeal. Assisted in briefing and preparations for oral arguments. The matter resolved with an affirmation in favor of client.

The Kirkland Signature Story





    It's been nearly 20 years since the first Kirkland Signature™ products appeared at Costco. Has this line of private-label products achieved its goal of offering members a unique value in their everyday purchases?


    Absolutely. The Kirkland Signature label today appears on about 20 percent of the products you find in your local warehouse - on everything from men's dress shirts to laundry detergent, pet food to toilet paper, canned foods to cookware, olive oil to beer, automotive products to health and beauty aids. The common element: These are Costco's signature products that offer the perfect combination of quality and price to members.

 

    "We will always be known for name brands such as Michelin, Sony and Crest," says Craig Jelinek, Costco president and chief executive officer, "but we will continue to augment our product offerings with our own Kirkland Signature items."
    








    With Kirkland Signature, Costco can develop new products, new categories and new products in existing categories, which allows the company to control the quality of the Kirkland Signature product and drive down prices on competing national brands. 
         
    "The working rule followed by Costco buyers is that all Kirkland Signature products must be equal to or better than the national brands, and must offer a savings to our members," adds Craig.

    Another rule is continuous improvement. "We're constantly looking at Kirkland Signature items, revisiting them with an eye to making them better," says Jeff Lyons, Costco's senior vice president of fresh foods.

    On your next trip to Costco, compare any Kirkland Signature product with its brand name counterpart, and discover a great perk of Costco.
