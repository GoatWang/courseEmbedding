FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

NAVIGATING THE DOL FIDUCIARY RULE

Resources for building better portfolios after the rule

The BlackRock Investment Institute
Midyear investment outlook
Jul 10, 2017



By BlackRock Investment Institute








 







The global economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the post-crisis trend. In fact, our BlackRock GPS suggests G7 growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts. Investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds.






 

Three themes to consider







 Sustained expansion



We believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon. The economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on.








 Rethinking risk



Low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself. Placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign.








 Rethinking returns



Long-term bond yields are likely to remain low. This suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages.














1. Sustained expansion
The current U.S. economic cycle has been unusually long, sparking fears that it may die of old age. We have a different take. Looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on. Its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years, not quarters.
Room to runComparison of U.S. economic cycles from peaks to troughs, 1953-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from U.S. BEA, Congressional Budget Office, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), July 2017. Notes: This chart compares real U.S. GDP with other cycles. Each line begins with the previous cycle’s peak, as determined by the NBER. We align the cycles based on their peaks, troughs and the point when potential output is reached. For details, see our interactive graphic at blackrockblog.com/cycles-in-context.
If growth persists for some time and valuations on stocks are more reasonable than historical averages suggest, the biggest danger investors face may be a premature flight to safety. Indeed, we believe the old adage holds: make hay while the sun is shining.


Take action: Stick to your guns in stocks
A sharp earnings recovery is supporting equities globally. We favor markets outside the U.S. and the  momentum style factor.

2. Rethinking risk
Much noise has been made around recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the VIX for the S&P 500 and MOVE for U.S. Treasuries. For some, this calm is causing consternation: Surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels? However, this popular line of reasoning features a flaw: Markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign.
Low volatility ... with a long tailDistribution of realized monthly U.S. equity volatility, 1872-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Robert Shiller, June 2017. Notes: Realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in U.S. equities over a rolling 12-month period. Bars show the number of months at each level of volatility. Each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility. For example, the bar marked 10–12 shows that volatility was between 10% and 12% for 369 months.
This isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted. Spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors. However, a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat. As neither looks imminent (at least as we parse the signals), dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills.


Take action: Keep calm but hedge on
Pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent risk management play. More flexible, actively-managed strategies may help investors navigate fixed income markets in flux.

3. Rethinking returns
Expectations in the U.S. of imminent fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending sent the 10-year Treasury yield soaring in early 2017 only to fall back over the course of the year. While we still believe bond yields will march higher over time, structural factors such as aging populations and high debt levels should cap any yield rise to levels well below pre-crisis norms. Naturally, it could be a bumpy road along the way.
Low yields matterDeveloped market real rates, neutral rates and trend growth, 1992-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from the Federal Reserve, U.S. BEA, Eurostat, Statistics Canada and Japan Cabinet Office, July 2017. Notes: This chart shows the GDP-weighted averages of 1 estimates of the neutral rate, called r*; 2 estimates of trend GDP growth rates, and; 3 the real short-term rate for the U.S., Japan, eurozone, UK and Canada. Data are through February 2017. For more details, see our Global macro outlook of November 2016 at blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-macro-outlook-november-2016.pdf.
This has an important equity market corollary. If, as we believe, bond yields remain low, financial logic suggests valuations on stocks could remain elevated for some time: A lower discount rate applied to future earnings will simply elevate their present value. And earnings momentum is strong across the world. This means stocks can sustain seemingly lofty multiples for longer than expected as long as bond yields are held down.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.






Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.






Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






There can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics ("factors"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.






Asset allocation strategies do not assure profit and do not protect against loss.






Buying and selling shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions.






This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding the funds or any issuer or security in particular. The services described are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy.

Operating as a fiduciary






 




Building portfolios as a fiduciary requires deep understanding of your clients’ objectives in order to appropriately balance the risks and costs they may face. You may need a defendable and repeatable process to answer the pivotal question:Is this decision in the best interest of my client?



Not an all-inclusive illustration of the components ofthe portfolio construction process used by a financial advisor.











Objectives: This process starts with a deep understanding of a client’s specific objectives. When you spend the extra time to help them make better financial decisions, you solidify your relationships and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge. BlackRock has resources to guide you through these conversations and to assist you create a transparent, documented process. Lay the foundation with our objective-setting worksheets.


Risks: It’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions: How much risk should be taken, and what types of risk are tolerable in the portfolio. These two questions should be used dynamically when working with clients to regularly align their objectives with the amount of risk they are willing to take to achieve them. Discover how we see and analyze risk.


Costs: Portfolio costs come in two categories: fees (transaction costs and management fees) and taxes. Each of these eat into the returns a portfolio generates. Advisors that build a documented cost budget into their portfolio construction process can limit the impact of this erosion and ensure they are incurring costs only when justified. Learn how to capture the best value across investments.






 























View Transcript


You’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular check-ups. And you know that, to be healthier, you SHOULD do those things. But what if there was a regulation that said you MUST do those things. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding.
As ERISA fiduciaries, advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances. Because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives. When you look deeper, spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving, spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships, make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge.
*Research from Morningstar shows that investors who make intelligent financial planning decisions achieve better outcomes. They call it portfolio “gamma.” And, as a fiduciary, working to deeply understand client objectives … and regularly affirming those objectives ... may be the most important thing you do with clients. This is where you can add significant value … or gamma … to the client relationship.
Consider a process where you start by understanding the future purpose of the client’s money. Why are they investing? How much to they need? In what timeframe?
Then, assess different actions a client may need to take over time in order to achieve their desired goals. Do they need to work longer, spend less, or modify how they’re investing?
You and your client need to know their current cash flow to help determine how much … or how much more … they can save and invest. And, if retirement is the primary goal, understanding future cash flow can be more complicated.
Part of complying with DOL’s new regulation is having a documented process … that is transparent … to help address each client objective.
If your firm has a form for this, please use it. However, if not, BlackRock has resources to guide you through your process – including several worksheets that you can access here – to help you demonstrate your value proposition, add gamma to your client relationships AND meet your obligations as a fiduciary.










Understanding the DOL rule
The Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule, also known as the “conflict of interest” rule, extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets, including IRAs.

As a fiduciary under ERISA, it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client.
At its core, the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their client's best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest.

Many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the DOL rule. Regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact.
Read the full rule and exemptions here.
When will the DoL rule apply and what does that mean?
The fiduciary standard within the DOL fiduciary rule goes into effect on June 9, 2017. Full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until January 1, 2018.
The delay will allow the DOL to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard. Furthermore, the SEC has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts, which may impact the rule’s full implementation.


In the transition period between June 9 and January 1, advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts, which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors' best interest, receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions.
Between now and January 1, the DOL said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact.


What does it mean to be an ERISA fiduciary? Are there exceptions under the rule?
ERISA fiduciaries must comply with ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available. In other words, simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible. Intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program, absent a specific exemption.

Absent an exemption, prohibited transactions under ERISA include:

Dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account.
Acting on both sides of a transaction.
Receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets.



The fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions, and one is particularly important:

The Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption allows ERISA fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments (i.e., receive variable compensation) provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “Impartial Conduct Standard.”

To rely on the BIC and provide advice relating to IRA accounts, an advisor and firm must:

Act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation.
Not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services.
Provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers.
Not prohibit clients from engaging in class-action litigation to resolve claims. 
Enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more.

The disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until January 1, 2018.

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock MuniYield Quality Fund III, Inc.’s (MYI) (the 'Fund') investment objective is to provide shareholders with as high a level of current income
exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its investment policies and prudent investment management. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment
objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in municipal obligations exempt from federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject
to the federal alternative minimum tax). Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in long-term municipal obligations that are investment
grade quality at the time of investment. The Fund may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

as of 25-Jul-2017



5.69%




Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

as of 21-Jul-2017



9.98%




Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

UPDATE 3-Low-fee BlackRock funds reel in cash but earnings disappoint

Trevor Hunnicutt

Monday, 17 Jul 2017 | 11:27  AM ETReuters



SHARES











(Adds analyst quote, background on fee cuts)
NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's second-quarter results failed to impress Wall Street on Monday as the world's biggest asset manager cut fees to lure a wave of investor cash into its exchange-traded funds, sending shares down 3 percent.
Investors of all types have been piling into ETFs and dumping more expensive alternatives, and BlackRock's fees have raced toward zero on some products while competitors like Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp offer ETFs at or near the cost of managing them.

The New York-based company's largely index-tracking iShares ETFs pulled in a record $74 billion during the most recent quarter, up from $16 billion a year earlier. Overall flows totaled $104 billion, compared to just $7 billion a year ago.
Assets under management jumped 16 percent to nearly $5.7 trillion, but revenue gained just 6 percent to $2.97 billion and earnings per share rose 10 percent to $5.22, or $5.24 after adjusting for non-recurring items and other charges.
That fell short of analysts' average target of $5.40 per share and $3.02 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and the company acknowledged that fees were lighter due to "previously announced pricing changes."
The company's shares were last down just over 3 percent at $425.12 on Monday morning.
BlackRock announced a major cut for its ETFs last October and just last week lowered fees to $9 a year from $27 for every $10,000 an investor holds on a $10 billion iShares mortgage-backed securities ETF.
BlackRock Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin said on a conference call that the company has recouped "over 75 percent" of lost revenue from the October fee cuts due to growth.
The company also expects more money to roll into the MBS fund as the Federal Reserve is expected to let its own holdings roll off its balance sheet starting this year.
Already benefiting from a move by advisers to use low-fee products, BlackRock has been looking for growth from burgeoning groups of clients, such as insurers.
Chief Executive Larry Fink said on a conference call with analysts that the ETF industry's growth potential reminded him of his younger days in the 1970s developing the mortgage-backed securities market.
Yet Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders told Reuters he had expected higher revenues in part because international markets performed strongly during the quarter and BlackRock can charge higher fees on products focused abroad.
"If there ever was a quarter for this to work out, it was this quarter," said Sanders, discussing the revenue shortfall. "The trend is here to stay, and it's going to bleed out."
BlackRock's revenue has not topped analysts' estimates since the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Revenues were lower in part because "episodic" performance fees had declined, Fink told Reuters. Higher-cost actively managed products earn those fees only when they beat their targets.
Fink also touted technology and risk management fees that rose 12 percent to $164 million.
"All the drivers that we really control that can grow quarter over quarter over quarter - the momentum is accelerating, not decelerating," Fink said.
"When you think about where we're taking the firm we're very happy."
BlackRock's net income rose 8.6 percent to $857 million.

FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

NAVIGATING THE DOL FIDUCIARY RULE

The BlackRock Investment Institute
Midyear investment outlook
Jul 10, 2017



By BlackRock Investment Institute








 







The global economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the post-crisis trend. In fact, our BlackRock GPS suggests G7 growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts. Investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds.






 

Three themes to consider







 Sustained expansion



We believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon. The economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on.








 Rethinking risk



Low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself. Placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign.








 Rethinking returns



Long-term bond yields are likely to remain low. This suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages.














1. Sustained expansion
The current U.S. economic cycle has been unusually long, sparking fears that it may die of old age. We have a different take. Looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on. Its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years, not quarters.
Room to runComparison of U.S. economic cycles from peaks to troughs, 1953-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from U.S. BEA, Congressional Budget Office, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), July 2017. Notes: This chart compares real U.S. GDP with other cycles. Each line begins with the previous cycle’s peak, as determined by the NBER. We align the cycles based on their peaks, troughs and the point when potential output is reached. For details, see our interactive graphic at blackrockblog.com/cycles-in-context.
If growth persists for some time and valuations on stocks are more reasonable than historical averages suggest, the biggest danger investors face may be a premature flight to safety. Indeed, we believe the old adage holds: make hay while the sun is shining.


Take action: Stick to your guns in stocks
A sharp earnings recovery is supporting equities globally. We favor markets outside the U.S. and the  momentum style factor.

2. Rethinking risk
Much noise has been made around recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the VIX for the S&P 500 and MOVE for U.S. Treasuries. For some, this calm is causing consternation: Surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels? However, this popular line of reasoning features a flaw: Markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign.
Low volatility ... with a long tailDistribution of realized monthly U.S. equity volatility, 1872-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Robert Shiller, June 2017. Notes: Realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in U.S. equities over a rolling 12-month period. Bars show the number of months at each level of volatility. Each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility. For example, the bar marked 10–12 shows that volatility was between 10% and 12% for 369 months.
This isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted. Spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors. However, a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat. As neither looks imminent (at least as we parse the signals), dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills.


Take action: Keep calm but hedge on
Pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent risk management play. More flexible, actively-managed strategies may help investors navigate fixed income markets in flux.

3. Rethinking returns
Expectations in the U.S. of imminent fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending sent the 10-year Treasury yield soaring in early 2017 only to fall back over the course of the year. While we still believe bond yields will march higher over time, structural factors such as aging populations and high debt levels should cap any yield rise to levels well below pre-crisis norms. Naturally, it could be a bumpy road along the way.
Low yields matterDeveloped market real rates, neutral rates and trend growth, 1992-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from the Federal Reserve, U.S. BEA, Eurostat, Statistics Canada and Japan Cabinet Office, July 2017. Notes: This chart shows the GDP-weighted averages of 1 estimates of the neutral rate, called r*; 2 estimates of trend GDP growth rates, and; 3 the real short-term rate for the U.S., Japan, eurozone, UK and Canada. Data are through February 2017. For more details, see our Global macro outlook of November 2016 at blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-macro-outlook-november-2016.pdf.
This has an important equity market corollary. If, as we believe, bond yields remain low, financial logic suggests valuations on stocks could remain elevated for some time: A lower discount rate applied to future earnings will simply elevate their present value. And earnings momentum is strong across the world. This means stocks can sustain seemingly lofty multiples for longer than expected as long as bond yields are held down.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.






Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.






Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






There can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics ("factors"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.






Asset allocation strategies do not assure profit and do not protect against loss.






Buying and selling shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions.






This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding the funds or any issuer or security in particular.

Operating as a fiduciary






 




Building portfolios as a fiduciary requires deep understanding of your clients’ objectives in order to appropriately balance the risks and costs they may face. You may need a defendable and repeatable process to answer the pivotal question:Is this decision in the best interest of my client?



Not an all-inclusive illustration of the components ofthe portfolio construction process used by a financial advisor.











Objectives: This process starts with a deep understanding of a client’s specific objectives. When you spend the extra time to help them make better financial decisions, you solidify your relationships and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge. BlackRock has resources to guide you through these conversations and to assist you create a transparent, documented process. Lay the foundation with our objective-setting worksheets.


Risks: It’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions: How much risk should be taken, and what types of risk are tolerable in the portfolio. These two questions should be used dynamically when working with clients to regularly align their objectives with the amount of risk they are willing to take to achieve them. Discover how we see and analyze risk.


Costs: Portfolio costs come in two categories: fees (transaction costs and management fees) and taxes. Each of these eat into the returns a portfolio generates. Advisors that build a documented cost budget into their portfolio construction process can limit the impact of this erosion and ensure they are incurring costs only when justified. Learn how to capture the best value across investments.






 























View Transcript


You’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular check-ups. And you know that, to be healthier, you SHOULD do those things. But what if there was a regulation that said you MUST do those things. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding.
As ERISA fiduciaries, advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances. Because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives. When you look deeper, spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving, spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships, make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge.
*Research from Morningstar shows that investors who make intelligent financial planning decisions achieve better outcomes. They call it portfolio “gamma.” And, as a fiduciary, working to deeply understand client objectives … and regularly affirming those objectives ... may be the most important thing you do with clients. This is where you can add significant value … or gamma … to the client relationship.
Consider a process where you start by understanding the future purpose of the client’s money. Why are they investing? How much to they need? In what timeframe?
Then, assess different actions a client may need to take over time in order to achieve their desired goals. Do they need to work longer, spend less, or modify how they’re investing?
You and your client need to know their current cash flow to help determine how much … or how much more … they can save and invest. And, if retirement is the primary goal, understanding future cash flow can be more complicated.
Part of complying with DOL’s new regulation is having a documented process … that is transparent … to help address each client objective.
If your firm has a form for this, please use it. However, if not, BlackRock has resources to guide you through your process – including several worksheets that you can access here – to help you demonstrate your value proposition, add gamma to your client relationships AND meet your obligations as a fiduciary.










Understanding the DOL rule
The Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule, also known as the “conflict of interest” rule, extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets, including IRAs.

As a fiduciary under ERISA, it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client.
At its core, the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their client's best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest.

Many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the DOL rule. Regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact.
Read the full rule and exemptions here.
When will the DoL rule apply and what does that mean?
The fiduciary standard within the DOL fiduciary rule goes into effect on June 9, 2017. Full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until January 1, 2018.
The delay will allow the DOL to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard. Furthermore, the SEC has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts, which may impact the rule’s full implementation.


In the transition period between June 9 and January 1, advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts, which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors' best interest, receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions.
Between now and January 1, the DOL said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact.


What does it mean to be an ERISA fiduciary? Are there exceptions under the rule?
ERISA fiduciaries must comply with ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available. In other words, simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible. Intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program, absent a specific exemption.

Absent an exemption, prohibited transactions under ERISA include:

Dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account.
Acting on both sides of a transaction.
Receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets.



The fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions, and one is particularly important:

The Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption allows ERISA fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments (i.e., receive variable compensation) provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “Impartial Conduct Standard.”

To rely on the BIC and provide advice relating to IRA accounts, an advisor and firm must:

Act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation.
Not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services.
Provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers.
Not prohibit clients from engaging in class-action litigation to resolve claims. 
Enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more.

The disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until January 1, 2018.

FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

History[edit]
1988–1997[edit]
BlackRock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson to provide institutional clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective.[6] Fink, Kapito, Golub and Novick had worked together at First Boston, where Fink and his team were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States.[citation needed] During Fink's tenure, he had lost $100 million as head of First Boston. That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary practices. Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Pete Peterson of The Blackstone Group who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management. Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management.[citation needed] In exchange for a 50 percent stake in the bond business, initially Blackstone gave Fink and his team a $5 million credit line. Within months, the business had turned profitable, and by 1989 the group's assets had quadrupled to $2.7 billion. The percent of the stake owned by Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff.
By 1992, Blackstone had a stake equating to about 35% of the company, and Schwarzman and Fink were considering selling shares to the public.[7] The firm adopted the name BlackRock in 1992, and by the end of that year, BlackRock was managing $17 billion in assets. At the end of 1994, BlackRock was managing $53 billion.[8] In 1994, Blackstone Group's Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink had an internal dispute over methods of compensation[7] and over equity.[citation needed] Fink wanted to share equity with new hires, to lure talent from banks, unlike Schwarzman, who did not want to further lower Blackstone's stake.[7] They agreed to part ways, so the BlackRock partners (Sue Wagner) orchestrated a deal to sell part of the company.[citation needed] In June 1994 Blackstone sold a mortgage-securities unit with $23 billion in assets to PNC Bank Corp. for $240 million. The unit had traded mortgages and other fixed-income assets, and during the sales process the unit changed its name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock Financial Management.[7] Schwarzman remained with Blackstone, while Fink went on to become chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc.[7] In 1998, PNC’s equity, liquidity, and mutual fund activities were merged into BlackRock.[citation needed]
1999–2009[edit]




BlackRock headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.


BlackRock went public in 1999 at $14 a share[9] on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] By the end of 1999, BlackRock was managing $165 billion in assets.[8] BlackRock grew both organically and by acquisition. In August 2004, BlackRock made its first major acquisition, buying State Street Research & Management's holding company SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for $375 million in cash and stock. The acquisition raised BlackRock's assets under management from $314 billion to $325 billion.[10] The deal included the mutual-fund business State Street Research & Management in 2005.[11] BlackRock merged with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM) in 2006,[8][12] halving PNC's ownership and giving Merrill Lynch a 49.5% stake in the company.[citation needed] In October 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Capital Management.[13]
The U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help clean up after the financial meltdown of 2008. According to Vanity Fair, the financial establishment in Washington and on Wall Street believed BlackRock was the best choice for the job.[14] In 2009, BlackRock first became the number 1 asset manager worldwide.[11] In April 2009, BlackRock acquired R3 Capital Management, LLC and took control of the $1.5 billion fund.[15] On 12 June 2009, Barclays sold its Global Investors unit (BGI), which included its exchange traded fund business, iShares, to BlackRock for US$13.5 billion. Through the deal, Barclays attained a near-20% stake in BlackRock.[16] BGI was headquartered in San Francisco, with research and portfolio management teams in London, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and other cities.[citation needed]
2010–2017[edit]
In 2010, Ralph Schlosstein, the CEO of Evercore Partners and a BlackRock founder, called BlackRock "the most influential financial institution in the world."[17] On 1 April 2011, BlackRock replaced Genzyme on the S&P 500 index.[18]
In 2013, Fortune listed BlackRock on its annual list of the world's 50 Most Admired Companies.[11] In 2014, The Economist said that BlackRock's $4 trillion under management made it the "world's biggest asset manager," and it was larger than the world's largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with $3 trillion.[5] In May of the same year, BlackRock invested in Snapdeal.[19]
In December 2014 a BlackRock managing director in London was banned by the British Financial Conduct Authority for "not being a fit and proper" person, because he paid £43,000 to avoid prosecution for dodging train fares. BlackRock said: "Jonathan Burrows left BlackRock earlier this year. What he admitted to the FCA is totally contrary to our values and principles."[20]
At the end of 2014, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute reported that 65% of Blackrock's assets under management were made up of institutional investors.[21]
By June 30, 2015, BlackRock had US $4.721 trillion of assets under management.[citation needed] On August 26, 2015, BlackRock entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FutureAdvisor,[22] a digital wealth management provider with reported assets under management of $600 million.[23] Under the deal, FutureAdvisor would operate as a business within BlackRock Solutions (BRS).[22] BlackRock announced in November 2015 that they would wind down the BlackRock Global Ascent hedge fund after losses. The Global Ascent fund had been its only dedicated global macro fund, as BlackRock was "better known for its mutual funds and exchange traded funds." At the time, BlackRock managed $51 billion in hedge funds, with $20 billion of that in funds of hedge funds.[24]
In March 2017, the Financial Times announced that BlackRock, after a six-month review led by Mark Wiseman, had initiated a restructuring of its $8bn actively-managed fund business, resulting in the departure of seven portfolio managers and a $25m charge in Q2, replacing certain funds with quantitative investment strategies.[25] In May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in both CRH plc and Bank of Ireland.[26] By April 2017, iShares business accounted for $1.41tn, or 26 percent, of BlackRock's total assets under management, and 37 percent of BlackRock’s base fee income.[27] In April 2017, BlackRock backed the inclusion of mainland Chinese shares in MSCI’s global indice for the first time.[28]
Divisions[edit]
BlackRock Solutions[edit]
In 2000, BlackRock launched BlackRock Solutions, the risk management division of BlackRock, Inc. The division grew from the Aladdin System (which is the enterprise investment system), Green Package (which is the Risk Reporting Service) PAG (portfolio analytics) and AnSer (which is the interactive analytics). BlackRock Solutions (BRS) serves two roles within BlackRock. First, BlackRock Solutions is the in-house investment analytics and “process engineering” department for BlackRock which works with their portfolio management teams, risk and quantitative analysis, business operations and every other part of the firm that touches the investment process. Second, BlackRock Solutions (BRS) and the three primary divisions (which include risk management investment platform solutions, FMA, and client solutions) are services that offered to institutional clients. As of 2013, the platform had nearly 2,000 employees.[29]
BlackRock differentiates itself from other asset managers by claiming its risk management is not separate. Risk management is the foundation and cornerstone of the firm's entire platform.[29] Aladdin keeps track of 30,000 investment portfolios, including BlackRock's own along with those of competitors, banks, pension funds, and insurers. According to The Economist, the platform monitors almost 7 percent of the world’s $225 trillion of financial assets.[29]
BlackRock Solutions was retained by the U. S. Treasury Department in May 2009[17] to manage the toxic mortgage assets (i.e. to analyze, unwind, and price) that were owned by Bear Stearns, AIG, Inc., Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, and other financial firms that were affected in the 2008 financial crisis.[citation needed]

FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

History[edit]
1988–1997[edit]
BlackRock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson to provide institutional clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective.[6] Fink, Kapito, Golub and Novick had worked together at First Boston, where Fink and his team were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States.[citation needed] During Fink's tenure, he had lost $100 million as head of First Boston. That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary practices. Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Pete Peterson of The Blackstone Group who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management. Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management.[citation needed] In exchange for a 50 percent stake in the bond business, initially Blackstone gave Fink and his team a $5 million credit line. Within months, the business had turned profitable, and by 1989 the group's assets had quadrupled to $2.7 billion. The percent of the stake owned by Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff.
By 1992, Blackstone had a stake equating to about 35% of the company, and Schwarzman and Fink were considering selling shares to the public.[7] The firm adopted the name BlackRock in 1992, and by the end of that year, BlackRock was managing $17 billion in assets. At the end of 1994, BlackRock was managing $53 billion.[8] In 1994, Blackstone Group's Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink had an internal dispute over methods of compensation[7] and over equity.[citation needed] Fink wanted to share equity with new hires, to lure talent from banks, unlike Schwarzman, who did not want to further lower Blackstone's stake.[7] They agreed to part ways, so the BlackRock partners (Sue Wagner) orchestrated a deal to sell part of the company.[citation needed] In June 1994 Blackstone sold a mortgage-securities unit with $23 billion in assets to PNC Bank Corp. for $240 million. The unit had traded mortgages and other fixed-income assets, and during the sales process the unit changed its name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock Financial Management.[7] Schwarzman remained with Blackstone, while Fink went on to become chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc.[7] In 1998, PNC’s equity, liquidity, and mutual fund activities were merged into BlackRock.[citation needed]
1999–2009[edit]




BlackRock headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.


BlackRock went public in 1999 at $14 a share[9] on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] By the end of 1999, BlackRock was managing $165 billion in assets.[8] BlackRock grew both organically and by acquisition. In August 2004, BlackRock made its first major acquisition, buying State Street Research & Management's holding company SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for $375 million in cash and stock. The acquisition raised BlackRock's assets under management from $314 billion to $325 billion.[10] The deal included the mutual-fund business State Street Research & Management in 2005.[11] BlackRock merged with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM) in 2006,[8][12] halving PNC's ownership and giving Merrill Lynch a 49.5% stake in the company.[citation needed] In October 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Capital Management.[13]
The U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help clean up after the financial meltdown of 2008. According to Vanity Fair, the financial establishment in Washington and on Wall Street believed BlackRock was the best choice for the job.[14] In 2009, BlackRock first became the number 1 asset manager worldwide.[11] In April 2009, BlackRock acquired R3 Capital Management, LLC and took control of the $1.5 billion fund.[15] On 12 June 2009, Barclays sold its Global Investors unit (BGI), which included its exchange traded fund business, iShares, to BlackRock for US$13.5 billion. Through the deal, Barclays attained a near-20% stake in BlackRock.[16] BGI was headquartered in San Francisco, with research and portfolio management teams in London, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and other cities.[citation needed]
2010–2017[edit]
In 2010, Ralph Schlosstein, the CEO of Evercore Partners and a BlackRock founder, called BlackRock "the most influential financial institution in the world."[17] On 1 April 2011, BlackRock replaced Genzyme on the S&P 500 index.[18]
In 2013, Fortune listed BlackRock on its annual list of the world's 50 Most Admired Companies.[11] In 2014, The Economist said that BlackRock's $4 trillion under management made it the "world's biggest asset manager," and it was larger than the world's largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with $3 trillion.[5] In May of the same year, BlackRock invested in Snapdeal.[19]
In December 2014 a BlackRock managing director in London was banned by the British Financial Conduct Authority for "not being a fit and proper" person, because he paid £43,000 to avoid prosecution for dodging train fares. BlackRock said: "Jonathan Burrows left BlackRock earlier this year. What he admitted to the FCA is totally contrary to our values and principles."[20]
At the end of 2014, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute reported that 65% of Blackrock's assets under management were made up of institutional investors.[21]
By June 30, 2015, BlackRock had US $4.721 trillion of assets under management.[citation needed] On August 26, 2015, BlackRock entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FutureAdvisor,[22] a digital wealth management provider with reported assets under management of $600 million.[23] Under the deal, FutureAdvisor would operate as a business within BlackRock Solutions (BRS).[22] BlackRock announced in November 2015 that they would wind down the BlackRock Global Ascent hedge fund after losses. The Global Ascent fund had been its only dedicated global macro fund, as BlackRock was "better known for its mutual funds and exchange traded funds." At the time, BlackRock managed $51 billion in hedge funds, with $20 billion of that in funds of hedge funds.[24]
In March 2017, the Financial Times announced that BlackRock, after a six-month review led by Mark Wiseman, had initiated a restructuring of its $8bn actively-managed fund business, resulting in the departure of seven portfolio managers and a $25m charge in Q2, replacing certain funds with quantitative investment strategies.[25] In May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in both CRH plc and Bank of Ireland.[26] By April 2017, iShares business accounted for $1.41tn, or 26 percent, of BlackRock's total assets under management, and 37 percent of BlackRock’s base fee income.[27] In April 2017, BlackRock backed the inclusion of mainland Chinese shares in MSCI’s global indice for the first time.[28]
Divisions[edit]
BlackRock Solutions[edit]
In 2000, BlackRock launched BlackRock Solutions, the risk management division of BlackRock, Inc. The division grew from the Aladdin System (which is the enterprise investment system), Green Package (which is the Risk Reporting Service) PAG (portfolio analytics) and AnSer (which is the interactive analytics). BlackRock Solutions (BRS) serves two roles within BlackRock. First, BlackRock Solutions is the in-house investment analytics and “process engineering” department for BlackRock which works with their portfolio management teams, risk and quantitative analysis, business operations and every other part of the firm that touches the investment process. Second, BlackRock Solutions (BRS) and the three primary divisions (which include risk management investment platform solutions, FMA, and client solutions) are services that offered to institutional clients. As of 2013, the platform had nearly 2,000 employees.[29]
BlackRock differentiates itself from other asset managers by claiming its risk management is not separate. Risk management is the foundation and cornerstone of the firm's entire platform.[29] Aladdin keeps track of 30,000 investment portfolios, including BlackRock's own along with those of competitors, banks, pension funds, and insurers. According to The Economist, the platform monitors almost 7 percent of the world’s $225 trillion of financial assets.[29]
BlackRock Solutions was retained by the U. S. Treasury Department in May 2009[17] to manage the toxic mortgage assets (i.e. to analyze, unwind, and price) that were owned by Bear Stearns, AIG, Inc., Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, and other financial firms that were affected in the 2008 financial crisis.[citation needed]

History[edit]
1988–1997[edit]
BlackRock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson to provide institutional clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective.[6] Fink, Kapito, Golub and Novick had worked together at First Boston, where Fink and his team were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States.[citation needed] During Fink's tenure, he had lost $100 million as head of First Boston. That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary practices. Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Pete Peterson of The Blackstone Group who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management. Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management.[citation needed] In exchange for a 50 percent stake in the bond business, initially Blackstone gave Fink and his team a $5 million credit line. Within months, the business had turned profitable, and by 1989 the group's assets had quadrupled to $2.7 billion. The percent of the stake owned by Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff.
By 1992, Blackstone had a stake equating to about 35% of the company, and Schwarzman and Fink were considering selling shares to the public.[7] The firm adopted the name BlackRock in 1992, and by the end of that year, BlackRock was managing $17 billion in assets. At the end of 1994, BlackRock was managing $53 billion.[8] In 1994, Blackstone Group's Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink had an internal dispute over methods of compensation[7] and over equity.[citation needed] Fink wanted to share equity with new hires, to lure talent from banks, unlike Schwarzman, who did not want to further lower Blackstone's stake.[7] They agreed to part ways, so the BlackRock partners (Sue Wagner) orchestrated a deal to sell part of the company.[citation needed] In June 1994 Blackstone sold a mortgage-securities unit with $23 billion in assets to PNC Bank Corp. for $240 million. The unit had traded mortgages and other fixed-income assets, and during the sales process the unit changed its name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock Financial Management.[7] Schwarzman remained with Blackstone, while Fink went on to become chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc.[7] In 1998, PNC’s equity, liquidity, and mutual fund activities were merged into BlackRock.[citation needed]
1999–2009[edit]




BlackRock headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.


BlackRock went public in 1999 at $14 a share[9] on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] By the end of 1999, BlackRock was managing $165 billion in assets.[8] BlackRock grew both organically and by acquisition. In August 2004, BlackRock made its first major acquisition, buying State Street Research & Management's holding company SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for $375 million in cash and stock. The acquisition raised BlackRock's assets under management from $314 billion to $325 billion.[10] The deal included the mutual-fund business State Street Research & Management in 2005.[11] BlackRock merged with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM) in 2006,[8][12] halving PNC's ownership and giving Merrill Lynch a 49.5% stake in the company.[citation needed] In October 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Capital Management.[13]
The U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help clean up after the financial meltdown of 2008. According to Vanity Fair, the financial establishment in Washington and on Wall Street believed BlackRock was the best choice for the job.[14] In 2009, BlackRock first became the number 1 asset manager worldwide.[11] In April 2009, BlackRock acquired R3 Capital Management, LLC and took control of the $1.5 billion fund.[15] On 12 June 2009, Barclays sold its Global Investors unit (BGI), which included its exchange traded fund business, iShares, to BlackRock for US$13.5 billion. Through the deal, Barclays attained a near-20% stake in BlackRock.[16] BGI was headquartered in San Francisco, with research and portfolio management teams in London, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and other cities.[citation needed]
2010–2017[edit]
In 2010, Ralph Schlosstein, the CEO of Evercore Partners and a BlackRock founder, called BlackRock "the most influential financial institution in the world."[17] On 1 April 2011, BlackRock replaced Genzyme on the S&P 500 index.[18]
In 2013, Fortune listed BlackRock on its annual list of the world's 50 Most Admired Companies.[11] In 2014, The Economist said that BlackRock's $4 trillion under management made it the "world's biggest asset manager," and it was larger than the world's largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with $3 trillion.[5] In May of the same year, BlackRock invested in Snapdeal.[19]
In December 2014 a BlackRock managing director in London was banned by the British Financial Conduct Authority for "not being a fit and proper" person, because he paid £43,000 to avoid prosecution for dodging train fares. BlackRock said: "Jonathan Burrows left BlackRock earlier this year. What he admitted to the FCA is totally contrary to our values and principles."[20]
At the end of 2014, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute reported that 65% of Blackrock's assets under management were made up of institutional investors.[21]
By June 30, 2015, BlackRock had US $4.721 trillion of assets under management.[citation needed] On August 26, 2015, BlackRock entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FutureAdvisor,[22] a digital wealth management provider with reported assets under management of $600 million.[23] Under the deal, FutureAdvisor would operate as a business within BlackRock Solutions (BRS).[22] BlackRock announced in November 2015 that they would wind down the BlackRock Global Ascent hedge fund after losses. The Global Ascent fund had been its only dedicated global macro fund, as BlackRock was "better known for its mutual funds and exchange traded funds." At the time, BlackRock managed $51 billion in hedge funds, with $20 billion of that in funds of hedge funds.[24]
In March 2017, the Financial Times announced that BlackRock, after a six-month review led by Mark Wiseman, had initiated a restructuring of its $8bn actively-managed fund business, resulting in the departure of seven portfolio managers and a $25m charge in Q2, replacing certain funds with quantitative investment strategies.[25] In May 2017, BlackRock increased its stake in both CRH plc and Bank of Ireland.[26] By April 2017, iShares business accounted for $1.41tn, or 26 percent, of BlackRock's total assets under management, and 37 percent of BlackRock’s base fee income.[27] In April 2017, BlackRock backed the inclusion of mainland Chinese shares in MSCI’s global indice for the first time.[28]
Divisions[edit]
BlackRock Solutions[edit]
In 2000, BlackRock launched BlackRock Solutions, the risk management division of BlackRock, Inc. The division grew from the Aladdin System (which is the enterprise investment system), Green Package (which is the Risk Reporting Service) PAG (portfolio analytics) and AnSer (which is the interactive analytics). BlackRock Solutions (BRS) serves two roles within BlackRock. First, BlackRock Solutions is the in-house investment analytics and “process engineering” department for BlackRock which works with their portfolio management teams, risk and quantitative analysis, business operations and every other part of the firm that touches the investment process. Second, BlackRock Solutions (BRS) and the three primary divisions (which include risk management investment platform solutions, FMA, and client solutions) are services that offered to institutional clients. As of 2013, the platform had nearly 2,000 employees.[29]
BlackRock differentiates itself from other asset managers by claiming its risk management is not separate. Risk management is the foundation and cornerstone of the firm's entire platform.[29] Aladdin keeps track of 30,000 investment portfolios, including BlackRock's own along with those of competitors, banks, pension funds, and insurers. According to The Economist, the platform monitors almost 7 percent of the world’s $225 trillion of financial assets.[29]
BlackRock Solutions was retained by the U. S. Treasury Department in May 2009[17] to manage the toxic mortgage assets (i.e. to analyze, unwind, and price) that were owned by Bear Stearns, AIG, Inc., Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, and other financial firms that were affected in the 2008 financial crisis.[citation needed]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
