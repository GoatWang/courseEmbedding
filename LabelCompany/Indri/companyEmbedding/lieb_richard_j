Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Haas, Richard J, MD2304 John Rolfe PkwyHenrico, VA 23233(804) 741-4404Physicians & Surgeons, PediatricsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Haas, Richard J, MD4786 Finlay StHenrico, VA 23231(804) 226-4100Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Haas Richard J MD10571 Telegraph Rd Ste 110Glen Allen, VA 23059(804) 266-9616Physicians & Surgeons, PediatricsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Knapp Richard J & Associates2800 Patterson AveRichmond, VA 23221(804) 377-8848Estate Planning AttorneysAttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Placide Rick J MD1115 Boulders Parkway, Suite 100Richmond, VA 23225(804) 320-1339Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Klaas, J Richard, MD7521 Right Flank RdMechanicsville, VA 23116(804) 559-0447Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Richard J Gray DR1149 Jefferson Green CirMidlothian, VA 23113(804) 378-9152Physicians & SurgeonsBusinesses in related categories to DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED8. Allergy, Asthma & Sleep Center of Central Virginia1346 Alverser PlzMidlothian, VA 23113(804) 601-0949Physicians & Surgeons, Sleep DisordersWebsiteSee Our ServicesDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: We provide evaluation and management of the following and more: Asthma Allergic Rhinitis Allergic Skin Diseases like Eczema, Hives and other rashes Food Allergies…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED9. Godin Michael S MDBBB Rating: A+410 Libbie AveRichmond, VA 23226(804) 381-5777Physicians & Surgeons, Cosmetic SurgeryWebsiteSee Our ServicesDirectionsVideoServicesMore InfoFrom Business: Michael Godin, MD of Richmond, Virginia is a double Board Certified specialist in cosmetic surgery of the face only.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
