Why Cascade Angels? | Cascade Angels - Elevating Oregon

Creating opportunities for investors and businesses in Oregon to drive economic growth and fuel prosperity.









Why Cascade Angels?






The time for Central Oregon is now.
A little over 30 years ago, the population of Bend, Central Oregon’s largest city, was just 20,000.
Fast forward to today and the Bend Metro area is the fastest growing city of its size in America, and Central Oregon boasts over 200,000 residents.
With Bend receiving national recognition for its entrepreneurial climate, it raises the profile and access to investment for all of Central Oregon’s cities such as La Pine, Madras, Prineville, Redmond, Sisters, and more
Cascade Angels (2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) are about fueling prosperity. But it’s more than successful funds — Cascade Angels intends to build an economic engine in Oregon for investors with a connection to Central Oregon, contribute to a sustainable economy that creates jobs, and keep Central Oregon on the map. For more information, contact us.

Does money buy happiness? No, people it does not. But it can get your startup another developer or fund a production run of your product, and sometimes, that’s just what you need. And if you happen to be looking for investment, then consider applying for Cascade Angels’ second funding round of the year.
From Cascade Angels:
Entrepreneurs seeking investment capital have an opportunity to present their early stage businesses for growth to Cascade Angels. Cascade Angels Fund 2017, LLC (“Cascade Angels Fund 2017” or the “Fund”) has opened up its second application period, which runs from April 4 to May 1, 2017. Entrepreneurs interested in applying can do so via Gust.com.
The Fund anticipates additional application rounds in the coming months and investing in 4-7 companies in 2017. Typical investments are made in early stage, Oregon-based companies from any industry. Investments are anticipated to range from $100,000 to $250,000.
Cascade Angels Fund is now in its fourth year. The Fund’s mission is to create regional opportunities for investors and businesses to drive economic growth and fuel prosperity. The Fund’s profile on Gust.com includes additional information regarding its purpose, mission and goals. Since 2014, Cascade Angels Fund has invested nearly $2M in 13 companies, all of which are still in operation and cumulatively employ over 100 people, according to the news release.
“We’ve already had one application period this year and were impressed with the quality of the companies coming through,” says Julie Harrelson, CEO of Harrelson Group Inc., Fund Manager for Cascade Angels. “As always, our focus is to generate returns for investors, while also positively impacting job creation and economic development in our region.”
An entrepreneur, investor and leader in Oregon’s startup community, Julie co-founded Cascade Angels Fund in Bend in 2013. She was recently named “Woman of the Year” by the Bend Chamber for the difference she has made in the business community.
Finally, if you actually are looking for happiness — with or without funds — we humbly offer this. (At some point, we will tire of dog gifs. But not for awhile).

Hello Startups, Can You Hear Me? Cascade Angels is Looking for Investment Opportunities

Goodness, I’ve had that Adele song stuck my head for weeks. And now I’ve passed the ear worm onto you. Back to business: Cascade Angels, the Bend-based angel fund, has opened up its application process to Oregon entrepreneurs looking for funding.
The fund anticipates investing in up to six companies this year. The fund usually invests from $50,000 to $250,000 in Oregon-based launch stage companies (you have a product and revenue) from any industry. So if you’re a startup looking for capital, you should apply. The deadline is Feb. 17.
“We hope to provide patient capital to entrepreneurs with Oregon-based companies, generate returns and create jobs,” says Julie Harrelson, CEO, Harrelson Group, which manages the fund.
Cascade Angels has invested close to $1 million in Oregon since 2014. The 2016 Fund is the organization’s third. Bend companies that have received investments include Amplion, Droplr, Manzama, LeadMethod and Odysys. The Fund has also invested in Poached Jobs, Lumen, NemaMetrix and ScratchIt.
The first Cascade Angels fund raised $460,000. The Cascade Angels Fund 2015, LLC grew to $725,000. Cascade Angels Fund 2016, LLC plans to raise a minimum of $500,000 by March 31, 2016, according to the organization’s profile on gust.com.
So ….. Hello from the funding sideeeeeeee/it doesn’t hurt to just applyyyyyyyyy/Cascade Angels has money to invest in our state/So give it a try and it just might great ….

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
