      Testimonials    




 “David was  great to work with - he immediately researched the problem, found the missing paperwork and was able to take our account out of suspense promptly. He did his job diligently and quickly, finding the problem and resolving it. Thank you!” 
 Mary Longnecker 
 Dardenne Prairie, Missouri  

 “In November 1984, my father received his first royalty check for our well. It is still producing today and the income my sister and I continue to receive from that well has made many things possible in our lives, like more education and a new home and purchasing more farmland. It has been such a blessing to us.” 
 Jean Nygaard 
 Wildrose, North Dakota  

 “We have been pleased with the way Continental Resources has done business with us over the years. Our questions have always been answered, and they have been very good stewards of our land. The income from this well has paid for the college educations for our children, and it has made many extras in our life possible.” 
 Marcene Thvedt 
 Bismarck, North Dakota  

 







Our Process 





	Continental’s process with our royalty, mineral and working interest partners can be summed up into five basic stages:

		Evaluation

		Acquisition

		Drilling Operations

		Completion

		Continued Operation/Maintenance

	Throughout our process you may interact with many different people, including Continental employees, subcontractors, assigns and legal representatives. We want to help you understand our process, how we will work together, and who you will be working with in each stage.

      About Our Operations    




 
	Our operations are focused on the Red River Units, Anadarko Woodford and Bakken field plays. Our operating strategy is to create shareholder value through organic growth and applying advanced technology to harvest oil and natural gas resources.

	Although we evaluate strategic acquisitions periodically, our technical staff has internally generated substantially all of the opportunities for the investment of our capital.

 ECO-Pad® 
  
  The ECO-Pad drilling technique allows us to harvest more of a reservoir’s resources while reducing costs and environmental impact.   

 Horizontal Drilling 
  
  
	Horizontal drilling gives us access to resource plays that were previously not economic to produce. With this technology, we are unlocking oil and natural gas reservoirs throughout the U.S., reducing our nation’s dependence on foreign energy imports.   

 Well Stimulation 
  
  Well stimulation is an oil and gas term for using high pressure water and sand to crack a rock formation deep underground.

Continental Resources Has Upside Of At Least 27% - Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CLR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Continental Resources Has Upside Of At Least 27%Nov.15.13 | About: Continental Resources, (CLR) Detroit Bear Deep Value, special situations, long-term horizon, valueDetroit Bear on TwitterSecular growth is hard to find as the US GDP continues to chug along, growing at least 3%. However, there is one place with an abundance of growth, and that is the US domestic energy production sector. The largest leaseholder in the Bakken, Continental Resources, looks cheap, and I believe shares have 27% as a stand-alone company, and 80% upside in the event of an acquisition.
A Quick Snapshot of Continental
Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) is exposed to the hottest, still up-and-coming area in the US economy, though the company has been around for several decades, beginning as a wildcat driller in Oklahoma. The company acquired its first 300,000 acres in the Bakken in 2003, and in just a decade, it became the largest single leaseholder in the region with over 1 million net developable acres in burgeoning region.

Image Source: CLR 10-K
Production is Growing Rapidly
New product continues to gush out of the Continental's wells. Production during the third quarter rose a whopping 38% year-over-year to 13.1 million Boe, or 141,900 Boe per day. More importantly, 71% of this product was oil, which carries a much more favorable profitability profile than natural gas.
Year-to-date, the company has produced 36.3 million Boe, thus I expect full-year production to total nearly 50 million Boe in 2013. Going forward, Continental Resources anticipates production growth of 26%-32% in 2014, with 70% of the mix coming in the form of crude oil. This is only year 2 of the company's five-year plan to triple production and proved reserves. In other words, Continental Resources' growth phase still has plenty of room to run.


Image Source: CLR
Upon completion of its five-year plan, the firm should triple its proven reserves to 1,524 MBoe while its production jumps to 108 MBoe per day. These figures would seem overly optimistic; however, I think Continental's lease profile favors long-term production growth. Because the firm has a strong balance sheet, it will be able to increase production on the 873,782 net acres of undeveloped acreage that is set to expire within the next three years if production does not begin.
Total debt/EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and exploration costs) stands slightly below the industry average of 2, so I think Continental will be able to easily raise more capital if it is necessary to capitalize on the undeveloped acreage.
Production Costs are Under Control

Image Source: CLR Q3 2013 Investor Presentation
In oil and most resource production, depreciation and amortization are huge components of the GAAP accounting costs, so it is more useful to look at cash costs. In this respect, Continental Resources is doing an incredible job of executing. Cash costs per Boe are $19.11 year-to-date, resulting in a cash margin of 74%. Peers like Whiting Petroleum and Hess have cash costs per Boe in the low-$20 range, so I consider Continental one of the premier operators in the region.
Even more impressive, Continental's cash costs have held steady outside of its interest expense. In other words, the actual cost of production without financing costs has remained flat to mostly flat. With production costs remaining low, all incremental production gains should lead to terrific cash flow generation, which Continental can plow back into more production.
Oil Price Risk is Possible, but Not Crippling

Continental's low production costs also provide a buffer against a decline in oil prices. Even when realized oil prices were just $54.44 per Bbl in 2009, Continental generated a cash margin of 69%. Though production costs are slightly higher today, the firm would still generate a cash margin of 65% in the event that oil prices reverted to 2009 levels-though I don't see oil prices falling that low unless there is another global financial crisis.
Whether the resource is coal, oil, or gold, the largest risk to commodity producers are exogenous price moves. With such robust margins, Continental mitigates much of the commodity price risk, thus making it a name I'm comfortable holding in any economic environment.
A Supermajor Will Want Continental Resources
It's no secret that the oil supermajors like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), BP (NYSE:BP), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were late to the Bakken party. Exxon in particular is having a difficult time replenishing proven reserves. The cohort in general has a bleak outlook for future production growth.
Continental already has strong proved reserves with a high likelihood that those reserves will increase over the next several years. Continental Resources would therefore be a wonderful strategic fit for Exxon, and the company is fully capable of making an offer. Exxon has already spent $25 billion on capital investment in FY2013, and it has repurchased $12.6 billion worth of stock.
The market currently assigns Continental Resources an enterprise value of $25 billion. Year-to-date, Continental has generated $2.1 billion in EBITDAX, and I believe it is capable of achieving $2.8 billion in EBITDAX for FY2013, generating an EV/EBITDAX multiple of 9. The table below displays the range of takeover values for Continental based on different scenarios.

As we can clearly see, the range of takeover premiums could be pretty large depending on multiples and actual EBITDAX growth. I think FY2014 would be prime for a takeover while interest rates remain low and the future potential for oil price appreciation remains moderate.
Realistically, the median of my estimates would occur with 30% EBITDAX growth (possible considering management anticipates production growth of 26-32%) valuing the company at 12x EBITDAX. Less net debt of $4.3 billion, I come up with a market capitalization of $39.4 billion, yielding appreciation potential of 80% within the next 12-15 months assuming no dilution.
While it is difficult to find a comparable deal, Buffett and 3G Capital paid 14x trailing EBITDA to acquire the mature Heinz for $28 billion. A high-growth, slam-dunk investment for a supermajor should easily be able to achieve a valuation of 12x EV/EBITDAX, in my opinion.
What are the Risks to Continental Resources?
The primary risk to Continental Resources is a decline in oil prices. Not only would it hurt profitability, but it would also damage the premium an acquirer is willing to pay, since the estimated return on investment would decline considerably.
Another risk to the firm is that acreage yields lower than expected reserves. Fellow contributor Richard Zeits has noted that Continental has been conservative in its estimates, and new fracking technology makes it likely that, if anything, the firm will find greater reserves than it anticipates. Still, oil and gas projects do fail from time-to-time, so I do not believe investors should feel better-than-expected proved reserves are a slam-dunk.
An understated, but looming risk, involves the ability to transport shale out of the Bakken region. Refiners like Phillips 66 demanded and received discounts on shale product because oil and gas companies were extracting resources from the ground at a faster rate than the transportation infrastructure could handle.
However, the moving product from the Bakken will be extremely profitable, and companies like Enbridge have invested heavily in the surrounding pipeline infrastructure. Michael Fitzsimmons wrote extensively about the Bakken development, and since his article, I have noticed that the amount of advantaged (discounted) crude that refiners were receiving has not grown significantly. I am not sure how the Keystone pipeline development will play out, but if the government ever allows Phase 4 to be developed, then I believe a great deal of transportation risk disappears.

Continental Resources will Thrive even if it isn't Acquired
Although I believe the odds of an acquisition are high given the favorable financing environment that could soon be ending as well as the lack of proved reserve growth at the oil supermajors, I think shareholders will be pleased with Continental's performance even if it isn't acquired.
The company remains a low cost operator, has an enviable lease position, and has shown the ability to grow EBITDAX at a robust pace (FY12 EBITDAX was $2.1 billion; FY09 EBITDAX was $450 million).
From a valuation perspective, shares are trading at just 16x 2014 earnings compared to expected earnings per share expansion of 30%. Shares of Exxon currently sell for 12x 2014 earnings even though earnings per share growth is only expected to be 6-7%. Whiting Petroleum expects earnings to grow 2%, and shares trade at 15x 2014 earning. Continental is currently receiving only a slight premium even as its earnings per share growth and long-term prospects look far superior going forward.
In the event that Continental Resources is not acquired, my 2014 price target is $146 based on 20x FY2014 earnings, implying 27% upside from current levels. In a market that mostly looks fairly valued, I think 27% share price appreciation is fantastic. Further, I expect earnings per share to grow at least 15% for the next five years, which should lead to wonderful share appreciation. The market seems to have materially mispriced this wonderful growth story.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Current operations[edit]
The company has large holdings in the Bakken formation tight oil area of North Dakota and Montana, the Niobara formation, the Anadarko Woodford Play of Oklahoma, and the Red River Units Play of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, total production was 225 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,380,000 GJ) per day, of which 65% was oil and 35% was natural gas. [1]
History[edit]
In 1967, Harold Hamm founded Shelly Dean Oil Co., Continental’s predecessor. [3]
In 1990, the company was renamed Continental Resources. [4]
In 1995, Continental discovered what was later described as the Cedar Hills Field in North Dakota – the 7th largest onshore field in the lower 48 United States ranked by liquid proved reserves – and is the first to develop it exclusively through precision horizontal drilling.[5]
In 2003, Continental drilled its first wells in the Bakken formation.[6]
In 2004, Continental completed the Robert Heuer 1-17R in Divide County, the 1st commercially successful well in the North Dakota Bakken to be both horizontally drilled and hydraulic fracture stimulated.[7]
In 2007, the company became a public company via an initial public offering in which Harold Hamm sold approximately $300 million worth of his shares. [8]
In 2008, Continental was the first to complete a horizontal well in the Three Forks zone.[9]
In 2010, Continental introduced the ECO-Pad® drilling technique, whereby the company is able to drill 4 wells from 1 pad. This reduces the cost of drilling for oil and increase production output. [10]
In 2012, the company moved its headquarters to Oklahoma City.[11]
In 2012, CEO Harold Hamm was named one of TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[12]

In 2012, the company moved its headquarters to Oklahoma City.[11]
In 2012, CEO Harold Hamm was named one of TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[12]

Current operations[edit]
The company has large holdings in the Bakken formation tight oil area of North Dakota and Montana, the Niobara formation, the Anadarko Woodford Play of Oklahoma, and the Red River Units Play of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, total production was 225 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,380,000 GJ) per day, of which 65% was oil and 35% was natural gas. [1]
History[edit]
In 1967, Harold Hamm founded Shelly Dean Oil Co., Continental’s predecessor. [3]
In 1990, the company was renamed Continental Resources. [4]
In 1995, Continental discovered what was later described as the Cedar Hills Field in North Dakota – the 7th largest onshore field in the lower 48 United States ranked by liquid proved reserves – and is the first to develop it exclusively through precision horizontal drilling.[5]
In 2003, Continental drilled its first wells in the Bakken formation.[6]
In 2004, Continental completed the Robert Heuer 1-17R in Divide County, the 1st commercially successful well in the North Dakota Bakken to be both horizontally drilled and hydraulic fracture stimulated.[7]
In 2007, the company became a public company via an initial public offering in which Harold Hamm sold approximately $300 million worth of his shares. [8]
In 2008, Continental was the first to complete a horizontal well in the Three Forks zone.[9]
In 2010, Continental introduced the ECO-Pad® drilling technique, whereby the company is able to drill 4 wells from 1 pad. This reduces the cost of drilling for oil and increase production output. [10]
In 2012, the company moved its headquarters to Oklahoma City.[11]
In 2012, CEO Harold Hamm was named one of TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[12]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
