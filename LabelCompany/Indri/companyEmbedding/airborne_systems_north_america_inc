When Your Commute Is 25,000 feet...SOLR™ Airborne Systems designs and manufactures a line of oxygen products for the most extreme HAHO and HALO missions, known as SOLR™.



 
jTrax Navaid™Navigation From Above The jTrax Navaid is a device worn on a jumper’s harness to aid in navigation to the intended Impact Point (IP). The Navaid improves safety and increases effectiveness of military jumpers by providing accurate navigation for even the most demanding missions.



 
What are combo drops? Combo drops are anytime a GPADS is used in conjunction with jumpers. The GPADS can either fly itself to the pre-programmed coordinates, or a jumper can manually steer it to the destination. This proves extremely helpful in covert missions, minimizing the amount of gear the jumper must carry.



 
Hi-5®OUR NEWEST CANOPY Airborne Systems has designed a revolutionary ram air parachute like no other.  Visit the Hi-5® page and watch the video to learn how we are changing the future of parachutes.



 
Intruder System (RA-1)Ram-Air Tactical Parachute Systems Superior glide performance for maximum offset and performance characteristics to minimize the potential for injury on landing.



 
The MicroFly II®Airborne Systems newest GPADS is available today. Improve military mission capabilities without compromising safety or increasing training requirements.

Intruder System (RA-1)

Suited for a novice in need of docile performance or an experienced pilot who demands performance extremes for mission success.

Intended for use during HALO or HAHO missions, the Intruder 360 main canopy incorporates a design developed by Airborne Systems that improves velocity and glide.
Pressurized stabilizers increase glide performance and improve performance in deep brakes by forcing the canopy to track forward without lateral slip. The pressurized stabilizers also render the canopy completely silent.

SOLR™ Oxygen Mask























SOLR™ Oxygen Mask
Overview
SpecificationsSpec SheetsRelated Products 

Overview



The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask builds on the reliability and strong features of its predecessor, the Airborne Systems’ PHAOS Oxygen Mask, the current reference for the Parachutist Oxygen Masks used by Military Units worldwide.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask is compatible with the new SOLR™ and legacy PHAOS Bailout Bottles. It is also compatible with the PHANTOM Bailout Bottle.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask provides the same performance and time proven reliability as the PHAOS Oxygen Mask, with the added benefit of new features developed based on input received from experiences collected over the years from the Military Free Fall community.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask features a new non-dilution oxygen demand regulator which delivers 100% oxygen during inhalation, both during pre-breathing and during the actual jump and descent under canopy.  This ensures that the jumper is never breathing a mix of gas and mitigates the risk of hypoxia, drastically increasing the safety of operation.  This breakthrough innovation is made possible thanks to the very high service pressure of Airborne Systems’ latest Bailout Bottles, allowing them to contain significantly more oxygen than traditional Bailout Bottles.
Key Features:

Lightweight
On demand regulator, no dilution (100% O2)
Modular (dilution module optional)
Compatible with SOLR / PHAOS / PHANTOM Bailout Bottles
5 sizes
Compatible with all parachutist helmets on the market
Easy maintenance

Intruder System (RA-1)

Suited for a novice in need of docile performance or an experienced pilot who demands performance extremes for mission success.

Intended for use during HALO or HAHO missions, the Intruder 360 main canopy incorporates a design developed by Airborne Systems that improves velocity and glide.
Pressurized stabilizers increase glide performance and improve performance in deep brakes by forcing the canopy to track forward without lateral slip. The pressurized stabilizers also render the canopy completely silent.

When Your Commute Is 25,000 feet...SOLR™ Airborne Systems designs and manufactures a line of oxygen products for the most extreme HAHO and HALO missions, known as SOLR™.



 
jTrax Navaid™Navigation From Above The jTrax Navaid is a device worn on a jumper’s harness to aid in navigation to the intended Impact Point (IP). The Navaid improves safety and increases effectiveness of military jumpers by providing accurate navigation for even the most demanding missions.



 
What are combo drops? Combo drops are anytime a GPADS is used in conjunction with jumpers. The GPADS can either fly itself to the pre-programmed coordinates, or a jumper can manually steer it to the destination. This proves extremely helpful in covert missions, minimizing the amount of gear the jumper must carry.



 
Hi-5®OUR NEWEST CANOPY Airborne Systems has designed a revolutionary ram air parachute like no other.  Visit the Hi-5® page and watch the video to learn how we are changing the future of parachutes.



 
Intruder System (RA-1)Ram-Air Tactical Parachute Systems Superior glide performance for maximum offset and performance characteristics to minimize the potential for injury on landing.



 
The MicroFly II®Airborne Systems newest GPADS is available today. Improve military mission capabilities without compromising safety or increasing training requirements.

Intruder System (RA-1)

Suited for a novice in need of docile performance or an experienced pilot who demands performance extremes for mission success.

Intended for use during HALO or HAHO missions, the Intruder 360 main canopy incorporates a design developed by Airborne Systems that improves velocity and glide.
Pressurized stabilizers increase glide performance and improve performance in deep brakes by forcing the canopy to track forward without lateral slip. The pressurized stabilizers also render the canopy completely silent.

Hi-5®

The Hi-5® is truly one of a kind, not only does it have exceptional ram air glide performance, but it also has the ability to lose altitude quickly similar to a troop parachute. In order to achieve this, our engineers designed our patent pending Glide Modulation System.

A higher All Up Weight (AUW) of 485lbs on both the main and reserve
A greater glide ratio of 5:1
