Product Description
David Hall identifies 10 seminal ways that Calvin's thought transformed the culture of the West, complete with a nontechnical biography of Calvin and tributes by other leaders. The Legacy of John Calvin is brief enough for popular audiences and analytical enough to provide much information in a short space.

S. Sing – January 10, 2015

I really enjoy this Cellerciser. I find my whole family loves to bounce on it, and after doing some reading about the health benefits, I’m sold. It’s fun, it’s good for you, and it came immediately. It’s very easy to assemble, or to fold and put away.









Hester – January 17, 2015

I bought a Cellerciser and am quite happy with it. I have weak knees and my knees hurt when I walk even a short distance. This rebounder is easy on the knees and works well with aerobic rebounding programs. Most people that know about rebounders consider the Cellerciser to be the Lexus of rebounders. When you consider the cost of a decent treadmill or elliptical, a quality rebounder such as the Cellerciser is worth the extra money spent.









Lilac – January 24, 2015

I’m a senior citizen who has owned my Cellerciser for about eights months. I carefully worked my way up to Cellercising for 35 minutes. In no time, I saw improvement with a knee problem that caused me to limp whenever I sat for more than 15 minutes. With the Cellerciser I am able to exercise daily. I did a lot of research before purchasing it, and decided on the Cellerciser because of the soft bounce, the fact that it folds up, and the balance bar. In the 70s I owned a cheap rebounder that probably would have caused injury if I had used it a lot. However, it had such a hard bounce that I soon got rid of it. The Cellerciser was not inexpensive, but worth every penny. I love it!









Maxava – February 2, 2015

I recently received my Cellerciser Half-Fold Rebounder and was pleased that it was set up and ready to use within minutes of pulling it out of the box. I’m enjoying using it every day and have decided to leave it set up permanently. I do like that it is easily portable so I can take it with us whenever we do go a trip. Very happy with my purchase.









G. Birkner – February 7, 2015

This is an awesome product, well made, affordable and easy to use whether you are an accomplished athlete or can only walk with the aid of a cane. Cheaper rebounders can injure your body because of the jarring effect on your knees and back due to poor springs and allowing your feet to tip inward or pronate. Not on the Cellerciser, though. It is the best rebounder on the market in my opinion. I purchased mine about 19 months ago and have used it regularly every since following David Hall’s Cellercise program. My overall health and well being are MUCH better now. Every home should have one of these.









Latasha L. – February 13, 2015

I have a lot of exercise equipment. This is by far the greatest piece I own. Easy to set up and travel with. Love that even when I have lower leg injuries that don’t allow for outdoor running I can always get a great workout on my Cellerciser.









jason – December 22, 2016

What is the weight capacity?  and what warranty comes with the product.  The web sight did not give this information.









Stryde – January 5, 2017

Hi Jason – It’s a five-year warranty that you can learn about on the features page: https://cellercise.com/features/ The Cellerciser is warranted to support up to 300 lbs, but we’ve had customers at 400 lbs use it successfully.

BOOK 1 OF THE CONTINUUM (Maiden voyage of the Armageddon) The Armageddon has the huge-ship, sweeping panorama, feeling of Battlestar Galactica, as well as the tense bridge scenes which became the hallmark of Star Trek.  However, unlike either of those works.  The Armageddon gives us as much a view of the aliens as it does the humans.  Indeed, you just might come away from this book liking the Hykonian Admiral, Algol.  If so, it's not an accident - there's no rule that only humans can be heroes.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
