November 19, 2004 07:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



				COLUMBIA, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 19, 2004--Chairman of the Board Robert R. Horger announced today that Robert R. Hill, Jr. has been named president and chief executive officer for SCBT Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: SCBT), and South Carolina Bank and Trust, N.A. in a unanimous board decision.  "Our Board has had the opportunity to observe the performance of Robert Hill for many years. We have complete confidence in the ability of Robert to lead SCBT Financial to continued success," said Horger. "Robert has a qualified and capable executive management team that is focused on the goal of building a statewide presence and raising SCBT to the forefront of community-oriented, independent banks in South Carolina. There is certainly an air of excitement within our company as to the potential for SCBT under the leadership of Robert and our management group." 

 Prior to joining SCBT's executive management team, Hill was the founding president and CEO of South Carolina Bank and Trust of the Piedmont, N.A. He was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company's lead bank in 1998, and became president and COO in 2000.  "Over the past 20 years, out of state banks have bought many of the local South Carolina banks. Our goal is to build this franchise into a statewide South Carolina bank where decisions can still be made locally by people you know," said Hill. "Our formula for success for the past 70 years has been to focus on our customers and our employees, with the shareholder being the beneficiary. This philosophy has served our company well, and we will continue this legacy as we enter the next era."  A native of Columbia, South Carolina, Hill earned his undergraduate degree at the Citadel and a master's degree in business administration from the University of South Carolina. He and his wife Carol currently reside in Columbia with their two children.  Throughout his career, Hill has been recognized for his successes. Earlier this year, he was named one of the State Newspaper's 20 Under 40 award recipients and was named Distinguished Young Alumnus by the University of South Carolina's Moore School of Business. In 2000, he was named South Carolina's Outstanding Young Banker of the Year, and in 1996, was honored by the Charlotte Business Journal as a Newsmaker of the Year.  An active member of the community, Hill has held leadership positions in many different organizations including S.C. Bankers Association, S.C. Bankers School, Central Carolina Community Foundation, Orangeburg Calhoun County Community Foundation, S.C. Museum Foundation, Columbia Museum of Art, and the Greater Columbia Chamber of Commerce.  SCBT Financial Corporation is a multi-bank holding company whose principal subsidiaries are South Carolina Bank and Trust, N.A. and South Carolina Bank and Trust of the Piedmont, N.A. The Mortgage Banc, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of South Carolina and Trust, N.A. South Carolina Bank and Trust, the 4th largest bank headquartered in South Carolina, has been serving the needs of South Carolinians for over 70 years. SCBT Financial Corporation operates 34 financial centers in 12 South Carolina counties and has total assets exceeding $1.3 billion. SCBT Financial Corporation offers a full range of retail and commercial banking services including mortgage lending, trust and investment services, and consumer finance loans, and is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "SCBT."
