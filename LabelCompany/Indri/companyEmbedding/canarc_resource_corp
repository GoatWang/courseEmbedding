Projects




Projects
British Columbia
Introduction: 
Canarc’s core asset is the 100% owned, past-producing, high-grade, 1.1 million oz New Polaris gold mine project located in north-western British Columbia.
Location and Access:
The New Polaris project is situated in northwestern British Columbia, 100 km south of Atlin, B.C., and 60 km east of Juneau, Alaska, on the west bank of the Tulsequah River near the B.C. - Alaska border.
Small aircraft carrying personal and/or supplies can reach the site from Atlin or Juneau. Heavier mine equipment and supplies can be barged to the minesite via the Taku River.
Ownership:
Canarc holds a 100% interest in 61 crown granted mineral claims and 1 modified grid claim totaling 2,956 acres. The project is subject to a 15% net profits interest to Rembrandt Gold Mines, which can be reduced to 10% NPI. For 150,000 shares.
Current Status:
Canarc is now considering a feasibility work program to include 15000 meters of infill drilling to upgrade inferred resources, to measured and indicated resources, mine and plant engineering, environmental permitting and completing a feasibility study at an estimated cost of CA$9 million, subject to financing.
Economics:
Canarc updated its positive preliminary economic assessment of New Polaris in April 2011 for the construction of 72,000 oz per year high grade, underground gold mine. Click here to view.

In the new base case preliminary economic model, higher gold prices appear to have a significant positive impact on the New Polaris gold mine project economics. Using new parameters for the gold price ($US 1,400 per oz), $CA /$US exchange rate (1.00) and cash costs (US$481 per oz), the updated Moose Mountain PEA generates a discounted (5%) after-tax Net Present Value ("NPV") of CA$195 million with an after-tax Internal Rate of Return ("IRR") of 42.8% and a 1.9 year pay-back period. On a pre-tax basis, the undiscounted life-of-mine cash flow totals $272 million.
Mining History:
Prospectors discovered gold at New Polaris in 1929. The mine, then known as Polaris Taku, was built in 1937 and commissioned a year later. It operated until 1942, shut down due to World War II, and then restarted in 1946 and operated until 1951. In 1951, a barge loaded with gold concentrate sunk off of the coast of BC in a violent storm. As a result the mine closed. Cominco owned and operated the nearby Tulsequah Chief and Big Bull deposits and in 1952 leased the site Polaris-Taku site and upgrade the mill to process ores mined from these deposits. This continued until 1957. During the mines operation, a total of 232,000 oz. gold was produced from 691,000 tonnes of ore grading 11.9 grams per tonne (0.35 oz./ton). Gold concentrates were shipped to a smelter in Tacoma, Washington for refining. About 15,796 m of under-ground development on 10 levels, and 3,747 m of raise development were completed at New Polaris. The deepest level of the mine is 187 m below sea level. A 250 m internal winze was used to haul ore to the main haulage access level. Mining methods included long-hole, shrinkage and resuing.

New Polaris then lay dormant for 30 years until exploration resumed in 1988. Canarc acquired New Polaris in 1992 and since has drilled 241 holes totaling 64,000 m of core, outlining significant new ore below and beyond the old mine workings.
Resource (NI 43-101 compliant)
Updated February 1st 2007, and using a 6 gram per tonne cutoff (0.17 oz per ton), the total resource at New Polaris is 1,155,000 oz gold contained within 2,916,000 tonnes of mineralized vein material at an average grade of 12.3 grams per tonne (0.36 oz. per ton). Greater than 95% of the measured and indicated resources are located within the C vein system where infill drilling programs were conducted over the past three years. Approximately 75% of the inferred resources are also located within the C vein system, with the remainder attributable to the Y19 and Y20 veins. See the tables below for the breakdown of the resource categories.

February 1, 2007: Canarc Reports Updated NI 43-101 Resource Estimate For New Polaris Gold Project, British Columbia 
Gary Giroux,  MASc., P.Eng. is the Qualified Person who prepared the NI 43-101 resource estimate set out above.  The complete NI 43-101 report, titled "Resource Potential New Polaris", is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and was filed on March 16, 2007.
James Moors, B.Sc., P.Geo, Vice President, Exploration, is the Qualified Person responsible for the project quality assurance and quality control, infill drilling, and geological modelling on the New Polaris property.
Geology and Gold Mineralization
Gold occurs in finely disseminated arsenopyrite that permeates the silica/sericite/fuchsite-altered wall rocks of almost barren quartz-carbonate veins. The white quartz-carbonate veins developed late in the mineralizing hydrothermal system and remobilized rare free gold into some late quartz/stibnite veins.
The mineralized veins are hosted within Paleozoic-aged mafic volcanic rocks and are developed along three principal vein sets adjacent to a major crustal break. Gold mineralization is late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary, and is very similar in terms of wallrock alteration, style of mineralization and host rock material to well-known Archean lode gold deposits such as Goldcorp's multi-million ounce Red Lake deposit.
Gold mineralization occurs along three major vein sets:
1.      AB shear veins - trending northwest/southeast,
2.      Y extension veins - trending north/south,
3.      C shear veins - trending east/west
C-veins generally link with the AB and with the Y veins at "junction arcs". Gold values within the veins show excellent continuity and uniformity, with very little nugget effect. Individual zones pinch, swell, and overlap en echelon. Width of gold mineralization ranges from 0.3 to 15 m in thickness, but tends to average about 3 m.
Metallurgy:
Historically, the mine operated at a rate of 200 tons per day. Ore was crushed through primary and secondary crushers, and ground in a ball mill. A standard flotation circuit was used to concentrate the ore prior to being shipped off site. Historical gold recoveries averaged 90% and concentrate grades ranged from 3.5 - 5.0 oz per ton gold.
Canarc performed extensive metallurgical test work that utilized flotation, cyanidation of the flotation tailings, and pressure oxidation (autoclaving) of the flotation concentrate.  These tests achieved an average recovery of 94%. Additional metallurgical test work is planned to optimize the process.
Site Infrastructure:
Canarc constructed a new bunkhouse and dry at the New Polaris mine site and the camp is now capable of supporting 35 people. Several existing buildings have been refurbished and serve as both sleeping quarters and the kitchen facility. The machine shop has also been maintained as a maintenance facility.

Canarc Resource Corp.: Near-Term Producer Looks Undervalued - Canarc Resource Corp. (OTCMKTS:CRCUF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Canarc Resource Corp.: Near-Term Producer Looks UndervaluedApr. 4.16 | About: Canarc Resource (CRCUF) Charles Sherwood Gold & precious metals, commoditiesSummaryCanarc Resource Corp. is fully permitted and finalizing financing for its El-Compas Mine.Shares are trading at less than half the npv of the El-Compas project.I expect shares to move higher as key milestone are achieved. Canarc Resource Corp. (OTCBB: OTCQB:CRCUF) owns the El Compas gold-silver mine in Zacatecas, Mexico which is fully permitted. Management is currently negotiating the terms of an $8 million debt financing deal in the form a gold prepaid facility which will provide the capital needed for mine construction. To this end Canarc Resource Corp. has entered into an indicative term sheet and management is hoping to have the terms of the deal finalized in the next 60 days. Mine construction is anticipated to start in June with production at the end of 2016, making Canarc Resource Corp. a near-term producer. 

 CRCUF data by YCharts The El-Compas Deposit is quite high grade with indicated gold resources of 6.55 Au grams per ton and indicated silver resources of 66.2 Ag grams per ton. A preliminary economic assessment was completed in January 2016 which indicates very favorable project economics. All-in sustaining costs are estimated to be a very low $614 an ounce and capital construction costs are estimated at only $7.6 million. The project carries an after tax net present value of $39.5 million at a gold price of $1200 an ounce compared to Canarc Resource Corp.'s current market cap of under $20 million. The internal rate of return is 96.6% with a payback period of 1.8 years. With the market cap at roughly half the after tax npv of the El-Compas project and financing likely to be finalized soon I believe there is a lot of potential upside.  Sensitivity- NPV (After tax) based on Discount Rate and Commodity Price Variation  Discount Rate $900 oz $1,000 oz $1,100 oz $1,200 oz $1,300 oz   3% $21.1mil $28.5 mil $35.6 mil $42.7 mil $49.7 mil   4% $20.2mil $27.3 mil $34.2 mil $41.0 mil $47.8 mil   5% $19.3mil $26.2 mil $32.9 mil $39.5 mil $46.0 mil   6% $18.4mil $25.1 mil $31.6 mil $37.9 mil $44.2 mil   7% $17.6mil $24.1 mil $30.3 mil $36.5 mil $42.6 mil   With the price of gold rising to over $1200 an ounce in recent months, the El-Compas project is looking quite attractive. Mine construction is expected to take only 6 months and with the project fully permitted and the financing likely to be completed soon, I feel confident that the project will be completed successfully. Mexico is a stable mining jurisdiction and Canarc Resource Corp. has signed a lease agreement to process ore at the Zacatecas Government Mill which should create a strong relationship with the local government. With very low AISC, El-Compas should produce margins of roughly $600 an ounce in the current gold environment and can remain quite profitable even at lower gold prices while providing leverage to rising gold prices. At this point I see the main risk as being the uncertainty regarding the terms of the $8 million financing which will be disclosed in the next 60 days. If the deal is unfavorable for Canarc Resource Corp. it could place a burden on the company. However, with the monetary amount of the deal being only $8 million with an option for up to $10 million, I think the risk level is fairly low. The other main risk is in regard to issues with mine construction (as shareholders of Rubicon Minerals know only too well) and potential cost overruns and delays. Of course all mining projects carry this risk but in Canarc Resource Corp's case this is partly mitigated by the fact that they will be utilizing the Zacatecas Government Mill for ore processing which they have signed a 5 year lease with. This greatly reduces capital costs and permitting and makes mine construction a lot more straightforward. Canarc Resource Corp. also own the New Polaris project in British Columbia for which they have completed a PEA and are advancing towards a feasibility study. The results of the PEA look promising with an after tax npv of CA$ 129.8 million at $1200/oz gold. The internal rate of return is not quite as high as I would like at 31.4% but is still fairly decent and the payback period is 2.5 years. Cash costs are estimated at a low US$481 an ounce. Annual production would be approximately 100,000 ounces so if Canarc Resource Corp. can bring New Polaris to production it would transform them from a micro-cap miner to more of a traditional small cap miner. Capital costs to construct New Polaris are estimated at CA$100 million which means that while some of the funding would come from cash flow from El-Compas there would definitely have to be financing as well. At this point, while New Polaris looks promising it's hard to ascribe too much value to the project until their feasibility study is completed and they make substantial permitting progress. While Canarc Resource Corp's share price has risen quite a bit over the last several months, I believe there is plenty of upside left. I would expect shares to move higher as key milestones are achieved including completion of the term sheet, beginning of mine construction, first gold pour and declaration of commercial production. Of course if there are delays, cost overruns or any other issues this will negatively affect share price. While share price will be partly tied to achieving key milestones, the price of gold itself will have a large impact on share price if it moves substantially higher or lower from current prices. With such a small market cap Canarc Resource Corp. is a very risky investment and definitely not recommended for the risk averse. However for those willing to take risk, I would recommend accumulating shares on any dips in share price. I believe Canarc Resource Corp. will successfully bring El-Compas online over the next year and as long as the price of gold doesn't drop too much I think we will see the stock price trend up towards the npv of El-Compas as key milestones are achieved.

The agreement, struck last August, gave Canarc an exclusive option to acquire up to a 75% interest in the asset


 

A permit has been received recently for FG, which allows the drilling of up to ten holes in the northwest area of the property.








	Precious metals group Canarc Resource Corp (CVE:CCM) has terminated its option deal with Eureka Resources on the FG property in British Columbia.

	The agreement, struck last August, gave Canarc an exclusive option to acquire up to a 75% interest in the FG Gold Property, which lies100km east of Williams Lake.

	A permit has been received recently for FG, which allows the drilling of up to ten holes in the northwest area of the property.

	Canarc said Eureka wants to find a new exploration partner for the property, or conduct its own drilling program on the interpreted offset of the Main zone, discovered by Eureka in 2016 from a thorough reinterpretation of a 2007 airborne survey.

	Historical exploration has established an NI 43-101 measured and indicated resource of 376,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.776 gram per tonne gold, using a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
