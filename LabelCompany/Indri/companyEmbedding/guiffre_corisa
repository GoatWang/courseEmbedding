TaxBuzz uses basic business information from third-party data providers. We have built our database from these public records and sources. In the process, some of the data may appear out-of-date. We allow business owners to claim their listings to make sure we are showing the most accurate profiles and contact information.
This profile has been flagged as possibly being out-of-date, and it may mean the professional is no longer practicing or has not renewed their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) with the IRS which is required to prepare and sign tax returns.

IRS Annual Filing Season Program Participant




This individual is a participant in the IRS's voluntary tax preparer program, which generally includes the passage of an annual testing requirement (1) and the completion of a significant number of hours of continuing education. Preparers satisfying these educational requirements and agreeing to abide by the IRS's rules are allowed to represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only before revenue agents, customer service representatives, and similar IRS employees, including the Taxpayer Advocate Service. This extremely important privilege is not extended to tax preparers who are not attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents. To be eligible, tax preparers must complete the AFSP requirement every tax year.
(1) In states that have their own program; the annual testing requirement is waived.

Andrea Electronics Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2004 Results; Closing in on Breakeven Operating Performance; Current Quarter Financials Prepared on a Going Concern Basis | Business Wire
























































Andrea Electronics Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2004 Results; Closing in on Breakeven Operating Performance; Current Quarter Financials Prepared on a Going Concern Basis






November 11, 2004 08:01 AM Eastern Standard Time



				MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 11, 2004--Andrea Electronics Corporation (AMEX: AND) today reported that net revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 were approximately $1.3 million as compared to net revenues of $1.2 million for the same quarter in 2003. Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 was approximately $0.3 million, and a basic and diluted loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.01 per share, as compared to a net loss of approximately $1.1 million, or a basic and diluted loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.05 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2003.  Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were approximately $4.2 million, inclusive of sales returns recovery - restructuring of $0.2 million, versus net revenues of $3.7 million for the same nine month period in 2003. Net loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 was approximately $1.3 million, and a basic and diluted loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.06 per share, as compared to a net loss of approximately $0.7 million, and a basic and diluted loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.05 per share, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003. The net loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003 included income from discontinued operations of approximately $2.5 million, or basic and diluted income attributable to common shareholders of $0.11 per share. 

 "While sequential quarterly net revenues increased modestly in the current quarter, net revenues in the first nine months of 2004, inclusive of sales returns recovery - restructuring of $0.2 million, represented a 13% increase as compared to the first nine months of last year," stated Corisa L. Guiffre, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Additionally, research and development and general, administrative and selling expenses combined for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004 decreased 33% and 28%, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. Andrea has now put forth five consecutive quarters of declining non-impairment related operating losses, which continues to evidence the Company's overall fiscal progress," Ms. Guiffre concluded.  "During the third quarter of 2004, we continued to close in on our strategic goal of minimally achieving breakeven operating performance," stated Paul E. Donofrio, President and Chief Executive Officer. "While current quarter net revenues grew modestly, Andrea's operating expenses have continued to decline especially in the research and development area. Overall, the Company's current quarter net loss has been reduced by nearly 70% as compared to the same period last year. Notwithstanding these notable strides, a concerted and dedicated effort still remains in terms of securing greater market penetration of our computer headset and digital products," Mr. Donofrio concluded.  For the third quarter of 2004, Andrea Anti-Noise Products revenues were approximately $0.6 million, as compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2003. For the third quarter of 2004, Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products revenues were approximately $0.7 million as compared to $0.6 for the third quarter of 2003. The increase in the Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products revenues is primarily attributable to increased product shipments to several of our OEM customers.  For the first nine months of 2004, Andrea Anti-Noise Products revenues were approximately $2.1 million, inclusive of sales returns recovery - restructuring of $0.2 million, as compared to $1.9 million for the first nine months of 2003. For the first nine months of 2004, Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products revenues were approximately $2.1 million as compared to $1.8 for the first nine months of 2003. The increase in the Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products revenues is primarily attributable to increased product shipments to several of our OEM customers.  At September 30, 2004, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.4 million. Total assets were approximately $8.4 million with total current assets of approximately $3.5 million. Total liabilities were approximately $2.6 million with total current liabilities of approximately $2.3 million. Total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2004 was approximately $5.8 million, which increased approximately $8.3 million from the December 31, 2003 total shareholders' deficiency of approximately $2.5 million. This increase is primarily due to the reclassification of previously redeemable preferred stock from temporary equity to permanent equity as a result of the balance sheet restructuring and capital infusions that took place during the first half of 2004.  The Company has implemented several measures in an effort to reduce expenses and to help preserve cash. The Company continues to pursue additional financial as well as strategic sources of capital. These efforts could include the sale of assets of the Company. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in its attempts to raise sufficient capital essential to the Company's survival. To the extent that the Company is unable to raise the necessary operating capital, it will not be able to develop and implement a business plan, and it will become necessary to curtail or cease operations. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient operating capital, there can be no assurances that the net proceeds will be sufficient enough to enable it to develop its business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. As such, the Company's third quarter condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
