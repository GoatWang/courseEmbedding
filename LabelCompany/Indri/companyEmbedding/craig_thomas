Craig Thomas has worked as a Product Designer since graduating in Industrial Design in 1995. Based in Cape Town, South Africa he has worked in various fields of design:
• Furniture & lighting
• Exhibition design
• Point of sale
• Promotional/merchandise design/packaging
• Homeware
 
These products are all diverse in material & processes, from injection moulded plastic to blown glass & metals. Craig enjoys the challenge of new materials & processes never knowing where they will lead. In an attempt at self production he started a small factory in 1998, designing & producing products in a polyconcrete material. These products range from wash hand basins, lighting and domestic products, to furniture. The flexible nature of the operation allows him to produce limited products customised to client specification.
 
CKT Design became the main supplier of products to Ikhaya Design, another company founded in 2001 by Craig Thomas and Alan Marsh, to service the hotel industry. For the past 10 years they have worked extensively for the Hospitality Industry, designing for leading large& small hotels extending the length and breadth of Africa. Products have ranged from small items like amenities & soap dishes to signage, furniture & lighting features. Sustainability & ethical business practice are also very important in Craig's design ethic.
 
Since 2012 has lectured part time in ”Three dimensional design” to Industrial design Students at the Cape Town University of Technology (CPUT).
 




I enjoy the whole process of design from concept development to the delivery of a completed product. Interested in sustainability & ethical business practice.

Click on the pictures below to learn more the pests and rodents that are found throughout the Hudson Valley region.MiceRatsDear Mr. Thomas, I have been meaning to write to say how happy I am with your pest control service for quite a while. Our problems with rats, mice and moths are totally gone. Your technicians do a first class job, they are: professional, diligent and friendly. A class act all around. This week you sent a team of Cary, Brendan W. and Sean M. to install roof insulation, and I can’t say enough good things: they did a fantastic job from start to finish, When Cary noticed that there was a insufficient roof ventilation, he quoted me an estimate to install roof vents, went to Lowes and bought them, jumped up on the roof and had them installed by the time his colleagues had finished pumping the insulation. I am hugely impressed with your company and your people. You deserve every success, and I will have no hesitation, whatsoever in recommending you to friends.BatsSquirrelsNative animals in North America, comprising several genera of which Sciurus seems to be the most important with respect to their structural nuisance potential. The Eastern Gray Squirrel is very widely found, due to its introduction from its native eastern U.S. into the western states. Fox squirrels also represent a large group of widespread species.MolesRaccoonsSnakesWildlifeCraig Thomas Pest Control, in partnership with Orkin Pest Control, is a full-service pest management company servicing the entire Hudson Valley Region.

Fruit trees also may suffer damage from their feeding, and they also consume nuts, insects, mushrooms, and bird eggs. Food is carried in cheek pouches and stores are placed in the burrow for consumption later, including during the winter when the animal awakens from its hibernation on regular intervals to feed and then return to sleep. Burrows are normally underground, but some species also create nests in trees, which they use part of the day. Adults are capable of living for up to 8 years, but in nature a maximum of 3 to 4 years is normal. Mating is in mid spring, and a single litter per year is normal, with 4 to 8 young per litter.Insects and SpidersAntsSummer. During the summer time, our addition is placed mainly on the exterior while ants and bees are at the peak. A full exterior treatment and inspection will be formed along with removing accessible nests.

Funding the Future (April, 2016)
AmCap proudly sponsored Green Eco Builders during the latest Circuit of the Americas race in Austin, Texas. A 16-hour race (eight on Saturday, eight on Sunday), it was both a challenge and a thrill. Green Eco Builders finished 3rd on Saturday despite colliding with a spinning car in front of their race car. The damage to the car was so severe, driver changes had to occur through the car window, due to the door being smashed shut. “We were running well mid-way through Sunday, when we blew out our motor,” said George Kopecky, founder of Green Eco Builders. “Oh well, that’s racing!”

Dedication Through Service (April, 2016)
Success smelled super sweet at the 4th Annual BBQ & Crawfish Boil, a joint project between AmCap, AmCap Hope Tree and AmCap Premier. A huge thank you goes out to all the volunteers that tirelessly worked to serve over 600 people! Organizer Chris Parrish stated, “We are always proud to work for a company that supports our community involvement and encourages us to celebrate company wide.”




 





































 



 
 




 




 
Building a Better Future (March, 2016)
AmCap’s own Maria Salazar, Connie Chambers and Julia Null participated in EllieCares’ employee-run volunteer program. Together with the Patrick Kelley Youth Foundation, EllieCares assembles bicycles for underprivileged and at-risk Las Vegas children.




 































 



 
 



 




 
Donate for Date Night (January, 2016)

Major Mortgage donated dozens of toys to the Salvation Army this Christmas thanks to a clever incentive giving employees the chance to win a gift card to one of four local eateries for each toy donated and, of course, the kind generosity of their entire team.




 
AmCap Toy Drive (December, 2015)
AmCap collected a total of $6,415 in donations from employees and spent it at numerous stores, including Walmart, Ross, Toys R Us and Target. We purchased just over 500 items in total, which we donated to four Houston area charities and one deserving family.




 



















 



 
 








 
Partnering to Make a Big Difference (November, 2015)

AmCap co-sponsored last November’s IMG Financial Group Charity Golf Classic Tournament, benefitting The Folds of Honor Foundation, an organization that provides scholarships and financial assistance to the children and families of those killed or disabled while serving our country.




 
Racing for the Cure (October, 2015)

On October 4, 2015, members of the AmCap family joined with 25,000 other Houstonians to participate in the annual Race for the Cure event. Together with our community, we helped to raise more than $1 million for breast cancer treatment.




 
Habitat for Humanity

      AmCap has become a loyal partner of Habitat for Humanity. As an AmCap family, we are committed to donating funds and volunteer hours to build homes around the country for families in need.




 
V.A. Loan Program
AmCap recognizes the sacrifices our military heroes make. We offer quality loans to the men and women of the armed forces to ensure they have a place to call home when they return from duty.
To learn more about our V.A. Loan Program, contact the AmCap location nearest you.
“You have absolutely lived up to your reputation of operating in excellence. You have gone way above and beyond to make this happen for us, and we can't thank you enough for all you have done for our family and so many other veterans here in the great state of Texas. Please let us know if there is anything we can do for you in the future. We count it a blessing to have worked with the very best in the business. Thanks again!”
Will Witherspoon, Master Sergeant, USAF (ret.)
