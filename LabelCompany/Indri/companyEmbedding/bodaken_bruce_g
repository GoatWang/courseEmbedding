A native of Iowa, Mr. Bodaken doesn™t fit the typical profile of a health plan CEO.  He earned a masters degree and taught philosophy at the college level before embarking on a career in health care.
During Mr. Bodaken™s six-year tenure as CEO, Blue Shield has been one of the fastest growing health plans in California. Membership has more than doubled and company revenues have risen from $3 billion to $8 billion. In the past several years, the company won vigorous competitions for two large government contracts, covering nearly 400,000 state employees in CalPERS and half a million members of U.S. military families enrolled in the TRICARE program.
Passionate about his company™s not-for-profit mission, Mr. Bodaken is the first health plan CEO to offer a specific proposal to cover all Californians. His provocative plan for universal coverage based on universal responsibility has earned praise from major news organizations throughout the country. During his tenure, he also transformed the Blue Shield of California Foundation into one of the state™s largest healthcare grant makers, with nearly $30 million in donations in 2005.  Most of the foundation™s grants support programs to help the uninsured, combat domestic violence, and expand the use of effective healthcare technology.
In addition to his work at Blue Shield, Mr. Bodaken serves on numerous professional and civic boards. He is a member of the board of directors of the California Business Roundtable, America™s Health Insurance Plans, WageWorks, the University of California, Berkeley™s Health Services Management Program, and Youth Tennis Advantage (a nonprofit that serves inner-city youth).  He is co-author (with Robert Fritz) of The Managerial Moment of Truth, published by Simon & Schuster (Free Press) in 2006.
Mr. Bodaken joined Blue Shield in 1994 as president and chief operating officer.
Previously, he served as senior vice president and associate chief operating officer of FHP International Corporation in Southern California. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.

IRhythm Technologies Names UC Berkeley Faculty Member Bruce G. Bodaken And Duke University Chancellor Emeritus Ralph Snyderman, M.D. To Its Board Of Directors






GlobeNewswire



Jul 19, 2017 9:10 AM EDT













 




























































 SAN FRANCISCO, July 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iRhythm Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:IRTC), a leading digital health care solutions company focused on the advancement of cardiac care, announced today the appointment of Bruce G. Bodaken, member of the faculty at University of California, Berkeley in the Division of Health Policy Management, and Ralph Snyderman, M.D., Chancellor Emeritus and James B. Duke Professor of Medicine at Duke University to its Board of Directors. Mr. Bodaken will chair the compensation committee and Dr. Snyderman will serve as a member of the company's audit committee. "We look forward to the significant contributions that our new Board members will make," said Kevin King, President and CEO of iRhythm Technologies. "As our healthcare system rapidly evolves, both our customers and iRhythm must be mindful of the critical balance which must be struck between business and clinical decision-making to optimize patient care. Mr. Bodaken and Dr. Snyderman will be instrumental in helping to understand and guide us through that interplay, drawing from their strong respective experiences as leaders in the healthcare payer and clinical practice fields. Their skills and backgrounds will be complementary to the strong operational and financial skills possessed by our existing board members, making for a strong group with a unique diversity of talent."  Mr. Bodaken has a proven track record of thought leadership in the healthcare payer space. Prior to joining the faculty at UC Berkeley, he was Chairman and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of California from 2000 to 2012 where he was responsible for strategy and management of California's third largest insurer. He previously served as Blue Shield of California's President and Chief Operating Officer from 1996 to 2000. Mr. Bodaken serves on the Board of Directors of the Rite Aid Corporation and on the Board of Directors of Wageworks, Inc. Mr. Bodaken earned a master's degree from the University of Colorado and a bachelor's degree from Colorado State University.

iRhythm Technologies Names Former Blue Cross Blue Shield of California CEO Bruce G. Bodaken and Duke University Chancellor Emeritus Ralph Snyderman, M.D. to its Board of Directors
SAN FRANCISCO – July 19, 2017 – iRhythm Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRTC), a leading digital health care solutions company focused on the advancement of cardiac care, announced today the appointment of Bruce G. Bodaken, former Chairman and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of California, and Ralph Snyderman, M.D., Chancellor Emeritus and James B. Duke Professor of Medicine at Duke University to its Board of Directors. Mr. Bodaken will chair the compensation committee and Dr. Snyderman will serve as a member of the company’s audit committee.
“We look forward to the significant contributions that our new Board members will make,” said Kevin King, President and CEO of iRhythm Technologies. “As our healthcare system rapidly evolves, both our customers and iRhythm must be mindful of the critical balance which must be struck between business and clinical decision-making to optimize patient care. Mr. Bodaken and Dr. Snyderman will be instrumental in helping to understand and guide us through that interplay, drawing from their strong respective experiences as leaders in the healthcare payer and clinical practice fields. Their skills and backgrounds will be complementary to the strong operational and financial skills possessed by our existing board members, making for a strong group with a unique diversity of talent.”  
Mr. Bodaken has a proven track record of thought leadership in the healthcare payer space. Prior to serving as Chairman and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of California from 2000 to 2012 where he was responsible for strategy and management of California’s third largest insurer, he served as Blue Shield of California’s President and Chief Operating Officer from 1996 to 2000. Mr. Bodaken serves on the Board of Directors of the Rite Aid Corporation and on the Board of Directors of Wageworks, Inc. Mr. Bodaken earned a master’s degree from the University of Colorado and a bachelor’s degree from Colorado State University.
Dr. Snyderman has made significant contributions to the advancement of health care over the course of his career. Dr. Snyderman is Chancellor Emeritus, James B. Duke Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Center for Research on Personalized Health Care at Duke University. From 1989 to 2004, he served as Chancellor for Health Affairs at Duke and was the founding CEO and President of the Duke University Health System. He was a venture partner with New Enterprise Associates from 2006 to 2009. Dr. Snyderman currently serves on a variety of health care related boards. He is a member of the Association of American Physicians, where he served as president from 2003 to 2004, the Association of American Medical Colleges, where he served as chair from 2001 to 2002, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Dr. Snyderman earned a bachelor’s degree from Washington College, a doctorate of medicine from the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, and completed his internship and residency in Medicine at Duke University.
