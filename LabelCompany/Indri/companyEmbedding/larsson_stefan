Stefan Larsson on Value-Based Health Care

Stefan Larsson is the global leader of The Boston Consulting Group’s health care payers and providers sector. He has been a Fellow since 2010.
Stefan’s research focuses on the topic of value-based health care—that is, how transparency within health care outcomes and patient group costs will drive the transformation of health care systems. Health care costs have risen two to three times faster than economic growth over the past 20 years, and governments and other payers' approach of focusing on managing costs has had limited success. He presented the topic of value-based health care during his TED talk "What Doctors Can Learn from Each Other" as part of a series of talks curated by TED and BCG.
Stefan is also BCG's representative to a new collaboration, the International Consortium of Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM), cofounded by BCG, Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School, and the Karolinska Institute.

Since joining BCG in 1996, Stefan has worked extensively for clients across the health care industry on issues of strategy, organizational redesign, operational effectiveness, R&D effectiveness, regulatory issues, drug safety, manufacturing, in-licensing strategy, and commercial compliance.

Prior to joining BCG, Stefan was an associate professor at the Karolinska Institute. He has published 22 articles in peer-reviewed international journals.

						Stefan Larsson and Ralph Lauren					

								AP						











The lovefest between Ralph Lauren and Stefan Larsson didn’t last long.

Ralph Lauren Corp. said president and chief executive officer Stefan Larsson will leave the company on May 1.
The company, which will conduct a search for a new ceo, said it will continue to execute the Way Forward Plan laid out in June, now a hallmark of Larsson’s short tenure. Investors were rattled, sending shares of the company down 10.3 percent to $78.39 in midday trading.
Chief financial officer Jane Nielsen will lead the execution of the plan until the ceo search is completed.
Ralph Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer, said, “Stefan and I share a love and respect for the DNA of this great brand, and we both recognize the need to evolve. However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business. After many conversations with one another, and our board of directors, we have agreed to part ways. I am grateful for what Stefan has contributed during his time with us, setting us in the right direction with the Way Forward Plan.”

The executive chairman said the company has “built a strong foundation for future growth, including strengthening our team, refocusing our brands, evolving our products and our marketing, improving our operations and reducing our costs.”
Larsson said that the Way Forward Plan is “on track.” He added, “Ralph will always be an inspiration to me, and I am grateful to have had this experience.”

The news of Larsson’s departure was made on the same day the company posted third-quarter results for the period ended Dec. 31. Net income fell 37.4 percent to $82 million, or 98 cents a diluted share, from $131 million, or $1.54, a year ago. Net revenues were down 11.9 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.95 billion. By segment, both wholesale and retail net sales saw declines.
The company said wholesale net sales fell 26 percent to $582 million, while retail net sales slipped 2.2 percent to $1.1 billion. Consolidated comparable-store sales fell 5 percent, but were down 4 percent on a constant currency basis. Both components contributed to a net sales decrease of 12.1 percent to $1.67 billion for the quarter. The balance of revenues came from licensing income.
Of the quarterly results, Larsson said the company lowered inventory levels by 23 percent to better match demand and “significantly improved our ability to match supply to demand by reducing premarket commitments to 15 percent of our inventory buys for fall 2017 from 60 percent for fall 2016.”  
Larsson said that the firm was still on track to get halfway to its goal of a 9-month lead time by the end of the current fiscal year, and 90 percent by the end of the next fiscal year. 
The company also closed another 12 underperforming stores during the third quarter.

During the morning conference call to Wall Street analysts, Larsson said he remained confident about the ability of the management team to “drive the company back to high-performance.”
Larsson said that as he begins his transition, the company’s cfo will “take charge of the execution of our plan. Jane and I have been copilots since she joined and will work closely together to make this transition successful.”
Nielsen said on the call that the company’s improved discipline in the assortment creation is allowing “us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments…. As a result, we are by far much more informed, which will significantly improve our ability to manage inventory to demand. The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our product has been very positive.”
She said that the company has begun rebalancing its distribution and its off-price wholesale business, as well as looking at quality of sales initiatives in its direct-to-consumer e-commerce business.
“The actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site,” she said, adding that “E-commerce has been our over-promoted channel and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channels and reduce promotion depth. These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high-performance in North America. They are difficult, but necessary actions to build a healthy pace to grow from. We expect these actions to continue to the first half of fiscal 2018.”
Overseas, the cfo said store comps improved in Europe and in Asia, despite lower markdown rates.
She said the company is on track to close 50 stores in the current fiscal year, and has already shuttered 27 year-to-date. “That puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identify from store closures of approximately $70 million,” Nielsen said.
Company executives also spoke briefly about border adjustment taxes in response to an analyst question. They noted that “there’s not a lot of clarity right now on the various proposals” and that there’s a lot of speculation. One executive said the company is “closely monitoring any decisions made by the new administration. We obviously are looking across our supply chain and looking for opportunities to mitigate any impact that we might see.”
The company maintained current guidance for fiscal year 2017, which pegs revenues to decrease to a low double-digit rate as the company continues to execute on the Way Forward Plan. The guidance does not include severance payments in connection with Larsson’s departure. For the fourth quarter, the company said it expects revenues to be down mid-teens on a reported basis.

SAN FRANCISCO — For years, Stefan Larsson was Gap’s worst nightmare, as he led H&M’s dizzying expansion in the United States with a combination of designer chic and rock-bottom prices.Three years ago, Gap Inc. hired him, and gave him its most challenging brand, Old Navy.Since his arrival, Mr. Larsson has led a striking turnaround at the low-cost label, transforming Old Navy from a butt of jokes to its parent company’s crown jewel. Last year, Old Navy took in almost $6 billion in sales in the United States — almost as much in sales as the Gap and Banana Republic brands put together — and made up 40 percent of the company’s global revenue. Earnings due this week are expected to underscore Old Navy as Gap’s biggest driver of growth as its other big labels are struggling.Still, Old Navy faces a challenge in sustaining that strong growth in a world of cheap fashion that increasingly seems a race to the bottom.Mr. Larsson is unfazed. “I saw an unpolished diamond in Old Navy,” Mr. Larsson said in a recent interview — his first since taking the helm at the brand — in a corner of a bustling staff cafeteria at Old Navy’s San Francisco headquarters. “Everything starts and ends with product.”

Old Navy’s success so far under Mr. Larsson has been built on a level of attention to design that sellers of low-end, family-oriented clothes — including the old Old Navy — had not put into their wares. (Mr. Larsson calls that view of fashion the “clothes by the pound” approach and says it ignores the aspirations of low-income shoppers.) Continue reading the main story

The label’s newfound strength also points to a fundamental shift in the way people shop for clothes, as well as a new frugality for all but the wealthiest of shoppers in the United States. Matching a $10 T-shirt with a designer bag has become much more common, as shoppers grow more selective about what they will splurge on. And even as consumers benefit from lower gas prices and a stronger job market, cautious households — especially those with children — have preferred to invest in fundamentals like their cars or homes rather than their wardrobes.All that has been a boon to Old Navy. Sales at established stores jumped 11 percent in the fourth quarter, by far the fastest rate shown by a mass apparel brand in the critical holiday season.“Old Navy’s approach used to be selling commodities,” said Betty Chen, a retail analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. But the more stylish clothes and marketing that Mr. Larsson has brought to the brand have had “a strong halo effect,” Ms. Chen said, that has bolstered the brand’s image. “And price points are so much lower than Gap or Lululemon.”Conceived by Gap in the early 1990s as a response to efforts by rivals to undercut Gap on price, the marked-down version of itself was wildly successful at first. Shoppers were drawn by Old Navy’s promise to combine the style and quality of Gap clothing with the low prices and big selection of a Home Depot. The whimsical layout of the stores, with concrete floors and display cases fashioned from stripped-down school lockers, was a hit in the working-class neighborhoods where they opened. Within four years, sales at Old Navy reached $1 billion, the fastest rate at the time for any retailer. (Even Google took longer to reach that milestone.) Gap opened Old Navy stores at a breakneck pace.That expansion started to go awry in about 2000, right around the time that H&M, the Swedish fast-fashion juggernaut, opened its first store in the United States, in Manhattan. Its strappy dresses and sharp jackets were not only cheap, but also were straight off the fashion runways. Old Navy’s laid-back hoodies and campy ads started to feel uninspired by comparison. A partnership in 2007 with the celebrity designer Todd Oldham flopped. The recession took a huge bite out of retail spending, even at the low-end Old Navy. Its sales fell by more than $1 billion from 2006 to 2008. Morale hit a low.Brought in to rescue a brand in distress, Mr. Larsson set to work assembling a heavyweight team. He hired Ivan Wicksteed, former global creative director of Coca-Cola and the architect of brand makeovers at Converse and Cole Haan, as chief marketing officer. One of the first changes Mr. Wicksteed made was to liven up the company’s drab headquarters in San Francisco with pop photography and upbeat music.“It looked like a doctor’s office,” Mr. Wicksteed said. “You have to start with ground zero. You have to start with the employees. If you can’t get your own people to want to get on board and change direction, then you’ll never persuade your own customers to do it.”

Another important recruit, Jill Stanton, the former head of apparel at Nike, has transformed Old Navy’s approach to design. Previously, its merchants would buy clothes from higher-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue or Abercrombie & Fitch and pick pieces to adapt, often clumsily, for Old Navy stores.

“We were taking a product that was in the marketplace and we were bringing it to market maybe a year later,” Ms. Stanton said. “And our designers were designing for somebody else. So you used to get design teams say: ‘Well, I’m not sure if I’d wear that, but it’s O.K. for Old Navy.’ ”Ms. Stanton instead pushed to build Old Navy’s own design muscle, leaning on Gap’s supply chain to allow designers to quickly test various prints, shapes and sizes in small runs in stores before increasing the production of styles that were with a hit with shoppers. It shifted its collection from everyday or basic items to others that were on-trend and in season. Instead of hiring designers whose experience was in the low-price market, Old Navy hired top talent: an accessories and bag designer from Coach, athletic wear designers from Nike and Reebok, the men’s apparel director from North Face. (“They don’t start with cheap,” Ms. Stanton said.) Old Navy’s new ads, starring two comedy favorites, Amy Poehler and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, have gone viral.One of Old Navy’s biggest triumphs has been its pixie pants. Two years ago, just as Mr. Larsson’s team was getting the label’s new look off the ground, a designer on Old Navy’s women’s team noticed that blogs and runways were filling up with casual, slim-fitting pants. The design team “obsessed over every detail” — the fit, the cut just above the ankle — and quickly tested different prints and colors in stores. The pants were a hit.“We uniquely designed that pant, and then we put it to market and we tested it and we sold 2.4 million pairs last year,” Mr. Larsson said. “It’s one of the biggest revenue-generating styles that we have.”Mr. Larsson is on the hunt for his next big product.“If you were at Apple, nobody would say, ‘Let’s relaunch the iPhone 6.’ People would laugh, and say that’s crazy. But that’s what happens in the fashion industry,” he said. “If you keep competing with generic products, and a higher and higher discount, you’re going to lose. If Apple doesn’t continuously refresh its products and make them current, they’re dead. And that would happen here as well.”A new area that Old Navy has thrown itself into is active wear, for the first time investing heavily in performance fabrics, like breathable textiles. With sportswear, Old Navy is tapping into a trend that has swept through fashion, as sneakers and yoga pants take the place of jeans and pumps. But where a pair of yoga pants from Lululemon might cost almost $100, the same amount would outfit an entire family in performance wear at Old Navy, Ms. Stanton said.There are big challenges ahead for the company. For one, it starts to be compared against a year of strong sales, making further growth particularly difficult. In the first quarter of the year, same-store sales growth at Old Navy slowed to 3 percent, though it remained the fastest-growing Gap label.Rising wages overseas, as well as heightened scrutiny over working conditions at Gap’s foreign suppliers, also raise concerns over Old Navy’s low-price business model.

Some analysts also wonder whether the recent jobs growth or savings from gas prices will prompt some shoppers to graduate from Old Navy, rising up the luxury ladder. Mr. Larsson says he does not think so. Snobbishness in fashion is on its way out, he says, especially among younger generations.“The industry is traditionally built on the ladder, but I don’t know if people aspire to that anymore,” he said. “Times are changing, and prestige is being looked at differently.” Young shoppers, especially, will always want to save — “then they want to travel, experience things,” he said.“Sometimes when I shop at high-end brands, I get this look when I walk in, like people working there are screening me and asking: Are you good enough to be our customer?” Mr. Larsson said. “I hate it. And Old Navy is as an antidote to that.”

Conceptions in the Code
How Metaphors Explain Legal Challenges in Digital Times
Stefan Larsson

Oxford Studies in Language and Law

New combination of theory: Conceptual metaphor theory to better understand law when dealing with digital and technological change.
Also strengthens the link between metaphors and social norms
Explores the conceptual understanding of primarily digital phenomena and the normative preferences that guides how we behave around these phenomena








Conceptions in the Code
How Metaphors Explain Legal Challenges in Digital Times
Stefan Larsson
Oxford Studies in Language and Law



Description



Stefan Larsson's Conceptions in the Code makes a significant contribution to sociolegal analysis, representing a valuable contribution to conceptual metaphor theory. By utilising the case of copyright in a digital context it explains the role that metaphor plays when the law is dealing with technological change, displaying both conceptual path-dependence as well as what is called non-legislative developments in the law. The overall analysis draws from conceptual studies of "property" in intellectual property. By using Karl Renner's account of property, Larsson demonstrates how the property regime of copyright is the projection of an older regime of control onto a new set of digital social relations. Further, through an analysis of the concept of "copy" in copyright as well as the metaphorical battle of defining the BitTorrent site "The Pirate Bay" in the Swedish court case with its founders, Larsson shows the historical and embodied dependence of digital phenomena in law, and thereby how normative aspects of the source concept also stains the target domain. The book also draws from empirical studies on file sharing and historical expressions of the conceptualisation of law, revealing both the cultural bias of both file sharing and law. Also law is thereby shown to be largely depending on metaphors and embodiment to be reified and understood. The contribution is relevant for the conceptual and regulatory struggles of a multitude of contemporary socio-digital phenomena in addition to copyright and file sharing, including big data and the oft-praised "openness" of digital innovation.

Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer who built a fashion empire based on sweeping fantasies of country-club prep and the Wild West, is stepping down from his post as chief executive of the company.Taking the helm at Ralph Lauren is Stefan Larsson, a former H&M executive and president of Old Navy, Gap’s down-market brand, which he is credited with reviving. Old Navy has consistently been one of the few bright spots in Gap’s brand portfolio since Mr. Larsson, who is Swedish, took over in 2012, making him one of the most visible executives in retailing.The change may be viewed as a move by Ralph Lauren to get its financial house in order. Earnings at the upscale apparel company, known for its Polo brand, have been pressured by a strong dollar and intense competition in the luxury space. Its latest quarterly earnings of $1.09 a share topped analyst estimates, but revenue dipped 5.3 percent on a year-over-year basis. The company’s share price has slumped by almost half this year.In an interview, Mr. Lauren, 75, said he intended to remain active at the company he founded almost a half-century ago in roles as executive chairman and chief creative officer. Mr. Larsson will report to Mr. Lauren, though Mr. Lauren characterized their relationship as a “partnership.”

“When they start designing things I can’t understand, I’ll quit,” Mr. Lauren said, sitting with Mr. Larsson at his side at his offices on Madison Avenue, adorned with the rustic paraphernalia — a tin toy robot, cowboy boots — that Ralph Lauren’s stores have come to be known for.

“But I don’t feel like I’m stepping back now,” Mr. Lauren said.Still, Mr. Larsson’s appointment is the start of a succession at one of America’s best-known fashion houses, which, together with the likes of Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, helped put American style on the map.And it is the coming end of a golden era of American postwar designers: Ms. Karan stepped down from the helm of the house that bears her name this year; Mr. Klein stepped away from his namesake company in 2002.Mr. Larsson, 41, will take over as chief executive of the Ralph Lauren Corporation in November, and will also join the company’s board.“One of the biggest reasons for me to join is the opportunity to work side by side with someone like Ralph,” Mr. Larsson said. 



                Ralph Lauren Through the Years            

                Mr. Lauren has transformed his company into a quintessential American label with its ubiquitous logo of a mounted polo player holding a raised mallet.            











Most successful fashion brands are stories of two partners — Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé, Calvin Klein and Barry Schwartz, Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti, even Giorgio Armani and Sergio Galeotti. (Mr. Armani took over as chief executive after Mr. Galeotti died.)Mr. Lauren was the rare designer who could do both. Previously, he had a “partner” in Roger Farah, former chief operating officer and president who retired in 2013. Mr. Farah was succeeded by Jackwyn Nemerov, another respected executive whose tenure nevertheless coincided with sluggish sales, despite steep promotions.But Mr. Lauren’s decision to award Mr. Larsson the title of chief executive indicates that he, at least, feels it is still important to separate the roles and have a professional manager running the brand and reassuring Wall Street. Mr. Lauren is still the largest individual shareholder in his company, and is likely to have a hand in any major decisions.

Investors cheered the move, sending the stock as much as 5 percent higher in after-hours trading. The question of who might succeed Mr. Lauren after 48 years at the company’s helm had cast uncertainty over plans for the future. Mr. Lauren’s son, David, is on the board of directors and heads the company’s advertising and marketing divisions.Asked on Tuesday whether Mr. Larsson would be a good successor, Mr. Lauren replied, “I would say so.”Still, an appointment of a new chief executive from outside the company surprised some industry experts.“Ralph Lauren has been a poster child of stability and has historically grown talent from within,” said William Susman, managing director at Threadstone Partners, an advisory firm that focuses on the retail sector. “Bringing in Stefan must be a reflection of the need for new thinking.”

Ralph Lauren would benefit from change, experts say. Mr. Lauren’s most recent show at New York Fashion Week was an ode to Americans in Biarritz, with his signature perfect leather tailoring, blue and white evening gowns, and stars in the front row (Jessica Chastain, Julianne Moore). But his brand has a typical luxury pyramid structure, the model for both Calvin Klein and Michael Kors, with luxury at the pinnacle casting an aspirational halo over the more accessible Polo Ralph Lauren line. Factory stores below that form the bulk of the profits.Given Mr. Larsson’s track record in “fast fashion,” the question is whether the company will now take a different tack. Recent moves at the company, like separating out its luxury business, hiring the luxury executive Valerie Hermann and opening a lavish private members’ club in Milan, had suggested a stronger focus on luxury at the apparel company.Mr. Larsson has made his name in budget-conscious mass-retailing, first at H&M and then at Old Navy. Though even at those mass brands, Mr. Larsson’s success, experts say, has been built on fostering a level of attention to design that sellers of low-end, family-oriented apparel had previously not put into their wares.

Whether or not changes lie ahead for the company, it is a big moment for a fashion house that Mr. Lauren began in the streets of New York, selling ties out of rented drawer space in a closet of an office in the Empire State Building. Now, on top of its men’s and women’s clothing lines, Ralph Lauren has a foothold, through licensing, in everything from cosmetics to leather goods, to footwear and eyeglass frames. The company logged sales of $7.6 billion in its last fiscal year.Mr. Lauren’s success has made him a rich man. Though he remains a top shareholder, Mr. Lauren has sold off parts of his stake over the years. Just last week, he sold 50,000 Ralph Lauren shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, worth some $5.6 million.

Mr. Susman of Threadstone said that Ralph Lauren clearly wanted to incorporate some elements of fast fashion, given Mr. Larsson’s success in that arena. Mr. Larsson will also help Ralph Lauren bolster its international presence, which has become critical as the United States market has become saturated, Mr. Susman said.But he said that he did not expect Ralph Lauren to step away from building up the luxury side of the business.“I don’t envision that would change,” he said. “And they still have Ralph Lauren to handle it.”Mr. Lauren spoke of the unlikely match between his world of aspirational luxury, and that of Mr. Larsson’s, in mass retailing. A Ralph Lauren board member had spoken gushingly about a rising star in fashion, and recommended Mr. Lauren meet him.“So I said, ‘Where’s he from?’ And they told me: ‘Old Navy and H&M.’ I said: ‘Why would I be looking for that? We’re building a great luxury company.’ ”Even as the two met for a private dinner in New York, Mr. Lauren said, “I was thinking to myself: ‘Why am I here? It’s a waste of time.’ ”That feeling of initial unease was mutual, Mr. Larsson said. “I was hesitating. Why was he interested in speaking with me?” Mr. Larsson said.But the two hit it off.“I interviewed lots of people who were in luxury. But Stefan has a great quality that made me say: ‘You can be my new C.E.O.,’ ” he said. “He’s unique as a man, a man who’s capable of building businesses and growing companies, but at the same time he’s sensitive to people’s feelings.”And was there really something that Ralph Lauren could learn from H&M or Old Navy?“If I thought there was nothing I could learn from Stefan,” Mr. Lauren said, “he would not be here.”

Gap Inc. Names Global Brand President for Old Navy


Seasoned apparel executive from H&M, Stefan Larsson, to grow Old Navy’s domestic and international business



SAN FRANCISCO – April 30, 2012 – Completing a global search that began in February, Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today announced that Stefan Larsson, a veteran of nearly 15 years with the successful fashion retailer H&M, will become the first global brand president for Old Navy.  Larsson will join the company by October. The announcement comes as Gap Inc. prepares to open its first Old Navy store outside North America, in Japan, in July.  
“Stefan is a rising star within apparel retail, with proven experience in the value sector.  He’s tackled some of the most complex challenges in our industry and has a deep appreciation for the need to balance great product and operational excellence,” said Glenn Murphy, chairman and CEO of Gap Inc.  “Stefan understands Old Navy’s unique brand positioning and significant potential for future growth in North America and around the world.”
Over nearly 15 years, Larsson was part of the team responsible for growing H&M, with revenues increasing from about $3 billion to about $17 billion and operations expanding from 12 to 44 countries.  Larsson most recently served as head of Global Sales for H&M with responsibility for about 2,300 stores worldwide. His role encompassed all aspects of the business that are customer-facing:  product and visual merchandising, store operations, store design and development, inventory management, and customer service.  
Previously, Larsson was responsible for successfully orchestrating the company’s global expansion by leading real estate, store design and store construction.  Other roles included  overseeing the launch of H&M on the West Coast of the United States, and spending nearly seven years with the company in numerous global roles with responsibility for product, including merchandising, assortment development, planning and production for the company. 
Larsson said, “I’m passionate about the apparel industry, and I believe success starts with having amazing product in the ideal stores in each market.  Few brands capture the loyalty of consumers like Old Navy, and it’s incredibly exciting to have the opportunity to take this uniquely American and family-focused brand through its next phase of growth.”
Launched in 1994, Old Navy brings fun, fashion and value to the whole family.  Customers quickly connected with the brand, as Old Navy became the first retailer to reach $1 billion in annual sales in less than four years of operation.  At the end of fiscal year 2011, Old Navy operated 1,016 stores in North America, with net store sales of $5.04 billion.
“Given his accomplishments, product insights, and global outlook, Stefan’s vast experience not only benefits Old Navy but will help Gap Inc. on multiple levels,” Murphy added.  “He’s a strong addition to our senior management team.”
Larsson joined H&M in 1998, after earning his undergraduate and graduate degrees in business and economics in Scandinavia.    
Nancy Green, EVP & Chief Creative Officer, and Tom Sands, EVP of Stores and Operations, will continue to jointly lead Old Navy until Larsson joins the company later this year. Old Navy posted improved sales results in February and March, the first two months of the 2012 fiscal year.
