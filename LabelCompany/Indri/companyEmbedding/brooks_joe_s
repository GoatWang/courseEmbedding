There is no shortage of sales advertisements from vendors who would like your business: they're using preferred customer special offers, early parrot sales, midnight madness situations, coupon savings times, and pre- AND post-holiday sales. Precisely how do you select if their offers are real?The Federal government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection company, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday.

What to buy and what to skip at Trader Joe’s

By: Lisa Gosselin
 | 
Monday, February 7, 2011
















  If you ever want to start a conversation at a party, try asking this question: What are the best and worst deals at Trader
  Joe’s? It’s only slightly less controversial than health care reform.
ADVERTISEMENT

  Americans (and I include myself) are crazy about Trader Joe’s: there are Facebook pages, books about shopping there, even
  fan-run websites. What inspires this passion? Jovanna Brooks, founder of traderjoesfan.com and traderjoesguide.com, says, “The reason that there are so many really
  die-hard Trader Joe’s fans is because you can get incredibly unique items. It’s adventure shopping all the time because there
  are things that are constantly new. At the same time, people get upset when products get discontinued, but that’s part of the
  fun.”


  The company was started in Pasadena, California in 1958 by Joe Coulombe, as a small chain of convenience stores. Coulombe
  sold Trader Joe's in 1979 to the Albrechts, a German family which owns Aldi, an international chain of discount supermarkets.
  There are now 340 Trader Joe's in some 28 states but despite the expansion, the store has maintained its
  "I'm-your-neighborhood-grocer" quirkiness.


  Shoppers love the cheery, helpful checkout people in Hawaiian shirts, the wide array of new foods and the low-cost,
  private-label products that are often created by well-respected brands. While Trader Joe’s doesn’t like to name names (and
  did not return calls for this story), ardent shoppers and industry insiders say that you can find brand products, such as
  Amy’s prepared dishes or Callebaut chocolate, repackaged there under the Trader Joe’s label at a much lower cost.


  As Beth Kowitt wrote in a recent article for Fortune, “Inside the Secret World of Trader Joe’s”: “Those Trader Joe’s pita chips? Made by Stacy’s, a
  division of PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay. On the East Coast much of its yogurt is supplied by Danone’s Stonyfield Farm. And finicky
  foodies probably don’t like to think about how Trader Joe’s scale enables the chain to sell a pound of organic lemons for
  $2.”

  Leaving aside the food politics, my question is: are Trader Joe’s prices always better? I’ve been a fan for years and shopped
  stores from California to Connecticut. Even though prices often vary from place to place and can change day by day, as the
  editor of EatingWell I think I generally know what to look for there. But I’ve often been surprised. So I decided to
  see what other people thought.


Check It Out: What to Buy—and
  What to Skip—at Whole Foods


  In addition to talking with Brooks, I asked
  EatingWell’s Facebook fans to tell us what they thought are the best and worst deals at the store, and we got a slew of
  comments. Then, armed with a list and a calculator, I went to see how prices and perceptions match up. (For all my shopping
  comparisons, I checked prices on similar items in stores and on the websites of large chains, such as Stop & Shop, Safeway
  and Wegmans).


What to Skip


Pass on the Produce
  A pet peeve many people mention is the lack of fresh, local produce. “To be honest, the produce is not the best,” says
  Brooks. “It definitely leaves a lot to be desired.” I confess that I like to buy fresh and local whenever I can and Trader
  Joe’s cellophane-wrapped peppers and other produce don’t often inspire me. But to keep an open mind, I went to a Trader Joe’s
  and picked up a bundle of unwrapped asparagus.


  In this Connecticut store, rather anemic-looking spears were selling for $4.39 a pound, whereas the larger market down the
  street featured healthier-looking asparagus at $3.79 a pound or less.


  But not all deals are duds in the produce section; you just have to pick the right ones. Trader Joe’s is known for buying in
  bulk and produce that ships well seems to fare better here. Hass avocados were bundled in a bag of four for $3.29. That
  seemed worth it, especially when a nearby supermarket was selling four for $5. Granted, the Trader Joe’s avocados were small
  and hard but after I let them ripen for a day, they were delicious. I found similarly good deals and quality on sturdy
  produce like clementines and bananas too.


Skip the Meat
  One common comment we heard from our Facebook fans: “Best deal - milk, eggs and yogurt. Worst deal - prepackaged meats.”
  Brooks agrees: “You would think the meat would be fresh, but it’s just not the best and they don’t have an in-store butcher.”


  I went shopping for my favorite Black Angus rib-eye steak. It was almost $2 a pound more at Trader Joe’s. Boneless leg of
  lamb from New Zealand: $6.49 a pound (versus $4.99) and ground beef, $2.49 a pound versus $2.99. One exception is the organic
  meats: Trader Joe’s has made a push toward more organic ingredients and, at $6.99 a pound, organic, boneless, skinless
  chicken breasts are a go-to food for me, especially when it’s not always easy to find chicken that’s both organic and
  skinless.

  Should Buy Organic
15 Foods You Don’t Need
  to Buy Organic


Toss-Ups


Hit or Miss: Bakery and Prepared Foods
  Brooks considers deli items like sushi, ready-made sandwiches and salads, and the baked goods and breads—as really hit or
  miss. These items vary from store to store depending on local suppliers, so keep that in mind as you shop.


Watch Out for the Treats
  “You’re in there, you’re saving money, you’re getting good deals—and then they have some things you can’t say “No” to, like
  chocolate-covered almonds, gourmet cookies and Belgium chocolates, and some of those things can really add up,” says Brooks.
  “But in some cases those are also better deals than elsewhere,” so make sure to compare prices before you impulse-buy.


Must-Read: Packaged
  Foods You Can Feel Good About Eating


What to Buy


Cheese, Please!
  Everyone loves Trader Joe’s cheese selection and with good reason: they have cheeses that are both insanely good and insanely
  well priced. One Brooks says to look for: “Comté. An up-and-coming cheese that’s like a Gruyère.” I agree. And I can’t pass
  up a good deal on cheese. In fact, I have a stockpile of goat cheese because I can’t resist the giant 10-ounce log of Vermont
  Butter & Cheese Chèvre for just $4.99 (versus a 4-ounce log for $3.99, which I found at several other food stores and
  online).


Load Up on Staples
  If you shop the center of the store, it’s hard not to find great deals in pretty much every aisle, especially on staples like
  Trader Giotto’s Extra-Virgin Olive Oil for $5.49 a litre—more than $3 cheaper than I could find at other stores. Trader
  Joe’s-labeled almonds at $4.69 were nearly half as much as they cost elsewhere. Nature’s Path Flax-Plus Granola cereal: $2.89
  a box, versus $3.99. And my favorite, a bag of true wild rice—not mixed with long grain—for $4.99 a pound, versus $11 a pound
  and up at other stores.


Befriend the Freezer
  As for the freezer: my sister swears by Trader Joe’s frozen wild sockeye smoked salmon ($17.99 a pound, versus $27.96 a pound
  for smoked Atlantic salmon at other stores) and jumbo frozen wild scallops ($11.99 a pound, versus $15.99). The people we
  polled named all sorts of frozen appetizers and entrees as their favorite go-to meals. As Brooks says, “The nice thing is a
  lot of their stuff is frozen or shelf-stable—you just whip it out of the freezer or your pantry and you have a party.” Good
  deals include frozen rice, ethnic items like naan (an Indian bread) and frozen fruit, such as mango chunks. As for frozen
  meals, some top-sellers Brooks points to include Mandarin Orange Chicken, Penne Arrabiata and Tarte d’Alsace—a thin pizza
  topped with Gruyère cheese, creamy caramelized onions and ham.


Happy-Wallet Wine
  Perhaps the deal that Trader Joe’s is best known for? Cheap wine—so cheap in fact that when California stores began selling
  Charles Shaw wines at $1.99 a bottle, the brand earned the nickname Two-Buck Chuck. OK, maybe not a sommelier’s favorite, but
  for this and other wines under $20, you can usually take a few bucks off liquor-store pricing. As Brooks notes: “They have
  amazing deals for wine. For anywhere from $6 to $10 you can get a good bottle of wine—you would be surprised at how good it
  is. And then for $10 to $20 you get bottles that would be $20 to 30 elsewhere.”


  But what I think is the real beauty of Trader Joe’s is that it’s a place that inspires conversation. So you tell us, what do
  you think are the best and worst deals at the stores you shop?


Browse Beyond Food


  I could go on and on about the flowers ($9.99 for a dozen roses) and Phalaenopsis orchid plants are usually $3 to $4 less
  than you can find them at Home Depot (the next best place I’ve shopped for them), especially at West Coast locations. I also
  love the Trader Joe’s brand lavender body oil and soaps, and the grapefruit-scented shampoo smells lovely and its packaging
  is attractive.


  Lastly, one of the things I do love is that Trader Joe’s is making a concerted effort to do the right thing. In 2001, the
  company decided not to use any genetically-modified foods in its private label products and in 2007 made a commitment to
  eliminate added trans fats from all private label products (along with artificial colors, flavors, preservatives). Trader
  Joe’s branded eggs are all cage free and by 2012, the company promises that all of its seafood will be sustainably-sourced.


You tell us: What do you think are the best and worst deals at your Trader Joe's?

Zucchini Noodles with Avocado Pesto & Shrimp







21

Cut some carbs and use spiralized zucchini in place of noodles in this zesty pesto pasta dish recipe. Top with Cajun-seasoned shrimp to complete this quick and easy dinner.




Chipotle Chicken Quinoa Burrito Bowl







10

This chipotle-flavored burrito bowl recipe is even better than takeout and just as fast. Loading it with vegetables and using quinoa in place of rice adds nutrition for a healthy dinner.




Salsa-Black Bean Burgers







11

Salsa and some pantry staples give this vegetarian bean burger recipe tons of flavor. We use crushed tortilla chips to bind the burgers together, making them a great vehicle for using up those crumbs that inevitably fall to the bottom of the bag.




Grilled Salmon with Tomatoes & Basil 







17

This recipe is so beautiful and yet so simple to prepare--it's perfect for entertaining. You just spread a side of salmon with minced garlic, sprinkle with fresh basil, then layer sliced tomatoes on top. Put it on the grill for 10 minutes and you're done!




Baked Parmesan Tomatoes







40

A sprinkle of Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil transform tomatoes into the perfect side dish. Or try sandwiching them between slices of your favorite whole-wheat country bread.
