About Us








Our Story

Clothing should be comfortable and make you feel confident. 
Lawrence Hunt, a "professional performance" clothing brand, launched in December 2015, was founded because we believed that the dress shirt needed to be improved. It was uncomfortable and a pain to wear. A shirt worn as often as the dress shirt, whether at the office or to a formal occasion should be as comfortable, functional and stylish as a shirt worn on the golf course. It should look good, move/stretch, breathe, and you shouldn't have to worry about embarrassing sweat stains when you lift up your arms.
You should not have to compromise style for comfort, or vice versa. Lawrence Hunt believes you can have both. The Lawrence Hunt shirt is the first to combine two distinct fabrics into one article of clothing to take advantage of the benefits of both fabrics.
Lawrence Hunt's initial beta white men's dress shirt has grown into complete apparel lines for both men and women. Lawrence Hunt clothing applies the same concepts and technologies used to make an athlete's uniform breathable, comfortable and resistant to sweat stains to its complete line of dress shirts.

Recent Press: dbusiness I Seattle Post I San Francisco Gate I Lucky Mag Why we need you?We have created a high-end dress shirt that is perfect for the boardroom or a wedding, but that is also light-weight and breathable to help you stay cool.  

We have perfected the balance between the crisp and professional look of a traditional cotton dress shirt and the performance features of athletic-wear.  Our shirts are ready to go and we now need additional capital to increase our production and expand our marketing efforts.
InspirationWe were tired of feeling uncomfortable in meetings and outdoor weddings.  We wanted a shirt that was light-weight and breathable, but that would also look professional.  To create this perfect dress shirt, we turned to Major League Baseball.  Working with one of the top fashion designers in the country and former lead designer for some of the top brands in America, we applied the concepts from a pitcher's uniform to a men's dress shirt.




 And the Lawrence Hunt Dress Shirt was born...



The original classic white dress shirt


The ShirtWe spent countless hours finding the right fabrics to create a high-end dress shirt that is also flexible, breathable, and moisture-wicking. Our 100% cotton fabrics come from upstate New York, use Egyptian cotton, and are woven and finished in Japan.    Our moisture-wicking athletic-wear comes from Los Angeles.  It is 100% polyester, made from recycled PET bottles, and uses Body Care with Quick Dry function technology.  This keeps the body dry and comfortable by absorbing moisture and perspiration from the skin and transporting it quickly through the the fabric for fast evaporation.Our dress shirts are all American Made.  Every finished shirt is reviewed in detail, ensuring the utmost quality.     
Where are we now? We have perfected our prototype, making sure everything from the button size to collar length are just right and the location and fit of the athletic-wear is both discrete and ideal for maximum flexibility. We have done a sample run of five different styles that will make up the Lawrence Hunt Original Collection: 1) classic white, 2) gray gingham, 3) blue pin-stripe, 4) gray and pink stripe, and 5) blue and yellow plaid.



Our gray and pink stripe shirt with gray moisture-wicking athletic wear


We continue to research fabrics and plan for future product lines.  In the short term, we are planning to expand our staple line to include a slightly more casual, wrinkle-free cotton.  Further, we will add patterns to our athletic-wear so we can mix and match our athletic wear with cotton.  We will have matching cotton and athletic wear, and other patterns that contrast.  Finally, we plan on adding a line of women's professional wear.  After that, the sky is the limit!Where will your funding go?With the funding from Kickstarter, we will:@ $15,000 GoalIncrease productionExpand our collection and sizes

Add a "slim fit" option  Enhance our marketing materialsAfter the campaign, our dress shirt will retail for approximately $110-$120.  Kickstarter is a great chance to get in early.

Blue and Yellow Plaid Lawrence Hunt





Bold blue moisture-wicking athletic-wear


SizingOur prototype/sample run was a Classic/Regular Fit shirt.  If our campaign is successful, we will have a slim fit cut available as an option to backers.  We currently have five basic sizes available (see size chart below).  If our campaign is successful, we will add up to ten sizes, ranging from a 15 collar to 18 collar, to accommodate our backers. After the campaign we will send out a survey to gather your size information. Note that additional delivery time (3-4 weeks) is estimated for those selecting a "slim fit" or additional size.  If your collar/sleeve size is still not available, please contact us at info@lawrencehunt.co and we will discuss pricing options with you.  







Additional sizing if successfully funded


For any questions at all about the campaign, please leave us a comment, or contact us at info@lawrencehunt.coOne last thing:

 We believe in working together and cross-promotion and support. Therefore we have joined the "Kicking It Forward" campaign and will pledge 5% of our final profits from our campaign towards other Kickstarter projects if ours is successful. Note that profits means any funds leftover after the campaign is successful, the development is complete and all other costs have been covered.





Risks and challenges
We have spent over a year working with our manufacturing facility, dealing with our various suppliers, and testing our process from start to finish.  However, depending on the size of our Kickstarter order, we may face challenges to meet our delivery date.  Our manufacturing facility is able to produce up to 500 shirts per run.  Incorporating the lead time to procure the fabrics, a larger than expected order could lead to delays in delivery.  We have included a conservative delivery date to plan for unexpected delays in the supply chain.
In addition, we face a risk that the fabric we are using will not be re-ordered by our supplier when it is out of stock. To mitigate the risk, we have already purchased the fabric for our limited edition shirts, and ensured that the supplier has a significant quantity of fabric on hand for our other patterns.

Recent Press: dbusiness I Seattle Post I San Francisco Gate I Lucky Mag Why we need you?We have created a high-end dress shirt that is perfect for the boardroom or a wedding, but that is also light-weight and breathable to help you stay cool.  

We have perfected the balance between the crisp and professional look of a traditional cotton dress shirt and the performance features of athletic-wear.  Our shirts are ready to go and we now need additional capital to increase our production and expand our marketing efforts.
InspirationWe were tired of feeling uncomfortable in meetings and outdoor weddings.  We wanted a shirt that was light-weight and breathable, but that would also look professional.  To create this perfect dress shirt, we turned to Major League Baseball.  Working with one of the top fashion designers in the country and former lead designer for some of the top brands in America, we applied the concepts from a pitcher's uniform to a men's dress shirt.




 And the Lawrence Hunt Dress Shirt was born...



The original classic white dress shirt


The ShirtWe spent countless hours finding the right fabrics to create a high-end dress shirt that is also flexible, breathable, and moisture-wicking. Our 100% cotton fabrics come from upstate New York, use Egyptian cotton, and are woven and finished in Japan.    Our moisture-wicking athletic-wear comes from Los Angeles.  It is 100% polyester, made from recycled PET bottles, and uses Body Care with Quick Dry function technology.  This keeps the body dry and comfortable by absorbing moisture and perspiration from the skin and transporting it quickly through the the fabric for fast evaporation.Our dress shirts are all American Made.  Every finished shirt is reviewed in detail, ensuring the utmost quality.     
Where are we now? We have perfected our prototype, making sure everything from the button size to collar length are just right and the location and fit of the athletic-wear is both discrete and ideal for maximum flexibility. We have done a sample run of five different styles that will make up the Lawrence Hunt Original Collection: 1) classic white, 2) gray gingham, 3) blue pin-stripe, 4) gray and pink stripe, and 5) blue and yellow plaid.



Our gray and pink stripe shirt with gray moisture-wicking athletic wear


We continue to research fabrics and plan for future product lines.  In the short term, we are planning to expand our staple line to include a slightly more casual, wrinkle-free cotton.  Further, we will add patterns to our athletic-wear so we can mix and match our athletic wear with cotton.  We will have matching cotton and athletic wear, and other patterns that contrast.  Finally, we plan on adding a line of women's professional wear.  After that, the sky is the limit!Where will your funding go?With the funding from Kickstarter, we will:@ $15,000 GoalIncrease productionExpand our collection and sizes

Add a "slim fit" option  Enhance our marketing materialsAfter the campaign, our dress shirt will retail for approximately $110-$120.  Kickstarter is a great chance to get in early.

Blue and Yellow Plaid Lawrence Hunt





Bold blue moisture-wicking athletic-wear


SizingOur prototype/sample run was a Classic/Regular Fit shirt.  If our campaign is successful, we will have a slim fit cut available as an option to backers.  We currently have five basic sizes available (see size chart below).  If our campaign is successful, we will add up to ten sizes, ranging from a 15 collar to 18 collar, to accommodate our backers. After the campaign we will send out a survey to gather your size information. Note that additional delivery time (3-4 weeks) is estimated for those selecting a "slim fit" or additional size.  If your collar/sleeve size is still not available, please contact us at info@lawrencehunt.co and we will discuss pricing options with you.  







Additional sizing if successfully funded


For any questions at all about the campaign, please leave us a comment, or contact us at info@lawrencehunt.coOne last thing:

 We believe in working together and cross-promotion and support. Therefore we have joined the "Kicking It Forward" campaign and will pledge 5% of our final profits from our campaign towards other Kickstarter projects if ours is successful. Note that profits means any funds leftover after the campaign is successful, the development is complete and all other costs have been covered.





Risks and challenges
We have spent over a year working with our manufacturing facility, dealing with our various suppliers, and testing our process from start to finish.  However, depending on the size of our Kickstarter order, we may face challenges to meet our delivery date.  Our manufacturing facility is able to produce up to 500 shirts per run.  Incorporating the lead time to procure the fabrics, a larger than expected order could lead to delays in delivery.  We have included a conservative delivery date to plan for unexpected delays in the supply chain.
In addition, we face a risk that the fabric we are using will not be re-ordered by our supplier when it is out of stock. To mitigate the risk, we have already purchased the fabric for our limited edition shirts, and ensured that the supplier has a significant quantity of fabric on hand for our other patterns.

Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

About Us








Our Story

Clothing should be comfortable and make you feel confident. 
Lawrence Hunt, a "professional performance" clothing brand, launched in December 2015, was founded because we believed that the dress shirt needed to be improved. It was uncomfortable and a pain to wear. A shirt worn as often as the dress shirt, whether at the office or to a formal occasion should be as comfortable, functional and stylish as a shirt worn on the golf course. It should look good, move/stretch, breathe, and you shouldn't have to worry about embarrassing sweat stains when you lift up your arms.
You should not have to compromise style for comfort, or vice versa. Lawrence Hunt believes you can have both. The Lawrence Hunt shirt is the first to combine two distinct fabrics into one article of clothing to take advantage of the benefits of both fabrics.
Lawrence Hunt's initial beta white men's dress shirt has grown into complete apparel lines for both men and women. Lawrence Hunt clothing applies the same concepts and technologies used to make an athlete's uniform breathable, comfortable and resistant to sweat stains to its complete line of dress shirts.
