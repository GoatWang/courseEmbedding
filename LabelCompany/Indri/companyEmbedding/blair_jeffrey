This sure-hold gel-lacquer freezes shapes with a sculpted, glistening finish – no movement, no brush-outs – it’s in until you wash it out.


26.00






styling wax
A little gives separation to any cut, and a lot gives sleek grooming with soft, malleable hold (any amount adds shine).


23.00






sumowax
A traditional hard wax for modern cuts – strong (yet flexible) hold, textural effect and definition of detail – it disciplines heavyweights, yet won’t overwhelm finer types.


27.00






sumotech
It’s not a wax, not a paste and not a creme, but a midweight moulding compound that’s a combination of all three (and a miracle of modern technology).
