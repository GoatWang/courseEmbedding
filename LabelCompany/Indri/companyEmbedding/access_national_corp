ANCX: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 04/13/2017 settlement date, and Access National Corp is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 6.94 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.14. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
