Unsecured Personal Loans

Unsecured vs. Secured

FAQ

Articles













What is a unsecured loan?
A unsecured loan is issued based on the borrower's creditworthiness, instead of some type of collateral. An unsecured loan can be obtained without the use of property as collateral for processing the loan. Borrowers generally must have high credit ratings to be approved for an unsecured loan.

 




Unsecured loans, also called personal loans or signature loans, involve borrowing money without putting up any collateral. Because there is no home or car to repossess if you don't make your payments, these loans are considerably riskier for lenders. Extra risk means lenders must charge higher interest rates and require higher credit scores.
Unsecured personal loans involve much less paperwork than secured loans like mortgages, but more than products like payday advances. The terms are generally shorter, from two to five years, and loan amounts are usually smaller. Unsecured loans can be used for almost anything -- like debt consolidation, college tuition, medical bills, a business loan or the trip of a lifetime.
It's not easy to get approved for an unsecured loan with bad credit, and the rates for these loans are quite high. However, some lenders might offer you a better deal if you have a co-signer.

 
Who Should Consider A Unsecured Personal Loan?
Consumers who need money quickly should consider an unsecured personal loan. What makes a unsecured loan unique is that no collateral is required -- the loan is guaranteed only by the borrower's promise to pay. These loans might be the only option for people who don't own homes or have sufficient equity to borrow against their homes. Loan proceeds can be used for almost anything:

 Debt consolidation
 College tuition
 Home Improvements
 Down payments on property
 Business expenses
 Vehicles

 

Advantages of Unsecured Loans
For those who need money quickly, it can be much faster to apply for a unsecured loan than to sell assets to get the needed cash -- and borrowers can always sell their assets later and use the proceeds to pay off the loan. If the choices are withdrawing from a retirement account (racking up taxes and penalties) or applying for an unsecured loan, the loan is likely to be the cheaper alternative. Unlike credit cards, fixed-rate loans come with interest rates that don't change, and there is no "default rate" for being late with a payment. If the consumer experiences a financial disaster at a later date, the unsecured loan can be discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, unlike secured loans or government-backed student loans.
 

How to Apply for a Unsecured Personal Loan
Because the loan is not backed by anything other than the borrower's promise to repay, an applicant's credit history and scores are very important. Applicants for unsecured loans must complete an application, authorize a credit check, and provide documentation showing that they have sufficient income to repay the new loan -- usually pay stubs and W-2 forms, or tax returns for the self-employed. Underwriting is completed by automated systems and human underwriters, and the applicant is notified in writing of the decision to approve or decline the loan. In many cases, consumers can apply online and have the money transferred directly into their bank accounts without leaving their homes.
 

Shopping for Unsecured Loans
Unsecured personal loans can be obtained from banks, credit unions, finance companies, P2P lenders and others. Interest rates for these loans vary widely, so it makes sense to get quotes from several competing lenders before making any commitments. When shopping for the best unsecured personal loan, consumers should compare the interest rate, fees and APR. They should look for prepayment penalties and automatic rollovers and double check the loan's term and payment before signing.
 

Borrower Beware!
One requirement of most lenders is good credit -- applicants with a history of missed payments, collections and charge-offs aren't the most promising candidates for unsecured financing. There are reputable providers of personal unsecured loans online for people with credit scores under 600, and other lenders are sometimes willing to fund loans to sub-prime applicants if they have a cosigner.
However, the Internet is also full of shady firms ready to exploit desperate people. Those seeking an loan should watch out for lenders advertising personal loans for bad credit or unsecured loans with no credit check -- these are not really personal loans. They are really payday loans, check advance loans or title loans -- with very short terms and very high interest rates.
 

Unsecured Personal Loan Interest Rates and Terms
Terms typically range from two to five years. The borrower receives a lump sum and repays the loan with equal monthly installments. Unsecured loan interest rates are usually fixed. However, there are also revolving lines of credit, which function like credit cards. Borrowers set them up and draw on them as needed, paying interest only on the amounts used. The monthly payment is based on the loan balance and interest rate, which is variable.
Interest rates on unsecured loans (the legitimate kind) vary according to the lender's policies and the credit ratings of the borrowers. In 2014, rates for loans range from 6-7 percent at the low end to about 40 percent at the high end.










Unsecured vs Secured Personal Loans
Loans fall into two categories – unsecured or secured. There are benefits and drawbacks to both, but the biggest difference lies in whether the loan requires collateral.



Unsecured Personal Loans

 Does not require putting property or assets up as collateral - collateral is an item or items put up as security for the loan, meaning it can be seized if you default on the loan
 Often requires higher credit and has higher interest rates while offering lower borrowing limits
 Getting an unsecured loan is mostly based on your creditworthiness
 Types of unsecured loans include most personal loans, student loans, and credit cards



Secured Personal Loans

 Requires putting up property or assets up as collateral, which may be seized if you default on the loan. The asset you are taking the loan for is often the collateral for the loan - for example, if you are getting a mortgage, the house you are buying is the collateral
 Offers higher loan limits and are easier to get than unsecured loans because the lender takes on less risk if you default
 If you cannot get an unsecured loan, it may be easier to be approved for a secured loan with collateral
 Types of secured loans include car loans, mortgages and HELOC

Payday Loans Approved In 2 Minutes
Everybody experiences a short fall between paychecks.  It is often difficult to ask for help, let alone find it.  We have one simple goal: solving
            your short term cash needs as securely, discreetly, and as quickly as possible.  Our service consists of a large, 100+ lender network.  We can typically match most applicants with a loan.
How it Works
Our service is completely free and all repayment terms are between you and the lender. Each lender has different loan terms, such as the loan amount, the APR for the loan, repayment schedules, etc.
At QuickerCash.com, we understand you need help, and you need it quickly.  Getting the money you 
            deserve should be simple and painless.  This is actually how we have designed our process.
First, complete our no-obligation 5-minute application.  It is simple and straight forward:
	          we only ask you for information we need to approve your loan.  Your information is also secure as we use the latest 
	          technology in website encryption.  Immediately after you submit your application, we can 
	          match you with a lender.  If your not matched, we will tell you.
Upon approval with a third party lender, you will be presented with a loan offer.  This will be a detailed document explaining your loan 
	          with complete rate and fee disclosure.  If everything looks good, you can accept the loan offer using your 
	          e-signature.  If the loan offer does not satisfy your needs, simply decline.  There is never any obligation to 
	          accept the loan!  You can also exit the process at any time and feel comfortable your information is safe.
If you choose to accept the loan offered, your funds will automatically be deposited into your bank account. The latest you will receive your funds is usually one business day.
How Much Does it Cost?
The lenders in our lending network may offer you a loan with an APR between: 22.9% and 1304%
The APR on a small dollar, short term loan represents the amount of your loan, cost of the loan, term of the loan and repayment amounts and timing.  Loans on the lower end of the APR range may be for a larger loan amount and for a longer term.  Loans on the higher end of the APR range may be for a smaller loan amount and for a shorter term.  Depending on your credit needs, and desire to pay your loan off quickly, your lender may only offer you loans with an APR near the high end of the range displayed. 
NOTICE: THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE FORM OF CREDIT. A SHORT TERM LOAN SHOULD BE USED FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL NEEDS ONLY, NOT AS A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL SOLUTION.  CUSTOMERS WITH CREDIT DIFFICULTIES SHOULD SEEK CREDIT COUNSELING OR MEET WITH A NONPROFIT FINANCIAL COUNSELING SERVICE IN THEIR COMMUNITY.
What Happens if I Don't Pay My Loan According to its Terms?
If you do not pay your loan according to its terms, your lender may: Charge you late fees, Send your account to a collection agency, Report your information to a consumer reporting agency which may negatively affect your credit score, or offer to extend your loan which may cause you to incur additional fees, charges and interest.
We are not a lender.  Only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms and APR and the implications for non-payment of your loan.  Ask your lender for their current rates and charges and their policies for non-payment.

How it Works
QuickerCash.com is a lending network, NOT a lender. Our service is completely free and all repayment terms are between you and the lender. Each lender has different loan terms, such as the loan amount, the APR for the loan, repayment schedules, etc.
At QuickerCash.com, we understand you need help, and you need it quickly.  Getting the money you 
            deserve should be simple and painless.  This is actually how we have designed our process.
First, complete our no-obligation 5-minute application.  It is simple and straight forward:
	          we only ask you for information we need to approve your loan.  Your information is also secure as we use the latest 
	          technology in website encryption.  Immediately after you submit your application, we can 
	          match you with a lender.  If your not matched, we will tell you.
Upon approval with a third party lender, you will be presented with a loan offer.  This will be a detailed document explaining your loan 
	          with complete rate and fee disclosure.  If everything looks good, you can accept the loan offer using your 
	          e-signature.  If the loan offer does not satisfy your needs, simply decline.  There is never any obligation to 
	          accept the loan!  You can also exit the process at any time and feel comfortable your information is safe.
Receiving Your Loan
If you choose to accept the loan offered, your funds will automatically be deposited into your bank account
			      you have listed with us in as little as one hour.  The latest you will receive your funds is usually one business day.
Paying Back Your Loan
The loan offer will show you your loan payback date, and the ways in which you can pay it off.  Typically
		        our customers choose to have it conveniently withdrawn from the bank account the loan was initially deposited into.

Rates & Terms
Submitting your inquiry for a loan at QuickerCash.com incurs absolutely no cost. QuickerCash.com is not a lender and does not provide lending services directly to consumers. Based on the information you submit, QuickerCash.com searches its database housing its vast network of lenders to pair you with the lender and loan that may be suited to your needs so that you can submit an application directly to the lender.
The Truth in Lending Act requires full disclosure of all loan fees and interest rates that borrowers may incur. All fees and rate information should be disclosed to you by your lender at the time of approval. Upon the conclusion of lender approval, most lenders will direct you to an e-signature page. This page is provided to you by the lender to which you were matched.
Full Disclosure of Terms
The lender provides documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan being offered to you by the lender. Please review the fee and rate information provided to you by your lender at this time thoroughly and completely before agreeing to the terms of the loan. You are under no obligation to accept these terms. If you decide the loan terms detailed in the lender contract are acceptable and wish to proceed with the loan process, e-sign the page and await transfer of your funds.
The loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by your lender, with specific amounts determined based upon the information you submitted to the lender. QuickerCash.com has no control or knowledge of the loan details between you and your lender. You are under no obligation to continue with the application process if you find a particular lender’s loan terms unsuitable.
Late Payment Policy
Cash advance lenders have varying policies regarding late payments. Review the late payment policy detailed in the loan documents provided to you by your lender before appending your e-signature, and thereby agreeing to the loan terms. All lenders, however, must abide by applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding late payment fees.
Non-Payment Policy
Additional fees or charges may apply to you in the event that you are unable to repay your loan. QuickerCash.com uses commercially reasonable efforts to work only with reputable lenders dedicated to pursuing collections of past due accounts with conduct that is fair and reasonable.
Loan Renewal Policy
Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. In states where rollovers, or repayment term extensions, are allowed, interest rates, along with any late fees that may be assessed, can add a substantial dollar amount to the end price of your loan. Find your state’s laws and regulations governing rollovers and extensions from among the list down below. Read the lender’s terms in full regarding loan renewal options before signing the loan contract.
State Rate & Fee Regulations
Find your state to review the applicable laws and regulations governing cash advance loan rates and fees in your state.
Our Lending Policy
QuickerCash.com's lenders adhere to strict lending standards.  Please see our Lending Policy for more details.

What is a Reverse Mortgage?
A reverse mortgage allows homeowners 62 years of age or older to use the equity in their homes to eliminate their monthly mortgage payment and/or supplement their income. Unlike a conventional mortgage where a homeowner increases their equity by making a payment each month, ultimately paying off the loan at the end of the term (e.g. 30 years), the homeowner on a reverse mortgage makes no payment. Instead, you receive payments from a lender, allowing you to supplement your income.

Our story
Aldo Piscitello, born in 1952, immigrated to the United States from Naples, Italy in 1969. Upon his arrival to his first residence in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, he noticed a milkman stepping over a bike, a skateboard, and an array of toys left on the front porch. Aldo watched as the milkman opened a small silver box, took out a ten dollar bill, and placed 2 milk bottles and the change back into the box. A sense of trust came over him as he realized how great it felt to be in a safe and trusting community. Being in America was truly a blessing and a dream come true. Aldo, believing and trusting this new land, wanted to pursue the American Dream. At the age of 18, he built up the courage to apply for a loan to finance his first American venture-a paper route. He borrowed his first $500 on a handshake and a signature.The loan office told him, “Be responsible, and I will be there if you need more money to build your business.” “You have my word,” Aldo replied. Aldo then developed a professional relationship with the local bank, securing many loans. Through his hard work, Aldo developed a reputation of trust and integrity. As a successful entrepreneur, he founded and developed numerous successful businesses in various industries, including the internet industry. 
Over the years, Aldo watched as local banks lost its personal banking interactions. It became obvious to him that large financial firms were headed a grim direction. Aldo’s prediction lead to the concept and development of BorrowMoney.com.  In 2010, Aldo began utilizing the company’s most valuable asset – its name. Fortunately, BorrowMoney.com was already in his possession since 1987. 
Swiftly seizing this business opportunity, Aldo hired a team of skilled IT personnel to create and cultivate a database comprising of every mortgage broker, lender, bank, and lending institution- including real estate brokers and salespeople – in the United States. This was used to implement the Local Lending Local Rewards business model, Since he founded the company in 2010, Aldo has served as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director. All his time and energy has been dedicated to developing and advancing BorrownMoney.com. His responsibilities include securing and patenting the company name, developing the programs and platforms, marketing the products and services, as well as overseeing the everyday operations of the business.

Search Realestate and Rental Listings!


The largest investment most people make in their lifetime is their house. A house, besides being a place of refuge from the outside world, has proven to be an excellent long-term investment. But, it’s important to be knowledgeable so that you make a wise decision. Buying real estate is a complex process and it’s important to seek professional advice throughout the process even if you’re a seasoned professional.  Below are key people you should include in your real estate search:

An agent provides property listings that fit your parameters saving you time and gas money. They know what properties are available but not yet listed as well as who is motivated to sell. They have in depth information about the neighborhood and community and are often privy to inside information like highways being built which can affect the sale or re-sale price.
A mortgage broker or banker is essential to understanding how much          house you can afford before the search is started. It’s also important to get pre-approved for a mortgage because most sellers won’t consider offers from prospective buyers without it. Also, the purchase price cannot be more than what the property is appraised for.
A home inspector is crucial to knowing the real condition of the property and not just the things you can see. The inspector will inspect all aspects of the house including the electrical, heating and plumbing systems, structure, safety features, landscaping and other issues that you should know about. Most states allow buyers to void the contract of sale if significant repairs are required.
A lawyer can make sense of the sales contract and closing documents for you so that you understand everything about the transaction before closing. It’s his/her job to protect your rights and interests in the deal.
A home insurance agent will insure that you get adequate coverage and can advise you of any potential hazards (like flooding) that may exist requiring special or additional coverage. You must have home insurance coverage to buy a house.

Borrow Money has everything you need to find that perfect house or property, finance it, and protect it. We give you the resources to make your real estate experience great.

3. MORTGAGE LOAN REQUEST SERVICES
The BorrowMoney process occurs when you complete a form for a loan request and get matched with Lenders who will reply and respond with conditional loan offers.
A. Terms Applicable to All Mortgage Loan Request Services
BorrowMoney is a computerized loan originator for mortgage loans and performs computerized loan origination services for Lenders and is compensated for such services by the Lenders. Lenders are not to directly charge you any computerized loan fee and the fee should appear on your settlement statement. Depending on the Lender, the computerized loan origination fee paid by the Lender may be included in your rate, points or loan terms. Although some state licensing laws treat fees paid in exchange for computerized loan origination services as mortgage broker fees or origination fees may not be the case under federal law. BorrowMoney is not a lender nor is acting as a lender or broker and does not make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans. BorrowMoney does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular Lender. Except as otherwise provided for your state (please see the Licenses and Disclosures section of the Website), BorrowMoney is not an agent of you or any Lender. BorrowMoney's services are only administrative. You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms and Lender best suits your needs and financial means. The Lender is solely responsible for its services to you, and you agree that BorrowMoney will not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of such services. You understand that Lenders may keep your loan request information and any other information provided by BorrowMoney or received by them in the processing of your loan request, whether or not you are qualified for a loan with them or if you make a loan with them. You agree to notify any particular Lender directly if you no longer want to receive communications from them.
The Website and the services provided by BorrowMoney are available in connection with mortgage loans made on real property located in the fifty states and the District of Columbia unless otherwise specified. Loans may only be made to residents of, or secured by real property located in, states where Lenders are licensed or authorized to make such loans. Lenders are not attempting to make loans outside of their authorized states by participating in and offering their products on the Website. BorrowMoney Lenders expressly reserve the right to discontinue, suspend or terminate the offering of any loan product in any specific state through the Website at any time, without prior notice.
The data and other information you may provide BorrowMoney is not, and is not treated as, an application for a loan or a request to be pre-approved, pre-qualified or any similar concept. BorrowMoney does not guarantee acceptance into any particular loan program or specific loan terms or conditions with any Lender; loan approval standards are established and maintained solely by individual Lenders. Likewise, BorrowMoney does not guarantee that the loan terms or rates offered and made available by Lenders are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. A Lender's offer may be subject to market conditions, approval and qualification. The rates and fees actually provided by Lenders may be higher or lower depending on your complete credit profile, collateral/property considerations including but not limited to location, equity and value and income/asset consideration including but not limited to loan to value and debt to income ratios. Unless expressly stated in writing, nothing contained herein shall constitute an offer or promise for a loan commitment or interest rate lock-in agreement. Lenders may not offer all products as well as not offer products in all states. You might not be matched with the Lender making any specific offer. To help the government fight identity theft, the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify your identity, BorrowMoney and its Lenders may obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account with us and them.

15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of the Website, to the goods or services provided by BorrowMoney, or to any acts or omissions for which you may contend BorrowMoney is liable, including but not limited to any claim or controversy as to arbitrability ("Dispute"), shall be finally, and exclusively, settled by arbitration. The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator under the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") dated September 15, 2005. The arbitration shall be venued in consumer location reasonably convenient to the consumer. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the AAA rules. Should no AAA rule regarding the selection of an arbitrator be in effect, the parties shall agree on an arbitrator mutually agreeable to both parties. Should the AAA decline to accept a matter submitted for individual (non-class) arbitration under these Terms of Use, the parties shall jointly select another arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to agree on a neutral arbitrator, the claimant may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction solely for the purpose of requesting the appointment of an arbitrator for individual (non-class) arbitration, as provided for in Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act.To begin the arbitration process, a party must make a written demand therefor.
Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The agreement to arbitrate shall not be construed as an agreement to the joinder or consolidation of an arbitration under this agreement with an arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues or disputes involved. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND BORROWMONEY WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU THUS GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing, and the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. By using BorrowMoney's goods, facilities and services, you consent to these restrictions.
Should a Dispute arise and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit between you and BorrowMoney, the parties agree that jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in Kings County, New York. If either party employs attorneys to enforce any right in connection with any Dispute or lawsuit, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees.

A Dozen Ways To Borrow Money


To get bankers to open their pockets, you have to know their language. Here's a primer on the ways banks lend money.






By Joan G. Ford













WRITE A COMMENT



















CREDIT: 










Bankers, even those who are hot on the trail of new clients, play by some pretty conservative rules.  They may take you to lunch, tour your offices, peruse your financials enthusiastically, and then turn down a loan request for reasons that seem absurdly technical.In fact, banks want to lend money.  It's the main product they have to sell, and small business is repidly becoming one of banking's most attractive customers (see "Special Report, Banking in the '80s," INC., November).  But lending officers aren't standing at the door counting out bills.  They still have to cope with both federal and state banking regulations, traditional lending standards, and a persistent desire to keep the funds they lend from straying beyond their control.The starting point to overcoming these obstacles, most lending officers agree, is to put together a proposal that fits into the conventional categories the banking world uses to describe most loans.  There will still be countless variations on these categories, as well as individual terms and conditions to deal with for each borrower.  But at least you'll be speaking a language your banker respects -- and that can't hurt.Here then are the 12 basic loan categories that bankers generally use to classify loans, grouped according to the expected duration of the loan.SHORT-TERM LOANSBusiness runs on short-term loans.  Technically a "short term" loan means less than a year, but in practice often expands to two or three years.  Small companies usually seek short-term loans to finance receivables or inventory, especially in seasonal or perishable lines.  But short-term loans can also be turned to many other purposes, from taking advantage of an inventory bargain to taking care of an emergency.Most short-term loans fall into one of five classes:* LINE OF CREDIT.  A widely used mode of short-term lending, a line of credit consists of a specific sum marked off for a company to draw on, as needed, over a prescribed period.  The period may run only 30 days, or may stretch to two years, since repayment is tied to anticipated receipts.  Interest is computed only on the amount actually drawn, but a commitment fee of 1/2% to 1% of the total credit line is usually imposed, to pay the bank for reserving funds that may not be tapped.  Some banks waive the fee in favor of a compensating balance, a sum that must be kept on deposit throughout the loan period; others work out a combination of compensating balances and commitment fees.Lines of credit are popular because of their simplicity, but banks have developed several credit line arrangements that fit different borrowing needs. The cheapest, the nonbinding line of credit, may be your best buy if you're willing to risk the line's drying up.  With no guarantees, your credit may be curtailed if your company's financial position deteriorates, or even if your industry seems healed for hard times.  Moreover, when the economy is tight -- and your need is greatest -- the bank may develop liquidity problems that force a cut-off, although the larger money-center institutions can usually ride out such crises.The risks of losing the line can be avoided by paying a premium to insert the word "committed" in the loan agreement.  The commitment fee will probably double, going as high as 2%, but you're assured that the funds will be there when you need them.Nonbinding or committed, a short-term line of credit must be "cleaned up" periodically, under most banks' rules.  You must be "out of the bank," or fully paid up, for 30 days a year, in the typical agreement.If cleaning up a line of credit will constrict your cash flow, there's a third form that may be useful -- the revolving line of credit, which requires an annual review and renewal but no cleanup.  This is similar to a revolving charge account: As you withdraw funds, your available credit diminishes, and as you repay, it expands by a like amount.  Interest is computed only on the funds actually borrowed, and there's usually no additional cost.Ordinarily, revolving lines are repaid in monthly installments of interest plus principal, but some banks offer other options.At Citibank in New York, for example, you can arrange to restrict some installments to interest, holding off on payments of principal until your cash flow improves.* INVENTORY LOAN.  When a small company with seasonal borrowing needs comes in for a loan of $25,000 to $200,000, some big banks shy away from the formal line of credit, preferring to write what they may call "short-term loans to carry inventory." The bank's collateral is the inventory itself -- sometimes, under an arrangement called "floor planning" that big-ticket retailers use, loans are collateralized by specific inventory items -- so your banker is likely to feel in control of the situation.  From the customer's point of view, however, an inventory loan might just as well be a line of credit.  Funds are made available to be "taken down," or borrowed, as needed; repayment is made in installments as inventory is sold and receivables satisfied.The usual inventory loan runs six to nine months, and requires the same 30-day annual cleanup as a line of credit, if you want an extension.* COMMERCIAL LOAN.  Some big banks funnel much of their short-term lending into commercial, or "time," loans which minimize bookkeeping for both lender and borrower.  Requiring no installments, a commercial loan is simply repaid in a lump sum at the end of the term, typically three to six months.  In practice, commercial loans are often used to finance inventory, but they may be applied to any other purpose that wins bank approval.  In making a commercial loan the bank's chief concern, in addition to the company's credit rating, is the source of repayment: How will the company amass the lump sum to meet its obligation?* ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING.  Small companies in almost every industry today find receivables are tying up inordinate amounts of working capital, so they're turning to their banks for loans that will convert unpaid accounts into fast cash.Which accounts, and how much?Generally, accounts must be less than 60 days past due, and the customers themselves must qualify as creditworthy.  For receivables meeting these criteria, banks will advance 65% to 80% of face value, repayable as customers' checks come in.  The usual arrangement calls for you to pass the checks on to the bank, which takes its portion and deposits the rest in your account, charging interest only on the amount outstanding.Although the contract is ordinarily written for one year, many banks are prepared to work out a revolving format.  Under such an agreement, which is subject to annual review and renewal, they will continue to advance funds against your incoming receivables.  One limitation on receivables financing that doesn't apply to other short-term loans is that most banks set minimums based on the cost of monitoring such loans.  At the Southeast First National Bank of Miami, for example, qualified receivables must amount to at least $250,000, which translates into annual sales of at least $2.5 million.* FACTORING.  Perhaps the oldest method of commercial lending, factoring is a variation of accounts receivable financing in which the bank (or a factoring company) buys receivables outright.  A couple of decades ago, factoring was largely restricted to the apparel and textiles industries, and was disdained in other quarters.  Today, many more industries draw on factoring services.  In addition to textiles, major users include the electronics, importing, wood and wood products, plastics, home furnishings, and appliance industries.Since receivables are purchased without recourse, ordinarily you're no longer involved once the transaction is completed.  The bank assumes credit risks and takes on collection responsibilities, receiving payments directly from your customers.  But if you don't want your customers.  But if you don't want your customers to know you're involved in a factoring arrangement, you have other options.  Some banks offer "non-notification" factoring, in which you continue to collect payments on the purchased receivables, and forward them to the new owner.There are some limits to factoring.  The bank subjects receivables to rigid scrutiny before making any purchases, to screen out the poorest risks.  Further, your costs, in the form of discounts from face value, may be quite high; often, in fact, they are higher than in most other forms of short-term financing.MEDIUM-TERM LOANSShort-term loans tend to be granted by banks without too much concern for collateral since these loans are usually self-liquidating from sales made in the ordinary course of business operations.  More likely to require collateral are medium-term loans, of one to five years, which are the usual way to finance machinery and equipment, including furniture and fixtures, plant alteration, and expansion.  While you may view the asset you're purchasing as security, don't be surprised if the bank doesn't see it that way and asks for additional collateral, particularly if you're starting a new company.  The bank will, however, expect the asset to serve as the source of repayment, in terms of generating increased revenues.There are two kinds of medium-term loans:* TERM LOAN.  Most term loans providing 80% to 90% of total costs are written either for five years, with a refinancing clause, or for the useful life of the asset.  The typical repayment schedule calls for quarterly installments of principal plus interest.  Principal payments remain constant, but interest, computed on the amount outstanding, declines over the term of the loan.  In consequence, installments are highest at the start, although you can often arrange to tailor the repayment schedule to meet your anticipated cash flow.* MONTHLY PAYMENT BUSINESS LOAN.  Even with this deferral, the quarterly installments may prove initially burdensome.  Accordingly, some banks offer a variation permitting you to make approximately equal monthly payments over the entire period.  At Union Trust in New Haven, Conn., for example, you can work out a schedule, tailored to your company's needs, that will allow you to repay a much smaller amount in the first year or two than would be demanded by term-loan conditions.  Toward the end of the loan period, though, you'll be paying more, under the monthly payment plan.  While these payments remain the same, the quarterly term-loan installments decrease, as interest drops along with principal owed.Many companies find the reduced early payments advantageous, but whichever method of repayment suits you better, you should be aware that medium-term loans, in contrast to short-term loans, may impose operating restrictions on your company.  The bank may insist on your maintaining a certain level of working capital or current ratio (current assets/current liabilities); or limits may be enforced on the distribution of dividends or on other debt.  If you don't like the conditions laid down by one bank, however, try another; you're sure to find differences.LONG-TERM LOANSLoans of five or more years, least often sought and probably the hardest to get, will be linked to specific business purposes.  The most common include purchase of real property, major expansion, acquisitions, and start-ups.* COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL MORTGAGES.  Banks ask sharp questions about potential real estate purchases because, as a Bank of America lending officer cautions, "Pride of ownership can mean business failure." Nevertheless, if you get the chance to buy the building you're now renting, most banks will consider a mortgage loan of up to 75% of appraised value.  Commercial and industrial mortgages may be written in a variety of ways, depending on the value of the building, your company's long-range profit projections, and the bank's lending policies.  Under the best circumstances, you might get a 25-year mortgage, to be paid off in regular monthly installments.  More likely, though, you'll have to settle for a mortgage of 5 to 10 years, but your monthly payments probably won't reflect this short period.  Rather, they'll be geared to a 15- or 20-year amortization period.When the mortgage comes due, you'll be faced with a "balloon" payment of the entire amount still owed.  Many companies manage to refinance at this point, but a new loan won't be guaranteed.* REAL ESTATE LOAN.  Many companies face just the opposite problem: They already own real estate, and want to borrow against its value to finance an acquisition or other form of expansion.  You can tap this equity, without giving up a low-interest first mortgage, by adding a second mortgage -- if you have sufficient equity and good financial standing.  If you're in a less solid position, a "wrap-around" mortgage could be an alternative.  This differs from a second mortgage in one detail: The bank tightens its control by receiving all your mortgage payments, and then passing on the amount due to the holder of the first mortgage.If your mortgaged property has appreciated substantially, you might consider refinancing.  You can probably get a new mortgage based on current value, but you'll have to give up your old interest rate and take on today's higher rate. Your banker may try to discourage you from refinancing -- unless you're certain you can turn the cash you get into long-term profits.* PERSONAL LOAN.  Most bankers believe an owner's personal assets should provide much of the financing for major expansion and acquisition, so you may have to think about including a secured personal loan in your long-term financing plans.  Any property in your own name can be used as collateral, along with marketable securities, savings passbooks, and certificates of deposit. Such collateral is readily acceptable, and a personal loan may be easier to negotiate than a business loan.To help you put the proceeds to most productive use, the bank may recommend a sophisticated leveraging technique.  For example, you may be advised to turn the funds over to your company as a "subordinated loan," repayable to you only after other company debt is discharged.  While this kind of loan doesn't create real equity, it will appear on your balance sheet as "surplus capital," a source of leveraging further loans up to three times the amount of the surplus.* ASSET-BASED LOAN.  Long used by big corporations, but new to the repertory of small companies, is the leveraged buy-out, in which the target company's own assets are used to finance the takeover.  Virtually every asset can be used -- receivables, raw materials, inventory, machinery, and equipment.  Under the most favorable conditions, a combination of these assets may generate as much as 70% of the acquisition cost.  But you'll be charged the prime, or "base rate," as some banks are starting to call this benchmark figure, plus 2% or 3%.  Moreover, the bank is likely to insist on various operating restrictions as well as keep close tabs on the assets.  But once again, not all banks make the same demands, so you can shop around for the best deal.* START-UP LOAN.  Starting up parallels expansion and acquisition, in the banks' view, which means that you'll have to pour much of your own money into the project.  In addition to funds raised by personal loans and partners' investments, you may be able to get a term loan from the bank's venture capital specialists, though a Small Business Administration guarantee, which protects 90% of the total, is frequently a condition.  This procedure can involve a fair amount of paperwork and delay, unless your bank participates in the SBA's Certification Program; about 500 of the nation's approximately 14,100 commercial banks participate.

Company Description
BorrowMoney.com, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on January 27,
2000, originally known as Sports.com, Inc. Since its inception and up until May
4, 2015, the Company has undergone several name changes, the last being
BorrowMoney.com, Inc. On May 4, 2015, the Company became


 BorrowMoney.com, Inc.
Simultaneously, it completed a share exchange with all of the shareholders of
BorrowMoney.com, Inc., a New York corporation where 100% of the issued and
outstanding shares of the New York Corporation were exchanged for shares in the
Florida Corporation which resulted in Borrowmoney.com, Inc., the New York
Corporation becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Florida Corporation.

The Company has created an Internet-based loan marketplace for consumers and our
customers, which are lenders. Our technology is now operational and we are able
to collect consumer credit requests and compare those requests and related
credit information for submission to lenders which have joined our technology
platform. We are not a lender. We currently can intake consumer applications and
inquiries for submission to participating lenders who receive consumer credit
requests that are received online from consumers. We have minimal revenues and
must have additional lenders join our marketplace to generate significant
revenues. As more lenders join our network within a consumer’s geographic areas
within the United States, consumers will receive up to three (3) offers in
response to a single credit request and then be able to compare, review, and
accept the offer that best suits their needs. Lenders can generate new business
that meets their specific underwriting criteria at a cost that is lower than the
costs associated with off-line loan originations. Our marketplace encompasses
most consumer credit categories, including mortgages, home equity loans,
automobile loans, and personal loans. We have an additional category for
submissions to lenders for business loans. We recently added capabilities to our
technology and proprietary Internet platform which assists a consumer in finding
a realtor within the geographic area that the consumer is attempting to either
purchase or sell real property.

BorrowMoney.com, Inc.’s main objective is to provide a service for the internet
mortgage and loan provider business. BorrowMoney.com, Inc.’s business model
envisions providing current, qualified leads to local lending institutions who
are currently members of the National Mortgage Listing Service. These leads will
represent qualified borrowers in targeted zip code locations where the lender
conducts business. Our internet platform offers a portal geared toward providing
services to lending institutions who would be our customers. The key function of
our platform is to provide qualified leads to local mortgage and lending
professionals. The Company monetizes customer inquiries through the use of
various advertising methods. The Company sells advertising space on its website
and creates revenue through the sale of advertisement space, membership fees and
lead packages.

Unsecured Personal Loans

Unsecured vs. Secured

FAQ

Articles













What is a unsecured loan?
A unsecured loan is issued based on the borrower's creditworthiness, instead of some type of collateral. An unsecured loan can be obtained without the use of property as collateral for processing the loan. Borrowers generally must have high credit ratings to be approved for an unsecured loan.

 




Unsecured loans, also called personal loans or signature loans, involve borrowing money without putting up any collateral. Because there is no home or car to repossess if you don't make your payments, these loans are considerably riskier for lenders. Extra risk means lenders must charge higher interest rates and require higher credit scores.
Unsecured personal loans involve much less paperwork than secured loans like mortgages, but more than products like payday advances. The terms are generally shorter, from two to five years, and loan amounts are usually smaller. Unsecured loans can be used for almost anything -- like debt consolidation, college tuition, medical bills, a business loan or the trip of a lifetime.
It's not easy to get approved for an unsecured loan with bad credit, and the rates for these loans are quite high. However, some lenders might offer you a better deal if you have a co-signer.

 
Who Should Consider A Unsecured Personal Loan?
Consumers who need money quickly should consider an unsecured personal loan. What makes a unsecured loan unique is that no collateral is required -- the loan is guaranteed only by the borrower's promise to pay. These loans might be the only option for people who don't own homes or have sufficient equity to borrow against their homes. Loan proceeds can be used for almost anything:

 Debt consolidation
 College tuition
 Home Improvements
 Down payments on property
 Business expenses
 Vehicles

 

Advantages of Unsecured Loans
For those who need money quickly, it can be much faster to apply for a unsecured loan than to sell assets to get the needed cash -- and borrowers can always sell their assets later and use the proceeds to pay off the loan. If the choices are withdrawing from a retirement account (racking up taxes and penalties) or applying for an unsecured loan, the loan is likely to be the cheaper alternative. Unlike credit cards, fixed-rate loans come with interest rates that don't change, and there is no "default rate" for being late with a payment. If the consumer experiences a financial disaster at a later date, the unsecured loan can be discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, unlike secured loans or government-backed student loans.
 

How to Apply for a Unsecured Personal Loan
Because the loan is not backed by anything other than the borrower's promise to repay, an applicant's credit history and scores are very important. Applicants for unsecured loans must complete an application, authorize a credit check, and provide documentation showing that they have sufficient income to repay the new loan -- usually pay stubs and W-2 forms, or tax returns for the self-employed. Underwriting is completed by automated systems and human underwriters, and the applicant is notified in writing of the decision to approve or decline the loan. In many cases, consumers can apply online and have the money transferred directly into their bank accounts without leaving their homes.
 

Shopping for Unsecured Loans
Unsecured personal loans can be obtained from banks, credit unions, finance companies, P2P lenders and others. Interest rates for these loans vary widely, so it makes sense to get quotes from several competing lenders before making any commitments. When shopping for the best unsecured personal loan, consumers should compare the interest rate, fees and APR. They should look for prepayment penalties and automatic rollovers and double check the loan's term and payment before signing.
 

Borrower Beware!
One requirement of most lenders is good credit -- applicants with a history of missed payments, collections and charge-offs aren't the most promising candidates for unsecured financing. There are reputable providers of personal unsecured loans online for people with credit scores under 600, and other lenders are sometimes willing to fund loans to sub-prime applicants if they have a cosigner.
However, the Internet is also full of shady firms ready to exploit desperate people. Those seeking an loan should watch out for lenders advertising personal loans for bad credit or unsecured loans with no credit check -- these are not really personal loans. They are really payday loans, check advance loans or title loans -- with very short terms and very high interest rates.
 

Unsecured Personal Loan Interest Rates and Terms
Terms typically range from two to five years. The borrower receives a lump sum and repays the loan with equal monthly installments. Unsecured loan interest rates are usually fixed. However, there are also revolving lines of credit, which function like credit cards. Borrowers set them up and draw on them as needed, paying interest only on the amounts used. The monthly payment is based on the loan balance and interest rate, which is variable.
Interest rates on unsecured loans (the legitimate kind) vary according to the lender's policies and the credit ratings of the borrowers. In 2014, rates for loans range from 6-7 percent at the low end to about 40 percent at the high end.










Unsecured vs Secured Personal Loans
Loans fall into two categories – unsecured or secured. There are benefits and drawbacks to both, but the biggest difference lies in whether the loan requires collateral.



Unsecured Personal Loans

 Does not require putting property or assets up as collateral - collateral is an item or items put up as security for the loan, meaning it can be seized if you default on the loan
 Often requires higher credit and has higher interest rates while offering lower borrowing limits
 Getting an unsecured loan is mostly based on your creditworthiness
 Types of unsecured loans include most personal loans, student loans, and credit cards



Secured Personal Loans

 Requires putting up property or assets up as collateral, which may be seized if you default on the loan. The asset you are taking the loan for is often the collateral for the loan - for example, if you are getting a mortgage, the house you are buying is the collateral
 Offers higher loan limits and are easier to get than unsecured loans because the lender takes on less risk if you default
 If you cannot get an unsecured loan, it may be easier to be approved for a secured loan with collateral
 Types of secured loans include car loans, mortgages and HELOC

Payday Loans Approved In 2 Minutes
Everybody experiences a short fall between paychecks.  It is often difficult to ask for help, let alone find it.  We have one simple goal: solving
            your short term cash needs as securely, discreetly, and as quickly as possible.  Our service consists of a large, 100+ lender network.  We can typically match most applicants with a loan.
How it Works
Our service is completely free and all repayment terms are between you and the lender. Each lender has different loan terms, such as the loan amount, the APR for the loan, repayment schedules, etc.
At QuickerCash.com, we understand you need help, and you need it quickly.  Getting the money you 
            deserve should be simple and painless.  This is actually how we have designed our process.
First, complete our no-obligation 5-minute application.  It is simple and straight forward:
	          we only ask you for information we need to approve your loan.  Your information is also secure as we use the latest 
	          technology in website encryption.  Immediately after you submit your application, we can 
	          match you with a lender.  If your not matched, we will tell you.
Upon approval with a third party lender, you will be presented with a loan offer.  This will be a detailed document explaining your loan 
	          with complete rate and fee disclosure.  If everything looks good, you can accept the loan offer using your 
	          e-signature.  If the loan offer does not satisfy your needs, simply decline.  There is never any obligation to 
	          accept the loan!  You can also exit the process at any time and feel comfortable your information is safe.
If you choose to accept the loan offered, your funds will automatically be deposited into your bank account. The latest you will receive your funds is usually one business day.
How Much Does it Cost?
The lenders in our lending network may offer you a loan with an APR between: 22.9% and 1304%
The APR on a small dollar, short term loan represents the amount of your loan, cost of the loan, term of the loan and repayment amounts and timing.  Loans on the lower end of the APR range may be for a larger loan amount and for a longer term.  Loans on the higher end of the APR range may be for a smaller loan amount and for a shorter term.  Depending on your credit needs, and desire to pay your loan off quickly, your lender may only offer you loans with an APR near the high end of the range displayed. 
NOTICE: THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE FORM OF CREDIT. A SHORT TERM LOAN SHOULD BE USED FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL NEEDS ONLY, NOT AS A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL SOLUTION.  CUSTOMERS WITH CREDIT DIFFICULTIES SHOULD SEEK CREDIT COUNSELING OR MEET WITH A NONPROFIT FINANCIAL COUNSELING SERVICE IN THEIR COMMUNITY.
What Happens if I Don't Pay My Loan According to its Terms?
If you do not pay your loan according to its terms, your lender may: Charge you late fees, Send your account to a collection agency, Report your information to a consumer reporting agency which may negatively affect your credit score, or offer to extend your loan which may cause you to incur additional fees, charges and interest.
We are not a lender.  Only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms and APR and the implications for non-payment of your loan.  Ask your lender for their current rates and charges and their policies for non-payment.

How it Works
QuickerCash.com is a lending network, NOT a lender. Our service is completely free and all repayment terms are between you and the lender. Each lender has different loan terms, such as the loan amount, the APR for the loan, repayment schedules, etc.
At QuickerCash.com, we understand you need help, and you need it quickly.  Getting the money you 
            deserve should be simple and painless.  This is actually how we have designed our process.
First, complete our no-obligation 5-minute application.  It is simple and straight forward:
	          we only ask you for information we need to approve your loan.  Your information is also secure as we use the latest 
	          technology in website encryption.  Immediately after you submit your application, we can 
	          match you with a lender.  If your not matched, we will tell you.
Upon approval with a third party lender, you will be presented with a loan offer.  This will be a detailed document explaining your loan 
	          with complete rate and fee disclosure.  If everything looks good, you can accept the loan offer using your 
	          e-signature.  If the loan offer does not satisfy your needs, simply decline.  There is never any obligation to 
	          accept the loan!  You can also exit the process at any time and feel comfortable your information is safe.
Receiving Your Loan
If you choose to accept the loan offered, your funds will automatically be deposited into your bank account
			      you have listed with us in as little as one hour.  The latest you will receive your funds is usually one business day.
Paying Back Your Loan
The loan offer will show you your loan payback date, and the ways in which you can pay it off.  Typically
		        our customers choose to have it conveniently withdrawn from the bank account the loan was initially deposited into.

FAQ

Rates & Terms
Submitting your inquiry for a loan at QuickerCash.com incurs absolutely no cost. QuickerCash.com is not a lender and does not provide lending services directly to consumers. Based on the information you submit, QuickerCash.com searches its database housing its vast network of lenders to pair you with the lender and loan that may be suited to your needs so that you can submit an application directly to the lender.
The Truth in Lending Act requires full disclosure of all loan fees and interest rates that borrowers may incur. All fees and rate information should be disclosed to you by your lender at the time of approval. Upon the conclusion of lender approval, most lenders will direct you to an e-signature page. This page is provided to you by the lender to which you were matched.
Full Disclosure of Terms
The lender provides documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan being offered to you by the lender. Please review the fee and rate information provided to you by your lender at this time thoroughly and completely before agreeing to the terms of the loan. You are under no obligation to accept these terms. If you decide the loan terms detailed in the lender contract are acceptable and wish to proceed with the loan process, e-sign the page and await transfer of your funds.
The loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by your lender, with specific amounts determined based upon the information you submitted to the lender. QuickerCash.com has no control or knowledge of the loan details between you and your lender. You are under no obligation to continue with the application process if you find a particular lender’s loan terms unsuitable.
Late Payment Policy
Cash advance lenders have varying policies regarding late payments. Review the late payment policy detailed in the loan documents provided to you by your lender before appending your e-signature, and thereby agreeing to the loan terms. All lenders, however, must abide by applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding late payment fees.
Non-Payment Policy
Additional fees or charges may apply to you in the event that you are unable to repay your loan. QuickerCash.com uses commercially reasonable efforts to work only with reputable lenders dedicated to pursuing collections of past due accounts with conduct that is fair and reasonable.
Loan Renewal Policy
Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. In states where rollovers, or repayment term extensions, are allowed, interest rates, along with any late fees that may be assessed, can add a substantial dollar amount to the end price of your loan. Find your state’s laws and regulations governing rollovers and extensions from among the list down below. Read the lender’s terms in full regarding loan renewal options before signing the loan contract.
State Rate & Fee Regulations
Find your state to review the applicable laws and regulations governing cash advance loan rates and fees in your state.
Our Lending Policy
QuickerCash.com's lenders adhere to strict lending standards.  Please see our Lending Policy for more details.
