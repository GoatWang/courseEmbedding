Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

  Bonds represent the largest asset class in the world. The most affluent investors demand
them, and the most successful advisors rely on them to expand their market
opportunity. However, to capitalize on attractive issues and yield opportunities, advisors
need information, insight and the ability to take quick, decisive action.
   Deep roots and long relationships AAM has been deeply rooted in the fixed income markets for almost 30 years. Our long-standing relationships and trading expertise allow us to establish and maintain an attractive inventory of securities that gives you the opportunity to capitalize on pricing, yields and quality issues.   Dedicated AAM Capital Markets Group As part of our firm’s dedication to client service, our Capital Markets Group (CMG) is comprised of seasoned taxable and municipal fixed income traders. CMG works closely with our very own Advisory Consultants to provide competitive offerings, liquidity, and ongoing support and timely sales ideas to each financial professional we serve.   Seize opportunities with AAM Leveraging our open architecture platform and efficient online capabilities, AAM provides advisors with access to world-class bond solutions. Working with us, advisors can take advantage of competitive pricing and exclusive opportunities that broaden their existing platform and can enhance the value they provide to their clients. In addition, advisors are able to access our own inventory of offerings through our intuitive online offering system.   Needs-based custom portfolios Our analysts can create individual portfolios designed to meet specific investor objectives, such as maximizing income, managing risk, tax-advantaged investing and wealth preservation, and then provide tools to assist with monitoring them against these objectives.   Flexible reporting services AAM conducts comprehensive portfolio reviews for new and existing holdings and produces detailed custom reports that show both before and after scenarios, and can be private labeled if needed.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…
