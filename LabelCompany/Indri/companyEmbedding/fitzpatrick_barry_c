After a death, abatement occurs if the deceased person didn't leave enough property to fulfill all the bequests made in the will and meet other expenses.

(more...)All of the property you own when you file for bankruptcy, except for most pensions and educational trusts.

(more...)The distribution of a deceased person's property by any means other than probate. Many types of property pass free of probate, including property left to a surviving spouse and property left outside of a will through probate-avoidance methods such as pay-on-death designations, joint tenancy ownership, living trusts and life insurance. Property that avoids probate is sometimes described as the 'nonprobate estate.' Nonprobate distribution may also occur if the deceased person leaves an invalid will. In that case, property will pass according to the particular state's laws of intestate succession.

ACCUMULATION TRUSTA trust in which the income is retained and not paid out to beneficiaries until certain conditions are met. For example, if Uncle Pierre creates a trust for Nic... (more...)A trust in which the income is retained and not paid out to beneficiaries until certain conditions are met. For example, if Uncle Pierre creates a trust for Nick's benefit but stipulates that Nick will not get a penny until he gets a Ph.D. in French; Nick is the beneficiary of an accumulation trust.

TRUST CORPUSLatin for 'the body' of the trust. This term refers to all the property transferred to a trust. For example, if a trust is established (funded) with $250,000, t... (more...)Latin for 'the body' of the trust. This term refers to all the property transferred to a trust. For example, if a trust is established (funded) with $250,000, that money is the corpus. Sometimes the trust corpus is known as the 'res,' a Latin word meaning 'thing.'

TRUSTEE POWERSThe provisions in a trust document defining what the trustee may and may not do.

Delaware Supreme Court Upholds Trust Pre-Mortem Validation Statute 

                        2.18.2015 - Client Alerts - Trusts, Estates & Tax 

On Ravet v. Northern Trust Company of Delaware and Barry C. Fitzpatrick, in Their Capacity as Co-TrusteesC.A. No. 7743-VCGOrder of the Delaware Supreme Court (Feb. 12, 2015)
The Delaware Supreme Court issued an order affirming a bench ruling and letter opinion of the Court of Chancery precluding an action to contest the validity of a trust under Delaware’s pre-mortem validation statute, 12 Del. C. § 3546.  In the Court of Chancery matter, In the Matter of Restatement of Declaration of Trust Creating the Survivor’s Trust Created Under the Ravet Family Trust Dated Feb. 9, 2012, C.A. No. 7743-VCG, V.C. Glasscock (June 4, 2014), Petitioner, claimed that the restatement of Petitioner’s mother’s revocable trust was the product of undue influence by his sister.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Chancery’s holding that Petitioner’s claim against the co-trustees of the trust was time-barred because notice under 12 Del. C. § 3546 was delivered to his last known address and he failed to challenge the trust within 120 days and provided no credible evidence that the notice wasn’t delivered.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
