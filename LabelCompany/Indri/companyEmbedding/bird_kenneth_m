Bird Supplies
Welcome to the Chewy Bird Shop. We have all the bird supplies you’ll need to care for your pet bird in your home or the visiting flyers in your backyard. You’ll find bird food and treats, cages and cage accessories, litter and nesting products, bird perches and bird toys, and grooming and health supplies. Like we said—all the bird supplies you'll need. Here are some top products enjoyed by fellow bird enthusiasts. 

Treats aren’t just meant for dogs; birds can enjoy a tasty snack too. Kaytee Natural Spray Millet Bird Treats will entertain and mentally stimulate your bird by keeping her active, encouraging foraging, alleviating stress, and preventing boredom and behaviors associated with inactivity. Your pet bird can have a home of her own with Prevue Pet Products Wrought Iron Small & Medium Birds Flight Cage. Bird owners love the beautiful wrought iron cage with two large front doors and a bottom shelf for additional storage. Wild bird watchers could consider the Perky-Pet Deluxe Chalet Cedar Feeder, it holds not only seed, but two suet cakes as well, attracting all kinds of birds, near and far. 

Skip the newspaper and try Kaytee Kay Kob Bird & Small Animal Natural Bedding & Litter. Bird enthusiasts who use it enjoy this natural corncob product because it’s highly absorbent and helps eliminate odors. And if you’re looking to make cleanup even easier, consider Hartz Bird & Small Animal Absorbent Cage Liners. Simply place them at the bottom of your cage and cover with your pet's favorite bedding for superior moisture and odor absorption. 

Give your bird a comfortable place to perch with the Booda Large Comfy Bird Perch. This simple, multi-colored rope can be twisted and bent to create all sorts of fun shapes for your pet to explore. And bird enthusiasts agree, Prevue Pet Products Naturals Coco Hideaway with Ladder Bird Toy is the ultimate toy, handmade from 100% natural, eco-friendly Hevea wood branches, coconut shell and natural sisal rope to encourage foot and beak exercise. 

Keep your bird healthy and happy with the help of Zoo Med Bird Banquet Fruit Formula Mineral Block Beak Conditioner, with a mixture of nutritious tropical fruits in a solid calcium base. Or try JW Pet InSight Cuttlebone Holder Bird Toy—the simplest way to give your bird the trace minerals and calcium he needs and to keep his beak strong and healthy.

Take a look around the Chewy Bird Shop for all of your bird care needs. You’ll find these and many other bird supplies that all the other bird lovers are raving about. Happy shopping!

University of Nebraska Medical Center


                  In addition to providing training for today’s leading medical and
healthcare fields, University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) is at the
forefront of major research activities.

Located in Omaha, Nebraska, UNMC is particularly well known and respected
for its programs in Nursing, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy and Physician
Assisting. UNMC also has a medical and dental school that trains future
doctors and dentists.

In addition to offering high-quality medical education, UNMC conducts
hundreds of research projects yearly at its Durham Research Centers.
Research activities include discoveries and contributions in such areas
as cancer treatments and transplant medicine.

Since the student population remains relatively small, both classes and
research activities take place in small groups, giving students the
chance to work with faculty members, who are leaders and pioneers in
their field.

Additional healthcare education programs include training for such fields
as Clinical Laboratory Science, Cytotechnology, Medical Sonography and
Radiation Therapy.

Each program has its own admission requirements. Students may also apply
for funding through research assistantships and fellowships.

The birds love it and with the over head hood (separate purchase) the squirrels can't get to it. I was amazed that I ordered it on the 17th and it arrived on the 19th.

Finches, pine siskins, chickadees, and nuthatches all find it irresistible. It is also sturdy enough to withstand the antics of squirrels and falls to the ground. The design allows one to pour feed in without it pouring out the sides or bottom, a problem I have had with other feeders. However, the strength of the design is also its only weakness, in that the internal structure makes it a bit difficult to swab out.How would you rate the packaging of the product?AverageHow would you compare the item you received to the way it was displayed on the site?

Bird Supplies
Welcome to the Chewy Bird Shop. We have all the bird supplies you’ll need to care for your pet bird in your home or the visiting flyers in your backyard. You’ll find bird food and treats, cages and cage accessories, litter and nesting products, bird perches and bird toys, and grooming and health supplies. Like we said—all the bird supplies you'll need. Here are some top products enjoyed by fellow bird enthusiasts. 

Treats aren’t just meant for dogs; birds can enjoy a tasty snack too. Kaytee Natural Spray Millet Bird Treats will entertain and mentally stimulate your bird by keeping her active, encouraging foraging, alleviating stress, and preventing boredom and behaviors associated with inactivity. Your pet bird can have a home of her own with Prevue Pet Products Wrought Iron Small & Medium Birds Flight Cage. Bird owners love the beautiful wrought iron cage with two large front doors and a bottom shelf for additional storage. Wild bird watchers could consider the Perky-Pet Deluxe Chalet Cedar Feeder, it holds not only seed, but two suet cakes as well, attracting all kinds of birds, near and far. 

Skip the newspaper and try Kaytee Kay Kob Bird & Small Animal Natural Bedding & Litter. Bird enthusiasts who use it enjoy this natural corncob product because it’s highly absorbent and helps eliminate odors. And if you’re looking to make cleanup even easier, consider Hartz Bird & Small Animal Absorbent Cage Liners. Simply place them at the bottom of your cage and cover with your pet's favorite bedding for superior moisture and odor absorption. 

Give your bird a comfortable place to perch with the Booda Large Comfy Bird Perch. This simple, multi-colored rope can be twisted and bent to create all sorts of fun shapes for your pet to explore. And bird enthusiasts agree, Prevue Pet Products Naturals Coco Hideaway with Ladder Bird Toy is the ultimate toy, handmade from 100% natural, eco-friendly Hevea wood branches, coconut shell and natural sisal rope to encourage foot and beak exercise. 

Keep your bird healthy and happy with the help of Zoo Med Bird Banquet Fruit Formula Mineral Block Beak Conditioner, with a mixture of nutritious tropical fruits in a solid calcium base. Or try JW Pet InSight Cuttlebone Holder Bird Toy—the simplest way to give your bird the trace minerals and calcium he needs and to keep his beak strong and healthy.

Take a look around the Chewy Bird Shop for all of your bird care needs. You’ll find these and many other bird supplies that all the other bird lovers are raving about. Happy shopping!
