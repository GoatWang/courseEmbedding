 "Improving Plant [Re-]Productivity"







Accelerated Ag Technologies, LLC brings innovative, next generation solutions to large problems in agriculture.  With decades of experience, a team of agricultural industry experts with diverse breadth recently formed a venture to impact the overall reliability of agricultural production.  Accelerated Ag Technologies has developed several proprietary, patent pending methods to improve the way the seed industry produces and delivers high yielding products to their customers.











Todd Krone, Ph.D. Chief Executive Officer 



Todd has over 20 years of research experience in the seed and biotech industry, including both research and leadership positions at Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer.  His career has focused on applying molecular tools for enabling plant improvement, biotech trait development, developing plant genetics based research strategies and leading large research teams that operate at the intersection of discovery and product development.  Prior to forming Accelerated Ag Technologies, Todd served as a senior research director leading global mid-stream development efforts for biotech traits at DuPont Pioneer. 






Jason CopeChief Technology Officer 



Jason has 20 years of experience in leading the development of theoretical and applied engineering solutions for agricultural biotechnology.  Formerly with DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, Jason has leveraged his broad and deep knowledge of science and applied engineering to partner closely and effectively with industry business partners in need of next generation technology solutions. These partnerships have resulted in the development of numerous agricultural industry impacting technologies.  Jason currently has more than 40 pending and granted US patents.  Prior to joining Accelerated Ag Technologies, Jason served as the leader of Enabling Technologies at DuPont Pioneer. 






Mark E. Westgate, Ph.D.Chief Science Officer 



 Mark is a Professor of Crop Production and Physiology in the Department of Agronomy at Iowa State University.  Dr. Westgate is recognized internationally as an authority on corn and soybean reproductive development, and has conducted collaborative research in Europe, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  He is a Fellow of the American Society of Agronomy, Fellow of the Crop Science Society of America, and Science Fellow of the Australian National University.  His research program centers on understanding the physiological mechanisms controlling the response of seed formation and development to environmental stresses.  Westgate's research and collaborations have coupled the quantitative aspects of floral biology with the physical drivers of pollen dispersal in several crops, and have used this approach to predict seed formation and out-crossing in maize seed and grain production.

Product/ServicesAAT’s technology will not be regulated and once scaled and optimized, can be used immediately by major seed companies for each application. AAT’s major product is intellectual property for methods that will enable the seed industry to reduce the expenses associated with seed production for current hybrid crops, while enabling cost effective hybrid seed production for the first time in varietal or self-pollinated crops. In addition to intellectual property, we will provide services and tools which enable the processes and methods.Target MarketThe target market is the global seed industry. Within the global seed industry, we are focusing on the U.S. seed industry first. Within the seed industry, AAT’s technology breaks down into several major categories. The first minimal viable product serves both seed researchers and parent seed producers. This forms the foundation for larger markets that include hybrid seed and grain production.Business ModelInitial value capture will be via corn applications, which will form the ground work for continuing self-funded R&D in wheat and rice. The route to market is to license royalty bearing intellectual property to agricultural seed companies, while keeping options open for out-right sale of patents and/or portions of the company. Applications beyond agriculture (e.g. horticulture) will be maintained for future research and intellectual property interests. CustomersWithin the U.S. seed industry, the most basic customer segment in which the minimal viable product will be offered in 2017 is corn seed producers in research and parent seed production. The technology will be scaled up from these segments to be offered to corn hybrid seed producers in 2018 and corn grain producers in 2019.  Sales/Marketing StrategyAAT’s initial strategy is to collaborate with select, second tier seed companies where our processes can improve efficiencies in research programs and corn parent seed production. With basic enablement from AAT, the IP will be simple to implement. These collaborations form the ground work for the next phase which focuses on corn hybrid seed producers. The initial phase is implemented and we anticipate initiating the second phase in 2017.  CompetitorsFor more than 20 years, major global seed companies have focused and spent billions on the development of biotech traits at the expense of improving seed production methods. The only effort to this end has focused on developing male sterility to enable and improve hybridity in plants. This approach is limited for crops like corn, as only 2 percent of hybrid seed is produced using genetic male sterility. In addition, this approach has failed for important crops like wheat, in which 50+ years (and counting) of efforts have not enabled cost effective production of hybrid seed.Competitive AdvantageAAT’s intellectual property takes a new look at hybrid seed production and bypasses the resource intensive steps employed by current seed production methods. As a result of our competitors placing the majority of their focus on genetic male sterility technologies, AAT is afforded the competitive edge to gain first mover advantages in a technology area with little existing intellectual property.

Accelerated Ag Technologies  $600000  Financing. Todd Krone  Published Jul 20  Filing


07/20/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Accelerated Ag Technologies  $600000  Financing. Todd Krone  Published Jul 20  Filing and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/accelerated-ag-technologies-600000-financing-todd-krone-published-jul-20-filing/108865/.CaptchaSubmit
Accelerated Ag Technologies  Financing
Accelerated Ag Technologies, Llc, Limited Liability Company just  filed form D  about $600,000 debt financing. This is a new filing. Accelerated Ag Technologies, Llc is expected to  sell $600,000 in this  offering. The total  private offering amount was $600,000.  The fundraising form was filed on 2015-07-20. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $600,000 more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Accelerated Ag Technologies  is based in Iowa. The  filler’s business is Other Technology. The  form was  filed by Todd Krone President.  The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 6607 Brook Ridge Ct., Johnston, Ia, Iowa, 50131.  Todd Krone is the related person in the form and it has address: 6607 Brook Ridge Ct., Johnston, Ia, Iowa, 50131. Link to Accelerated Ag Technologies  Filing: 000164861915000002.
Analysis of Accelerated Ag Technologies  Offering
On average,  companies in the Other Technology sector, sell 85.80% of the total offering  size. Accelerated Ag Technologies  sold 0.00% of the offering.  The fundraising is still open. The average  investment floor size for companies in the Other Technology industry is $1.54 million. The offering was 100.00% smaller than the average of $1.54 million.  Of course this should not be  seen as negative.  Firms  get financed for  a variety of  needs and reasons. The minimum investment for this  fundraising  was set at $25000. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Accelerated Ag Technologies  Also
The Form D signed by Todd Krone might help Accelerated Ag Technologies, Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
