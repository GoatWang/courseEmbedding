40 Under 40: Where Are They Now?

Catching up with Peter Crist

Since Crain's launched its annual 40 Under 40 feature in 1989, nearly 1,000 up-and-coming Chicagoans have earned the title. Starting this year, we're taking a monthly look back, checking in with past "40s" to recap what these local leaders have been up to since their names were added to the honor roll.

Click here to see the first two installments in the series: fashion designer Barbara Bates and Alderman-restaurateur Tom Tunney.

Peter Crist (1991)
Crist/Kolder Associates, Hinsdale
Then: Manager of the Chicago office of Russell Reynolds Associates Inc., a global executive search firm. At 38, already considered a consummate matchmaker and skilled headhunter. Up at 4 a.m., exercising on his stationary bike 1.5 hours, breakfast meetings by 8.

Now: Founder and chairman of a boutique executive recruiting firm, closer in age and experience to his clients. Two sons working for the firm. Serves as chairman of the board of Wintrust Financial Corp., board member of Hinsdale Bank & Trust Co. and member of the board of directors of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare. At 60, still up by 4 a.m. and exercising on his bike. 

What being named a '40' meant to him
"It didn't dawn on me the significance of it until later years because I was in an early class and didn't appreciate the competition to get in until later on. But every year, as I studied the profiles of the participants, I realized how significant the accolade was, even though it was 1991."

Moving on from Russell Reynolds
"I found myself in my early 40s tending to the firm's needs, which would be hiring, firing and opening offices. I was being pulled by firmwide interests when, in my heart, I wanted to be doing client work. My mentors, Ferdinand Nadhery and Chuck Kepler, said, 'Look, you've got to make a decision between doing client work or ascending with the firm.' This is when my true heart said I was a client guy and wanted to build a firm that was truly client-centric."

Being a client guy
“Now I devote all my time to doing client work on a national level. We're doing projects now with American Express, Xerox — we have a project with Safeway in California. I'm a finder. So it's very focused, but there has been far more travel time because clients want me to be out meeting the talent. I'm a much better client person than a business manager, and I acknowledge that. I believe small businesses at the very high end can do extraordinarily well. And I believe we're hitting the cover off the ball right now.”

He's just a plane ride or phone call away
"I'm a 7 million miles American Airlines guy. Did you see that movie with George Clooney, 'Up in the Air'? I'm that guy. This business allows me great independence. This business allows me the flexibility since I am a telephone and airplane person. We have a place in Naples, and I can go to Naples and nobody knows where I'm calling from and they don't care. Honestly, if you're in an airplane and telephone business like me, people just want to know they can get to you. "

Hiring instincts
"What I do is a little bit of art and a little bit of science. The science piece is the information we have, the data we have. It's the art piece that comes to play when I'm physically with someone. You do this for 38 years, I'm not a Ph.D., but my instincts, I think, are very finely honed, so I will be able to tell you certain things about a human being. I can say whether it's a good fit. Most of my clients, at the high end, at the end of a search will employ an industrial psychologist to shrink someone just to make sure. New recruiters don't have the ability to assess like a 30-year person does."

Lessons learned
"Not trying to do everything for all clients. If you're a service business, you have to pick where you want to go and put all your efforts into that rather than try to be everything to everybody. I have learned that if you want to be successful you have to work hard. There is no disconnecting the two. I get up at 4 in the morning every day, I work out and go to work, and that's just the nature of the beast."

Retire? Naw.
"In my space, it takes 30 years to get to a point where now, I'm on an equivalent basis with my clients. In other words, I'm dealing with CEOs, boards of directors every day and I'm on an equivalent level because I'm on a public board, I'm the chairman of a public company. Now our firm is playing at the level that all recruiters dream about. You can't walk away from that. Now my clients view me as a peer, as a partner. The CEO of American Express does not want a lightweight helping him at the most critical hire he is going to be faced with."

Specialties & ExpertisePeter Crist has the following 1 specialty and 2 board certifications.                     Internal Medicine
    An internist is a physician who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of conditions that affect the adult population—both acute and chronic.


    These doctors are often who adults see as their primary physicians because they treat a broad range of illnesses that do not require surgical or specialist interventions. They also work to help a patient maintain optimal health in order to prevent the onset of disease.


    In addition to treating the common cold and flu, internists also treat chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
