Andrew E. ClarkResearch Fellow












 
 
 





Andrew Clark is a CNRS Research Professor at the Paris School of Economics (PSE). He previously held posts at Dartmouth, Essex, CEPREMAP, DELTA, the OECD and the University of Orl�ans.

His work has largely focussed on the interface between psychology, sociology and economics; in particular, using job and life satisfaction scores, and other psychological indices, as proxy measures of utility. The broad area is social interactions and social learning.

One research field has been that of relative utility or comparisons (to others like you, to others in the same household, and to yourself in the past), finding evidence of such comparisons with respect to both income and unemployment. This work has spilled over into theoretical and empirical work on evidence for and the implications of following behaviour and learning from others' actions. Recent work has involved collaboration with psychologists to map out habituation to life events (such as job loss, marriage, and divorce) using long-run panel data. In addition, direct measures of utility allow direct tests of popular models of the labour market. In this spirit, his work has looked at unemployment, quits, and labour market rents. 

He joined IZA as a Research Fellow in February 2004.

Acronym
                    information (AKA "PSE,







































































                      PSE. So good they named it twice"): I used
                    to be at DELTA, but now I'm at PSE. That's because
                    DELTA merged with CERAS and the two research groups
                    of CEPREMAP to form PSE, which thus now has four
                    different governing bodies (CNRS-EHESS-ENPC-ENS). I
                    hope that everything is now clear. But of course,
                    four is not really enough, so in January 2010 we
                    merged with INRA-LEA (who are already on the Jourdan
                    campus), adding the INRA as a fifth governing body.

                    Oh, and PSE is sort of joining forces with (some of)
                    University Paris 1 to form the Paris
School
of

























































































                      Economics. To sum up, I am at PSE, which is
                    part of PSE.

And to
                        prove it's true, we have finally moved to a new
                        building, still on the Jourdan campus. And we were all happy ever
                          after (apart from the shutters that don't
                          shut).

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Clark, Andrew E carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Clark, Andrew E



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Clark, Andrew E



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
