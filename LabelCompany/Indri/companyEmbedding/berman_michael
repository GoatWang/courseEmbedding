Michael Berman
Artfully marrying understated glamour with welcome livability, Berman refers to his signature sophisticated style as American Trans-Modern.

One of the country's most respected designers, Berman's products and interiors reflect his interest in history, art and architecture - especially the Deco period of the 30s and 40s - film noir, and the influence of designers such as Angelo Donghia, Billy Haines, Frances Elkins and Dorothy Draper. 

His work strikes an uncommon balance between timeless style and an of-the-moment relevance. Although clearly inspired by architectural forms and lines - early 30s skyscraper design like the Empire State Building, the Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building come to mind - Berman's work resonates with warmth and approachability.

Information




 At Robert Abbey, design is our passion. We work very hard to bring our customers the most trend right merchandise with the highest quality standards at the best prices possible.


Robert Abbey has been designing and manufacturing fine lighting products since 1948. Our design studios, corporate offices and 350,000 square foot factory are located on a 22 acre campus in the picturesque foothills of North Carolina.  Much of our extensive product line is entirely Made in the U.S.A.


Robert Abbey is a family focused business - quite a few of our team members are 3rd generation Robert Abbey employees. It's not uncommon to find three (sometimes 4) generations of family and team members on hand at our offices and plant in Hickory.




NOTE: Most Robert Abbey Lighting products are shipped directly from Robert Abbey Inc. direct to the customer. Robert Abbey products are assemble to order or made to order and not returnable.
