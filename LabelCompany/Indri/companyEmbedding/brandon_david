You both place your hands in front of you and begin rotating them to test how far your arm can be twisted. Your spectator is soon going to find out that they can only turn their hand half way while you continue to turn and turn and turn your hand until they rub their eyes in disbelief!No more sleeves and bringing your spectators to the ground. Now you can perform in the air, bringing all of your spectator’s in for a closer look. As impromptu as it is shocking, Torque needs no props or gimmicks whatsoever. Includes everything you need to know delivered through online streaming video including instructions, alternate performances, live performances and more.– Easy to learn– Easy to perform– Completely impromptu– Perform sleevelessReviewsThere are no reviews yet.

Add to cart    Add to wishlist    SKU: DVDQUADRANT Categories: Card Magic, Magic DVDs Tags: Brandon David, General, Jul-2012, Penguin Magic, Turchi Chris, Video Description Additional information Reviews (0) Product EnquiryDescriptionWith the Quadrant gimmick you can perform visual magic with an ordinary playing card box. Not only can you perform a super visual color changing box effect but you can make the box shrink, turn it inside out, transform to a completely different object or even make it disappear. The handling is very easy and something that you can take with you anywhere because it takes up no pocket space.Here’s just one of the many effects possible with the quadrant gimmick. After having a card selected, signed and returned to the box you explain to the spectator the idea of being able to invert objects so they are permanently inside out. With a wave of the hand visually the card box is now transformed and now it can only be described as inside out. The inverted box is immediately handed out for examination. After you let that moment of amazement sink in and explain that not only did the card box turn inside out but the previously signed card is found to be inverted too.What makes the Quadrant gimmick so valuable is that you are receiving a high quality, custom made gimmick that is built to last. Also included on the DVD you will learn a color changing deck routine where you also visually change the box. You will learn how to visually shrink a deck of cards and extract their selection from the box. I guess the real question is what will you come up with when you have the quadrant gimmick?Running Time Approximately: 58minPlease follow and like us:  Additional informationWeight0.215 lbsDimensions7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inReviewsThere are no reviews yet.
