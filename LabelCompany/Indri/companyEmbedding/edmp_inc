Through extensive research and analysis, we have discovered and confidently determined that thoroughly understanding and focusing on the clear correlation and functional relationship between earnings and market price leads to superior investment results with a considerable reduction in risk.  It is this understanding that provides EDMP, Inc. with the knowledge of what to invest in, when to invest, and ultimately when to sell any company for our clients' portfolios. We only buy excellent businesses when we see them at sound valuations.  We seek above-average returns by having the discipline to avoid overpaying for even the best companies. Large-Cap Growth See the Performance Page for Detailed Performance Information Our Process We use the S&P Compustat database as the beginning point for our equity universe. Our initial screens take the approximately 12,000 company database down to around 800 for the large-cap product. Our research tool screens for the types of growthy companies we are looking for that reduces this list down to under 200. We are typically actively reviewing and researching between 35 to 75 companies for inclusion/exclusion on behalf of the large-cap portfolios. Portfolio Characteristics We tend to concentrate in 20 to 35 holdings. We define the large-cap arena as companies above $5 billion. Our weighted-median market cap tends to be over $20 billion. Our weighted-average market cap tends to be over $40 billion. We invest many hours of research into each holding, such that we tend to be long-term holders of positions. Our turnover averages around 30%. We use a consensus team approach to managing the portfolios. Chuck Carnevale, our Chief Investment Officer, has the final say as to the buy, sell, and hold decisions of the portfolios. 










SMid-Cap GrowthOur ProcessWe use a similar process for managing all of our portfolios, including our SMid-cap portfolios.  The basic difference for finding excellent growing businesses for this product is the SMid-cap size.  We consider a history of double-digit growth in earnings over the past 5 years to be one of the critical factors that separates great businesses from mediocre or average businesses.  We have found that great businesses generate above-average earnings growth over the long run.  Most of our SMid-cap companies have double-digit earnings growth for more than 5 years.We use the S&P Compustat database as the beginning point for our equity universe.  Our initial screens take the 12,000 company database down to around 8,500 for the SMid-cap product.  The SMid-cap universe is where we find the most number of companies with opportunity for above-average growth.  Next, we screen for the types of growing companies we are looking for to reduce this list down to approximately 200.  We are typically actively reviewing and researching between 35 to 75 companies for inclusion/exclusion on behalf of the SMid-cap portfolios.Portfolio CharacteristicsWe tend to concentrate in 20 to 35 holdings. We define the SMid-cap arena as companies between $1 and $10 billion. Our weighted-average market cap tends to be over $5 billion. Our median market cap tends to be over $3 billion. We invest many hours of research into each holding, such that we tend to be long-term holders of positions. Our turnover averages around 65%.In terms of forecast growth, we continue to seek companies with a long-term earnings growth of 15% to 20% or better compounded. 










Growth & IncomeOur ProcessWe use a similar process for managing all of our portfolios, including our Growth & Income portfolio.  The basic difference is our focus on dividend paying businesses only.  In this category, there generally is a trade-off between growth and yield.  The higher the yield, the lower the growth and vice-versa.  Our objective is to invest in high quality companies that provide an increasing dividend income stream and moderate growth.We use the S&P Compustat database for our equity universe.   Our initial screens take the 12,000 company database down to around 2,500 for the Growth & Income product.  The growth and income universe is where we find companies with average to moderate growth and a history of increasing their dividend consistent with that growth.  Next, we screen for the types of growth and income companies that meet our criteria to reduce this list down to approximately 100.  We are typically actively reviewing and researching between 35 to 75 companies for inclusion/exclusion on behalf of the Growth & Income portfolios. Portfolio CharacteristicsWe tend to concentrate in 20 to 35 holdings. We blend higher growing companies with lower yields, but faster growing dividends with slower growing companies with higher yields but slower growing dividends.  Our weighted average market cap tends to be over $3 billion.  Our median market cap tends to be over $15 billion; our weighted-market cap tends to be over $30 billion.  We invest many hours of research into each holding, such that we tend to be long-term holders of positions.  Our turnover averages around 5% or less.In terms of forecast growth, we are willing to accept lower growth as long as a company has a history of increasing their dividend consistent with whatever earnings growth they achieve.

Our GoalProtect and Grow Wealth  
The primary objective of our firm�s investment policy is first and foremost to protect our client�s money while safely growing assets over time.  We believe that a key to increasing your wealth is to first and foremost protect your wealth.  We achieve this objective by adhering to the following principles:

Investing only in great businesses that are industry leaders with proven track records of operating excellence.
Understanding the importance of valuation and only purchasing stocks we believe are priced at or below their True Worth�.  Experience has proven that most of the money is made using a sound buy discipline. 
Selling great businesses that we like, but are trading well above their True Worth�.  We realize that even great businesse can become dangerously overvalued.
Avoiding deeply cyclical companies whose earnings are erratic.  We consider these to be trading stocks, rather than securities in which to invest for the long-term, and we are not traders.
Adhering to our sound investing principles and having the conviction to stay the course through both bull and bear markets.  Occasionally, we will sell a stock that is overvalued relative to its True Worth�, but whose market price is still rising.  Since equities eventually revert to their True Worth�, and we believe that market timing is a less than perfect science, we have found this to be a prudent way of protecting your assets over the long-term.
Knowing our companies extremely well by investing significant intellectual capital and resources to clearly understand each of our great businesses.  We use both quantitative and qualitative analysis when selecting stocks for our portfolios.  Both are vitally important when choosing the next best stock.
Providing diversification within a concentrated portfolio.  We balance our portfolios and avoid allocating too much of the portfolio to a particular sector or idea.  

We take our responsibility to protect and grow your wealth seriously.  Our interests are directly aligned with those of our clients.  We strive to ensure that every relationship is both long and prosperous.  















Our Goal: We try to be the best communicating money manager and also make every attempt to do what is in your best interest, and in doing so, to build a positive view in how the investment community views money managers.  .Copyright � 2009 EDMP, Inc.
