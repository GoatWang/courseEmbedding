Governing Law
Use of this Site and these Terms and Conditions of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these Terms and Conditions of Use are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a Court of competent jurisdiction, then that portion of the Terms and Conditions of Use will be deemed severable and will not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining portions of these Terms and Conditions of Use.
Any dispute concerning your use of this Site shall be submitted to binding arbitration in New York within one (1) year from the date that the cause of action arose (or, if multiple cause of actions are involved, from the date that the first cause of action arose), with such arbitration conducted pursuant to the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms and Conditions shall be joined to any other arbitration initiated pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions, Basswood may at any time seek injunctive or other appropriate relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of New York or in any other court having jurisdiction, in the event that Basswood believes that you have violated or threatened to violate any of Basswood's intellectual property rights and, in such case, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such court.
In the event that any portion of these Terms and Conditions are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a Court of competent jurisdiction, in any jurisdiction for any reason, including but not limited to the scope, duration or area of its applicability, unless narrowed by construction, such provision shall for purposes of such jurisdiction only, be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision had been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable (or if such language cannot be drawn narrowly enough, the court making any such determination shall have the power to modify, to the extent necessary to make such provision or provisions enforceable in such jurisdiction, such scope, duration or area or all of them and such provision shall then be applicable in such modified form in such jurisdiction). If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such provision would be held to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction only, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions. No narrowed construction, court-modification or invalidation of any provision shall affect the construction, validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by Basswood of any term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or of any other term or condition and Basswood's failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.
