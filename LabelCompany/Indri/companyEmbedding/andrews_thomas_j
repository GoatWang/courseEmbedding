               Neuronetics, Inc. is a privately held medical device company focused on developing non-invasive therapies for psychiatric and neurological disorders using MRI-strength magnetic field pulses. We are the first company to have a non-systemic and non-invasive depression treatment cleared by the FDA for patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant medication*. Based in Malvern, PA, we are the leader in the development of NeuroStar TMS Therapy (transcranial magnetic stimulation), a non-invasive form of neuromodulation. Incorporated in 2003, we began by licensing a revolutionary patented coil design from Emory University. Using this new, more efficient coil, our first TMS Therapy research units were built and used to complete the largest clinical trial ever conducted (23 international sites) evaluating NeuroStar TMS Therapy® in the treatment of major depression. Since completing clinical trials, our experienced Product Development group has continued to refine our early research device to develop a high quality, efficient, user friendly commercial unit - the NeuroStar TMS Therapy® system. In October of 2008, the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system received FDA clearance for the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients who have failed to receive benefit from prior antidepressant therapy. *NeuroStar TMS Therapy is available by prescription only. Our goal moving forward is to partner with healthcare professionals by providing them the best products and services possible. We are committed to continuous product improvement and to developing new and innovative solutions to meet our customers' needs. By providing these tools, we can help healthcare professionals achieve their ultimate goal of effectively treating the patients they serve. *NeuroStar TMS Therapy® is indicated for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in adult patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current episode.
