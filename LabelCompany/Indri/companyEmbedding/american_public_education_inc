American Public Education Inc (APEI): Can It Deliver A Superior ROE To Its Industry?



Jodi Pearce 


            				July 15, 2017			        


 American Public Education Inc (NASDAQ:APEI), with a ROE of 7.1% over the past twelve months, appeared relatively inefficient compared to the broader industry, which averaged 25.49% ROE. Often, we are quick to attribute a sub-par ROE to inneficient company performance. But to make an opinion on the quality of a company’s returns, an investor must look at the factors behind such performance. View our latest analysis for American Public Education 
Breaking down ROE — the mother of all ratios
 ROE ratio basically calculates the net income as a percentage of total capital committed by shareholders, namely shareholders’ equity.Any ROE north of 20%, implying 20 cents return on every dollar invested, is favourable for any investor. But investors seek multiple assets to diversify risk and an industry-specific comparison makes more sense to achieve the goal of choosing the best among a given lot.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 No matter how high or low return a company generates on equity, it should be more than the cost of equity for value creation. For APEI, the cost of equity estimate comes at 11.17% based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the current risk free rate and a levered beta to account for financial leverage. That compares to American Public Education’s 7.1% ROE.


 American Public Education (NasdaqGS:APEI) Last Perf Jul 15th 17
 
                         ROE can be broken down into three ratios using the Dupont formula. The profit margin is the income as a percentage of sales, while asset turnover highlights how efficiently a company is using the resources at its disposal. Increased leverage, primarily through raising debt, is good for a profitable company, but only to the extent it doesn’t make the firm insolvent in a time of crisis.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 Among the ratios affecting ROE, the profit margin is the most important as it highlights the operational efficiency of a company. To a potential investor, the ideal scenario would be profit increasing at a higher rate than the revenue.The asset turnover for a capital intensive industry such as bricks-and-mortar retail would be substantially lower than the e-commerce retail industry. A comparison with the industry can be drawn through ROA, which represents earnings as a percentage of assets. American Public Education’s ROA stood at 8.2% in the past year, compared to the industry’s 9.98%.
 

 American Public Education (NasdaqGS:APEI) Historical Debt Jul 15th 17
 
 The impact of leverage on ROE is reflected in a company’s debt-equity profile. Rapidly rising debt compared to equity, while profit margin and asset turnover underperform, raises a red flag on the ROE. It’s important as a company can inflate its ROE by consistently increasing debt despite weak operating performance. APEI’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 0. Investors should be cautious about any sharp change in this ratio, more so if it’s due to increasing debt.
Why is ROE called the mother of all ratios
 On the surface, ROE appears to be a simple profitability ratio indicating the return an investor should expect. However, for a sound investment consideration, it should still appear good when a company’s debt profile, profit-revenue trend, and leverage are considered.

On July 18 the Texas Legislature convenes for a special session to address 20 items, one of which is a $1,000 pay raise for teachers.Education spending represents a major chunk of each state's budget, bloated with the usual unnecessary layers of government bureaucracy. In 2012 Congressional testimony, Neal McCluskey with the Cato Institute stated, "Our public schools have been on a decades-long hiring binge with ultimately no gains to show for it."In May 2017, EdChoice, formerly the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, released its updated report,  "Back to the Staffing Surge: The Great Teacher Salary Stagnation and the Decades Long Employment Growth in American Public Schools."This study finds that, for 65 years, American public education has been on a binge of hiring employees that far exceeds the increases needed to keep pace with student enrollment growth. Using U.S. Department of Education statistics, the study categorized the data into two areas of employment growth: teachers and all other staff. "All others" included district and school administrators, teacher aides, counselors, social workers, reading and math coaches, janitors, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and curriculum specialists.The initial staffing surge occurred from the 1950s through 1992 because schools began to admit special needs students and to implement racial integration. But the staffing surge has continued even after the initial 42-year period ended in 1992. This modern surge has been expensive for taxpayers, with no gains to show for it.Although there was a 27 percent nationwide increase in per-pupil spending after 1992, the money was spent primarily for hiring non-teachers. Teacher salaries actually decreased by 2 percent.During the Great Recession from 2009 to 2012, there was a staffing retreat, with a resumption in the staffing surge in 2012. The study notes that, "If public school staffing was very important to student outcomes, we would have expected to see declines in student outcomes during the staffing retreat. Those declines did not come, as American public schools did not experience a decline in measured student outcomes when its staffing decreased."Between 1950 and 2015 the number of students in American public schools doubled. In comparing the increase in the number of students with the increase in staffing,
All full-time staffing increased fourfold
Teaching staff increased two-and-a-half times
All other staff increased more than sevenfold.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, on a nationwide basis, state governments collectively spend around 30 percent of their budgets on education. In Texas, education is the largest state expenditure for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, accounting for 37.6 percent of all spending.Between 1992 and 2014, Texas public school teacher salaries increased only 1 percent, while per-pupil spending increased 17 percent.The study concludes that, had the national increase in the number of all other staff kept pace with student enrollment growth between 1992 and 2015, American public schools would have saved $34.9 billion annually.The study suggests two uses for this annual savings of nearly $35 billion:
Give teachers an additional $11,128 per year, or
Fund education savings accounts with $8,000 annually for nearly 4.4 million students to offset the cost of private school tuition.
According to the study, had the increase in the number of all other staff kept pace with student enrollment growth between 1992 and 2015, Texas would have saved $2 billion. This could have paid for a permanent increase in teacher salaries of $6,318.The elite send their children to private schools with excellent teachers and without computerized learning. Texas is moving toward computers to replace teachers to save money on teacher salaries,  yet we continue to spend millions on unnecessary non-teaching bureaucracy. Given growing public anger, Texas lawmakers need to rethink how they are using taxpayer money for public education.Carole Haynes is an education analyst.

American Public Education, Inc. Surely Wishes More of the American Public Attended Its Schools
New student enrollment continues its precipitous fall.

American Public is hoping for more graduates to cross its stage. Image: American Public Education.
For-profit schools have had a very rough five years. As far back as 2011, however, I singled out American Public Education (NASDAQ:APEI) as one of the few bright spots in an industry rife with misaligned incentives.
Because the company focused on military students, had lower-than-average default rates, and offered classes for far less than other companies, I believed that American Public might actually make a good investment.
But even American Public has stumbled on tough times, with the stock having lost half of its value since last February. Based on earnings that the company released this week, I don't see things improving any time soon.

Owners in American Public stock might cheer the fact that earnings came in ahead of expectations, even if there was a miss on revenue.
But it's important to note that revenue was down 10% from the same time last year, and earnings dropped even more -- roughly 20%.
Management's midpoint guidance for the fourth quarter is non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share on revenue of $84 million. For comparison, analysts are expecting the same level of earnings on $85.5 million.





What happened with American Public this quarter? No matter what, however, the big, important numbers for American Public still aren't moving in the right direction:

Net course registrations at the American Public University system fell 6% from the same time last year.
Overall student enrollment was down even more, shrinking 11% year over year.
More critically, net course registrations by new students -- which really show the direction that the school is going -- were down significantly. At the American Public University System, they were down 19%, an acceleration from earlier in the year.
The company's much smaller subsidiary, the Hondros School of Nursing, also reported that new student enrollment was down 5%.

What management had to say The precipitous drop in new student enrollment is what investors should be focused on. In the company's previous conference call, management signaled that it expected new student enrollments to fall between 19% and 23%. Looked at in this light, you could actually argue that the quarter wasn't that disappointing.
In the earnings release, management stated, "The decline in total net course registrations by new students was primarily the result of a 35% year-over-year decline in net course registrations by new students who use Federal Student Aid (FSA) as their primary funding source." 
Management is stuck in a no-win situation. For much of its existence, American Public relied on Military Tuition Assistance for active personal and Veterans Affairs benefits to help students pay for tuition.





But a few years back, they realized that they needed to diversify their income base, and started trying to attract non-military students. These students often use FSA to help pay for school -- so a 35% decline in net course registrations by new students who use FSA clearly signals that this effort isn't going as well as planned.
Looking forward One might look at the company's non-GAAP guidance and think the stock should hold its ground, given how close the forecast is to what analysts are hoping for. But it's important to note that GAAP earnings are expected to come in much lower, at a midpoint of $0.43. The difference is due to the company's having taken a hit for "employee redeployment and the writedown of information technology assets ."
That's not great news, either, as it shows that management wasted money on IT assets and is having a tough time allocating its workforce with smaller enrollment numbers.
