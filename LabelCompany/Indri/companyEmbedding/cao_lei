You no longer have to pester your kid about what outfits are appropriate for school, and your youngster won't spend hours trying to choose the best clothes to wear for the day. Uniforms are also great for your budget. Get the most out of school uniforms and set your child up for success with help from our Every Day Low Prices. Here's what you need to look for when picking out your child's uniforms for the school year. All-day comfort One purpose of school uniforms is to eliminate distractions in school while teaching kids about the importance of a professional appearance. However, uncomfortable clothing can be just as distracting   if not more. Make sure your child tries on different styles and sizes to see which ones fit best. If your child is sensitive to certain fabrics, choose softer materials like 100 percent cotton, which is less likely to irritate their skin. Tags can be a major source of discomfort, so look for tagless polo shirts and button-down shirts. Uniforms that fit well and are comfortable to wear all day long help your student concentrate on schoolwork rather than the feeling of their clothes distracting them. Durable uniforms to last all year Kids work hard and play hard throughout the school year. As with any other clothing, uniforms are available at several price points. If your child is tough on clothes, it might be worth it to invest in pants with double-layered knees and double-stitched seams. This choice can save you from having to buy new uniforms before the year is over. Treating each top and bottom with waterproofing spray also helps to protect the uniform fabric from spills and stains, keeping them looking fresh all year long. Expressing individuality with colors School uniforms are more rigid than dress codes, and students are limited to certain styles of shirts, pants, shorts, skirts and jumpers. Often, the only flexibility is with the colors of the shirts that students wear. Note that some schools also specify which colors students can wear. If your child's school is flexible with color options, you can use this wiggle room to allow your child to express their individuality. Let your child choose the colors that they feel most comfortable and confident in. The school uniform tops available at Walmart span the rainbow and are available in both long- and short-sleeve styles, whether you need crew-neck shirts, polos or sweaters. Styles for the seasons Make sure that you choose uniforms that fit with all of the seasons. Choose several pairs of pants to get through the fall and winter months and shorts for days with warmer weather. If girls are allowed to wear pants at your child's school, make sure your daughter has these warmer options in her wardrobe for when it's too cold for a skirt or jumper   or if she prefers pants over skirts normally. Easy-care fabrics The last thing you want to do is get up early in the morning to iron the wrinkles out of your child's school uniforms or spend hours on the weekends scrubbing grass stains out of the knees of your child's uniform pants. When shopping for clothing, read the tags to see what the fabric's care tasks entail. Wrinkle-resistant and no-iron fabrics are ready to wear as soon as they come out of the dryer. If your child tends to be messy, dark colors hide stains more easily than other colors. No matter which fabric you choose, be sure to follow the care labels properly to keep your child's uniforms looking sharp throughout the entire school year. Stocking closets for dress-down days Many schools have dress-down days where students are allowed to wear any clothing that adheres to a specific dress code. These policies vary from school to school and can occur weekly, monthly or just on special occasions. In addition to uniforms, be sure to get a few extra school-approved outfits for your child's wardrobe. These can include denim, leggings, dresses, T-shirts and more. Let your child assist in the shopping process so they can wear their favorite styles. Walmart has low prices, every day, on everything, so you can get each item you need to get your child through the school year. Find quality clothing in the latest styles and outfit your child from head to toe for less.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863236, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
