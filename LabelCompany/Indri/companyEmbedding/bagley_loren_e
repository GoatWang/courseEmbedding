Trans Energy, Inc., Loren E. Bagley, and William F. Woodburn: Lit. Rel. No. 17385 / February 27, 2002

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No.  17385  /  February 27, 2002

SEC v. TRANS ENERGY, INC., LOREN E. BAGLEY, AND WILLIAM F. WOODBURN,  U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 1-01-CV-02060

On February 26, 2002, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a permanent injunction against Trans Energy, Inc. (Trans Energy), its former president, Loren E. Bagley (Bagley), and its former vice president and principal financial officer, William F. Woodburn (Woodburn), permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Court's order further enjoins Bagley and Woodburn from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder and orders Bagley and Woodburn to each pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  Trans Energy, Bagley, and Woodburn consented to entry of the permanent injunction and the imposition of civil penalties without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.

The Commission's Complaint alleged that from 1998 through 2000, Trans Energy, at the direction of Bagley and Woodburn, disseminated a number of false and misleading statements to the investing public through press releases, wesbite postings, and Commission filings.  Specifically, Trans Energy issued press releases in October 2000 touting a supposed $612 million worth of oil reserves.  The Complaint alleged that Trans Energy had no reasonable basis to value the potential reserves at that amount.  The Complaint further alleged that in a November 2000 posting on its website, Trans Energy inaccurately minimized the significance of the "going concern statement" included in its most recent filing with the Commission at a time when Trans Energy's ability to continue as a going concern was greatly in doubt.  Additionally, the Commission claimed that in a December 2000 press release about its Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Trans Energy misled the investing public by failing to disclose that the bankruptcy arose from Trans Energy's inability to pay a $600,665.36 consent judgment entered earlier that year, and that a Chapter 7 trustee had been appointed.  Finally, the Complaint alleged that Trans Energy's Commission filings from 1998 through 2000 misrepresented the status of, or failed to disclose the existence of, material lawsuits that resulted in over $1 million in consent judgments against the company.  The Complaint alleged that Bagley and Woodburn, as Trans Energy's only officers, knew or were reckless in not knowing that the above statements were false and misleading.

Maine requires contractors to be licensed to perform work on manufactured or modular homes. A contractors license is not needed to do remodeling or new construction work on typical residential homes
Loren E. Bagley currently holds license HP20000498 (Electricians Helper), which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring Loren E. Bagley



Maine does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance. Regardless, it is advisable to hire contractors with active policies for both forms of insurance. Request a copy of the insurance certificates for your records.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Maine, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, so choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Click here to get started.

However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
