Fighting for Whistleblowers



If you are a whistleblower you have come to the right place. Kohn Kohn & Colpainto (KKC) is the first law firm in the nation exclusively dedicated to the representation of whistleblowers. Our journey began more than three decades ago and we have remained on the cutting edge of whistleblower advocacy ever since. We helped write whistleblower laws and have worked tirelessly to establish whistleblower reward laws. Our work on behalf of whistleblowers saved lives, protected the environment, freed the innocent, and ultimately allowed us to recovered billions of dollars stolen from taxpayers and innocent investors.
