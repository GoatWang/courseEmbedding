Opening a restaurant is easy. Maintaining it is hard. True success comes with finding a great team and working with a great bank. Banc of California simplifies my life and remains consistent, so I can be present to watch over and grow my business.

Los Angeles, CA                
www.celestinopasadena.com 
Giacomino Drago, one of L.A.’s top chefs and the co-owner of nine different restaurants, is best known for his ability to merge the culture of Los Angeles with the flavors of homemade Sicilian cuisine. Coming from the small town of Galati Mamertino in Sicily, he watched his mother knead dough into pasta, simmer tomatoes into sauce, and press olives into olive oil. Each ingredient picked fresh from their garden. Giacomino maintains this same attention to detail in the people he chooses to do business with. At Banc of California, his Relationship Manager of many years simplifies his banking and she, like Giacomino, shares a passion for satisfied customers.
ENTREPRENEUR
The entrepreneur is the lifeblood of capitalism. They have a vision for what's possible and take the risks to make it happen. Entrepreneurs have special needs and Banc of California understands them. Our decision-makers are entrepreneurs themselves, so we view a company's founder as an asset as much as anything on its balance sheet. Our simple, flexible offerings give entrepreneurs the freedom to focus on growing their business instead of sweating over their banking.

As a new teacher turned principal, I enjoy the camaraderie of working with my staff.  My students are now instructors and the school is my classroom. Each lesson plan reinforces  that education is a difficult journey, but one that we embrace.

Ms. Ofelia Valdez discovered education by accident and like many young teachers, she fell in love with the work, retiring after 37 wonderful years in the profession. When our client, Dr. Susan Kumar, began New Horizons Charter Academy, she wanted the best leader for the school.

Today, New Horizons Charter Academy is a model for progressive, inclusive education where every child receives the education they so richly deserve, and Banc of California is there to support the school’s extraordinary vision of a better education.
EXECUTIVE
An executive is responsible for making business happen. They don't perform all the functions of a company, but they are responsible for making sure they get done. That requires strategic planning and organization. But it also means managing people and teams and motivating them to get the job done right.

Kimberly Michel                

Managing Partner, Michel Financial Group                

West Los Angeles, CA                

Kimberly Michel is a consummate professional and spokesperson for the insurance industry. She was elected the first female President of the General Agent and Manager's Association in 1995, and again as the first female President for the Los Angeles Insurance and Financial Advisors Association in 1999. After working for competitors, she and her husband joined forces to start Michel Financial Group, a comprehensive insurance and financial services firm.Ask Kim what matters most to her and she'll tell you it's all about family, community and the positive impact she has in people's lives. As a cancer survivor, she has experienced firsthand the benefits of being prepared and having the peace of mind of knowing she could focus on healing. That's also why she chose Banc of California. "They are warm and welcoming, and they get it. They know what's important in life. They are part of the community."
BUSINESS OWNER
Business owners are the driving force behind our communities. They provide vital products and services as well as jobs. Today, many business owners and entrepreneurs believe part of their mission is to give back to the communities they serve. When a bank looks at its business owner clients as partners in building communities instead of product consumers, businesses grow, communities are enriched, and dreams become reality. That benefits everyone from the entrepreneur to the employees to the customers to those touched by social outreach.

Mercedes Morton is passionate about entrepreneurs whom she views as innovative, courageous, and the engine of our economic growth. After graduating from Stanford Law School and working for two top law firms in Los Angeles, she changed her career path to balance her time between practicing law, family, and serving others in the community. Now her titles include sole owner and practitioner of a law firm focused on entrepreneurs, coach to her children’s soccer team, and President of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC), an organization providing at-risk youth opportunities for success through job skill training, education and work experience in conservation and service.  As President and Board Chair of LACC, Mercedes is continually inspired by the stories of young adults who give back to their community in a big way despite poverty, adversity and lack of opportunity. At LACC, young adults learn to build parks, maintain natural environments, and remove tons of recyclables from the waste stream.  Whether through work or service, Mercedes is assisting entrepreneurs in building a better future and a stronger California. Banc of California is proud to share her values and support her efforts!

Work gives people pride but education is what opens up people's minds. Those are the two things I'm passionate about.

Mercedes Morton is passionate about entrepreneurs whom she views as innovative, courageous, and the engine of our economic growth. After graduating from Stanford Law School and working for two top law firms in Los Angeles, she changed her career path to balance her time between practicing law, family, and serving others in the community. Now her titles include sole owner and practitioner of a law firm focused on entrepreneurs, coach to her children’s soccer team, and President of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC), an organization providing at-risk youth opportunities for success through job skill training, education and work experience in conservation and service.  As President and Board Chair of LACC, Mercedes is continually inspired by the stories of young adults who give back to their community in a big way despite poverty, adversity and lack of opportunity. At LACC, young adults learn to build parks, maintain natural environments, and remove tons of recyclables from the waste stream.  Whether through work or service, Mercedes is assisting entrepreneurs in building a better future and a stronger California. Banc of California is proud to share her values and support her efforts!
