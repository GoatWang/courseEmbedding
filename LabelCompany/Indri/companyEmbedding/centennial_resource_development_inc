We expect to receive approximately $    million of net proceeds (assuming the
midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) from the
sale of the common stock offered by us after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fully repay
our $65.0 million term loan and the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving
credit facility and the remaining net proceeds to fund our 2016, 2017 and 2018
capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. The following table
illustrates our anticipated use of the net proceeds from this offering:

Our term loan matures on April 15, 2018. Interest on the term loan is LIBOR plus
5.25%. At March 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our term loan
was 5.69%. As of June 30, 2016, we had $     million of outstanding borrowings
and $0.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit
facility. Our revolving credit facility matures October 15, 2019 and bears
interest at a variable rate. At March, 31, 2016, the weighted average interest
rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.44%. We also pay a
commitment fee on unused amounts of our revolving credit facility ranging from
37.5 basis points to 50 basis points, depending on the percentage of the
borrowing base utilized. The outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility were incurred to fund a portion of our 2014, 2015 and 2016 capital
expenditures. We may at any time reborrow amounts repaid under our revolving
credit facility, and we expect to do so in the future to fund our capital
program.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$    per share would cause the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses,
received by us to increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately
$    million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. If the proceeds increase due to
a higher initial public offering price, we would use the additional net proceeds
to fund our 2016, 2017 and 2018 capital expenditures or for general corporate
purposes. If the proceeds decrease due to a lower initial public offering price,
then we would first reduce by a corresponding amount the net proceeds directed
to general corporate purposes and then, if necessary, the net proceeds directed
to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.


The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with
other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only
explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and
refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional,
national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for
productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to
define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and
prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these
companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during
periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated
competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to,
federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which
would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire
additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent
upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have
fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may
be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and
natural gas properties.

There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other
industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be
substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation
considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the
jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of
any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its
effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially
increase the costs of developing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay
the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors
may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state
and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely
affect our competitive position.


Company Description
We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the development and
acquisition of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas
reserves in the Permian Basin. Our assets are concentrated in the Delaware
Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin. Our properties consist of


 large,
contiguous acreage blocks in Reeves, Ward and Pecos counties in West Texas.

As of June 15, 2016, our portfolio included 61 operated producing horizontal
wells. Our horizontal wells span an area approximately 45 miles long by 20 miles
wide where we have established commercial production in five distinct zones: the
3rd Bone Spring Sandstone, Upper Wolfcamp A, Lower Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and
Wolfcamp C. As a result, we have broadly appraised our acreage across various
geographic areas and stratigraphic zones, which we expect will allow us to
efficiently develop our drilling inventory with a focus on maximizing returns to
our stockholders. In addition, we believe our acreage may be prospective for the
2nd and 3rd Bone Spring shales and Avalon Shale, where other operators have
experienced drilling success near our acreage.

We have leased or acquired approximately 42,500 net acres, approximately 83% of
which we operate, as of June 15, 2016. Our acreage is predominantly located in
the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, where production and reserves
typically contain a higher percentage of oil and natural gas liquids and a
correspondingly lower percentage of natural gas compared to the northern portion
of the Delaware Basin. After temporarily suspending drilling activity at the end
of March 2016 to preserve capital, we added one horizontal rig in June 2016 and
expect to add a second horizontal rig in the fourth quarter of 2016. During
2015, we operated, on average, one rig and placed 13 horizontal wells on
production. Our development drilling plan is comprised exclusively of horizontal
drilling with an ongoing focus on reducing drilling times, optimizing
completions and reducing costs.

The Permian Basin is an attractive operating area due to its extensive original
oil-in-place, favorable operating environment, multiple horizontal zones, high
oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, well-developed network of oilfield
service providers, long-lived reserves with relatively consistent reservoir
quality and historically high drilling success rates. According to the Energy
Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy (the “EIA”), the
Permian Basin is the most prolific oil producing area in the United States,
accounting for 23% and 20% of total U.S. crude oil production during the
twelve-month periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015, respectively.

Over the past decade, the Delaware Basin has experienced significant horizontal
drilling. According to Baker Hughes, three of the top six Permian Basin counties
by horizontal rig count are located in the Delaware Basin. Reeves County, where
the majority of our acreage is located, had the second most horizontal rigs of
any U.S. county as of June 17, 2016, with 21 rigs as of such date. As a result
of this horizontal drilling, the Delaware Basin is the only region in the United
States that has experienced sustained fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter
production growth rates greater than 25% for the past three years.

Source: IHS Performance Evaluator as of April 2016.
  
Based on recent well results and significant decreases in drilling and
completion costs, we believe the Delaware Basin represents one of the most
attractive operating regions in the United States. According to data from IHS
Performance Evaluator, in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, wells in the Delaware Basin
had a higher average three-month cumulative initial production per 1,000 feet of
lateral section than wells in the Midland Basin, another sub-basin of the 
Permian Basin. These results are driven primarily by the over-pressured nature
of the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp reservoirs in the Delaware Basin, which enhances
the deliverability of horizontal wells. We believe these results indicate the
Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring formations in the Delaware Basin generate greater
implied EURs per 1,000 feet of lateral length as compared to the Spraberry and
Wolfcamp zones in the Midland Basin.

We were formed by an affiliate of Natural Gas Partners (“NGP”), a family of
energy-focused private equity investments funds. Our goal is to build a premier
development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling in the
Delaware Basin. Our key management and technical team members average
approximately 28 years of experience and have successfully led development
operations in prolific oil basins in the Continental United States, including
horizontal development in the Permian, Bakken and Niobrara plays. This expertise
and technical acumen have been applied to the horizontal drilling and
multi-stage completions on our properties, resulting in drilling success and
continuous operating improvements across multiple zones.

We have assembled a multi-year inventory of horizontal drilling projects. As of
June 15, 2016, we had identified 1,357 gross horizontal drilling locations in
the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone, Upper Wolfcamp A, Lower Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B
and Wolfcamp C zones across our Delaware Basin acreage based on spacing of four
wells per 640-acre section in the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone and five to six
wells per 640-acre section in the Wolfcamp zones. Our drilling inventory
includes 366 extended lateral locations of either 9,500 or 7,500 lateral feet.
Our near-term drilling program is focused on both the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A
zones, but we also intend to drill locations in the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone,
Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp C zones. Based on our and other operators’ well results
and our analysis of geologic and engineering data, we believe the 2nd and 3rd 
Bone Spring shales and Avalon Shale may also be prospective across our acreage,
and we may integrate these zones into our future drilling program as they become
further delineated. The following table provides a summary of our gross
horizontal drilling locations by zone as of June 15, 2016.

                    Total Horizontal Locations(3)(4)     1,357  

(1) Our total identified horizontal drilling locations include 51 locations      
    associated with proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. We have 
    estimated our drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and upon  
    the evaluation of our horizontal drilling results and those of other         
    operators in our area, combined with our interpretation of available 
    geologic and engineering data. In particular, we have analyzed and 
    interpreted well results and other data acquired through our participation 
    in the drilling of vertical wells that have penetrated our horizontal zones. 
    In addition, to evaluate the prospectivity of our horizontal acreage, we 
    have performed open-hole and mud log evaluations, core analysis and drill 
    cuttings analysis. The drilling locations that we actually drill will depend 
    on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, 
    costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities we 
    are able to conduct on these identified locations may not be successful and 
    may not result in our ability to add additional proved reserves to our 
    existing proved reserves. Further, to the extent the drilling locations are 
    associated with acreage that expires, we would lose our right to develop the 
    related locations.                                                             

(2) Our horizontal drilling location count implies 880-foot spacing with five to 
    six wells per 640-acre section in the Wolfcamp zones and 1,320-foot spacing  
    with four wells per 640-acre section in the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone, in    
    each case, consisting primarily of single-section (i.e., approximately       
    4,500-foot) laterals.                                                        

(3) 674 of our 1,357 horizontal drilling locations are on acreage that we        
    operate. We have an approximate 82% average working interest in our operated 
    acreage.                                                                     

(4) We have included undeveloped horizontal locations only on our leasehold in   
    Reeves and Ward counties.                                                    

We believe that development drilling of our 1,357 gross horizontal locations,
with an increasing focus on drilling extended lateral wells as well as potential
downspacing, will allow us to grow our production and reserves. In addition, we
believe our large acreage blocks allow us to optimize our horizontal development
program to maximize our resource recovery and our returns. We also intend to
grow our production and reserves through acquisitions that meet our strategic
and financial objectives. Furthermore, we believe our operational efficiency is
enhanced by a third-party gas gathering system and cryogenic processing plant,
which were built specifically for the area where the majority of our acreage is
located, and our operated saltwater disposal system.

In addition, a third-party crude gathering system, which is expected to be
operational in the third quarter of 2016 and which will transport the majority
of our crude oil to market at a lower cost than we have experienced
historically, will provide additional efficiencies.

We experienced a significant decrease in our drilling and completion costs
during 2015, which has continued into 2016. This trend has been driven by
efficiency improvements in the field, including reduced drilling days, the
modification of well designs and reduction or elimination of unnecessary costs.
Additionally, overall service costs have declined as a result of reduced
industry demand. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the spud-to-rig
release for our three single-section horizontal wells was approximately 22 days
compared to 28 days and 46 days for all single-section horizontal wells we
drilled in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect that further optimization in
the field (including the increased drilling of longer laterals, pad drilling,
the use of shared facilities and zipper fracs), reduced rig rates and lower
service costs will improve our well economics.

Our 2016 capital budget for drilling, completion and recompletion activities and
facilities costs is approximately $87 million, excluding leasing and other
acquisitions. We expect to allocate approximately $72 million of our 2016
capital budget for the drilling and completion of operated wells and $8 million
for our participation in the drilling and completion of non-operated wells. For
2016, we have budgeted $25 million for leasing. In the three months ended
March 31, 2016, we incurred capital costs of approximately $16.5 million,
excluding leasing and acquisition costs.

Because we operate approximately 83% of our net acreage, the amount and timing
of these capital expenditures are largely subject to our discretion. We believe
our approximate 82% average working interest in our operated acreage provides us
with flexibility to manage our drilling program and optimize our returns and
profitability. We could choose to defer a portion of our planned capital
expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including the success of our
drilling activities; prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, natural gas and
NGLs; the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital; the
receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals; drilling,
completion and acquisition costs; and the level of participation by other
working interest owners. We have an approximate 15% working interest in our
non-operated acreage.

For the three months ended March 31, 2016, our average net daily production was
7,212 Boe/d (approximately 71.7% oil, 17.7% natural gas and 10.6% NGLs). The
following table provides summary information regarding our proved reserves as of
December 31, 2015, based on a reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell &
Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent petroleum engineer. Of our proved
reserves, approximately 40% were classified as proved developed producing
(“PDP”). Proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) included in this estimate are from
52 horizontal well locations across three zones.

SailingStone Capital Partners LLC

                                    SailingStone Capital Partners invests client assets primarily in accordance with their Natural Resources Strategy and/or their Natural Gas Strategy. The Natural Resources Strategy invests primarily in equity securities of issuers that the firm considers to be engaged principally in natural resources industries anywhere in the world. These portfolios typically hold a limited number of securities. SailingStone seeks to purchase securities in companies with these characteristics when SailingStone believes the price reflects a limited possibility of permanent capital impairment. SailingStone's Natural Gas Strategy invests in equity securities of companies that produce natural gas in North America or engage in natural gas-related businesses that may benefit from an improvement in long-term natural gas fundamentals. The strategy is concentrated around companies that the firm believes possess a combination of the three attributes required to generate excess returns in a commoditized industry: producing assets which sit at the bottom of a steeply sloped supply cost curve, highly capable management teams with a strong track record of prudent capital allocation and value creation, and a deep inventory of advantaged assets into which capital can be deployed at high rates of return.

Tide Point Capital Management LP

The firm is an opportunistic long/short equity manager that focuses on the materials, industrials, consumer discretionary and energy sectors. Tide Point actively manages both their fund's net and gross exposures, combining fundamental analysis with short-term, tactical trading. They take directional views within the individual industries and sub-sectors, including running a net-short position when appropriate. Tide Point continuously monitors short term changes in stock volatility in order to recognize and quantify real time changes in portfolio risk.
