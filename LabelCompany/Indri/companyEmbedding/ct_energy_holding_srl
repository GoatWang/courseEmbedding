HOUSTON, June 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Harvest Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:   HNR) (Harvest or the Company) today announced that CT Energy Holding SRL, a Venezuelan-Italian consortium, has agreed to purchase from Harvest senior secured notes, convertible notes and warrants. Harvest will immediately receive proceeds of $32.2 million from the sale of the senior secured notes and convertible notes.  Harvest could realize up to $42.5 million in additional proceeds from the full exercise of the warrants, which is subject to stockholder approval. Harvest will use today's proceeds from CT Energy Holding SRL to repay its existing long-term debt and to reposition Harvest for long-term growth, both in Venezuela and Gabon.
Harvest today also announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with CT Energy Holding SRL and CT Energia Holding, Ltd., an international energy trading firm (CT Energia), designed to maximize the long‑term success and value of Harvest's Venezuelan operations and its 20.4% investment in Petrodelta S.A. (Petrodelta). Under the terms of this strategic partnership: 

Harvest has entered into a term sheet with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), Harvest's partner in Petrodelta, for the repositioning and growth of Petrodelta's business; 
Two directors designated by CT Energy Holding SRL and a third, independent director, will join Harvest's board of directors, effective immediately;  
Harvest has agreed to appoint two of CT Energy Holding SRL's designees as Harvest's representatives on the Petrodelta board of directors; 
CT Energia has entered into a management contract to oversee the day-to-day operations of Harvest's Venezuelan business and to assist with the development of a plan for the business operations and financing for Petrodelta and the negotiation of definitive documents to implement such plan; and 
During the term of the management contract, Alessandro Bazzoni, the Chief Executive Officer of CT Energia who has over 15 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, will be appointed Director and General Manager – Venezuelan Operations for Harvest.
In announcing the funding and strategic partnership, Harvest Chief Executive Officer James A. Edmiston said, "CT Energy Holding's funding addresses our liquidity requirements for the near and medium term and will enable us to reinvest in our business, particularly in our Venezuelan operations and in the success of Petrodelta."  Edmiston continued, "Our strategic partnership with CT Energy Holding represents an important step forward in creating and implementing a new model for the operations and financing for Petrodelta, which will benefit all stakeholders. The additional capital will allow us to continue our exploration and development work in our exciting Dussafu Block in Gabon."
Harvest's Chairman of the Board, Stephen D. Chesebro', stated, "We are also delighted to welcome Oswaldo Cisneros, Francisco D'Agostino and Edgard Leal, well-known senior executives with deep knowledge of Venezuela, to our board. We look forward to working with them, as well as Mr. Bazzoni, on repositioning Harvest's Venezuelan operations for growth. I also wish to express, on behalf of Harvest, my deepest appreciation for the past service and contributions of Dr. Igor Effimoff, H. H. Hardee and J. Michael Stinson, who are stepping down from our board today."
Mr. Bazzoni, Chief Executive Officer of CT Energia, commented, "We are excited to partner with Harvest and its management team in the next phase of Harvest's long‑term strategy. We are confident that with this new liquidity and opportunity to reposition its Venezuelan operations, Harvest is well positioned to drive exceptional value for its shareholders as well as the other equityholders of Petrodelta. We see Harvest offering tremendous upside potential and promise, and I look forward to working on a day-to-day basis with Harvest's employees in Venezuela."
Terms of the transaction include:

CT Energy Holding SRL is acquiring a $25.225 million, five year, 15.00% senior secured non-convertible note and a $6.975 million, five year, 9.00% senior secured convertible note. The convertible note is immediately convertible into 8,506,097 shares of Harvest common stock, or approximately 19.9% of Harvest's currently outstanding common stock. Harvest is also issuing to CT Energy Holding SRL 69.75 shares of a newly created series of preferred stock that will entitle the holder to vote on an "as-if" converted basis. 
CT Energy Holding SRL will also acquire a warrant to purchase up to 34,070,820 shares of Harvest's common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. The warrant will become exercisable only after the 30-day volume weighted average price of Harvest's common stock equals or exceeds $2.50 per share and Harvest's stockholders approve the transaction with CT Energy Holding SRL by a majority of votes cast, as required by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shareholder approval rules. The warrant is cash-exercisable, but CT Energy Holding SRL may surrender the non-convertible note to pay for a portion of the aggregate exercise price. 
At its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, which is expected to occur in August of 2015, Harvest stockholders will be asked to approve the transaction under NYSE shareholder approval requirements and to approve an amendment to Harvest's charter to authorize new shares of common stock in an amount sufficient for future needs, including the full conversion of the convertible note and full exercise of the warrant issued in the transaction. 
If stockholder approval is not obtained, CT Energy Holding SRL may elect to accelerate full repayment of the non-convertible and convertible note upon 60-days' notice. Upon acceleration of the notes, Harvest would be required to seek alternative financing for the liquidity and the strategic partnership would be terminated. 
Pro forma for the transaction, CT Energy Holding SRL would own 16.5% of Harvest's common stock outstanding prior to the shareholder approval and 49.9% of common stock outstanding following the shareholder approval and exercise of the warrants. 
Full details of the agreement will be provided in a forthcoming filing on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP acted as legal counsel to Harvest.
D'Agostino & Co. served as financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal counsel to CT Energy Holding SRL.

Harvest will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Monday, June 22, 2015, during which management will discuss the transaction. The conference leader will be James A. Edmiston, President and Chief Executive Officer. To access the conference call, dial 719-325-2454 or 888-471-3843 five to ten minutes prior to the start time. At that time you will be asked to provide the conference number, which is 7502966. A recording of the conference call will also be available for replay at 719-457-0820 or 888-203-1112, passcode 7502966, through June 26, 2015.

Harvest Natural Resources sells out of Venezuela

Posted by         Jordan Blum

Date: June 30, 2016






Financially struggling Harvest Natural Resources is abandoning its presence in Venezuela after focusing heavily on production in the politically unstable nation for more than a decade.
Houston-based Harvest said Thursday it’s selling its Venezuelan stake in a deal close to to $100 million to the Italian-Venezuelan consortium, CT Energy Holding SRL, which had partnered with Harvest last year.
Harvest has struggled to stay afloat the last couple years and is currently facing a potential de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange with its shares trading below $1. On the brighter side,  Harvest’s stock roughly doubled Thursday morning after closing Wednesday at 48 cents per share.
The deal, which is expected to close at the end of September, would leave Harvest only with assets in Indonesia and in Gabon along the African west coast. But Harvest said Thursday it “will also continue to seek opportunities to sell its Gabon assets.”
In the Venezuelan deal, Harvest will receive $80 million in cash, an additional $12 million to be paid over six months, $4.25 million in Harvest stock that was owned by CT Energy, and warrants held by CT to buy up to 34 million Harvest shares. In exchange, Harvest also will pay more than $30 million in outstanding debt to CT Energy at the close of the deal.
Harvest has long held a strong position in Venezuela, but government intrusion has repeatedly caused consternation.
Last year, Harvest CEO said the company faced a “severe liquidity problem” after Venezuela blocked a previous sale of assets there to Argentina’s Pluspetrol.
At the time, Edmiston said he was “disappointed and frustrated” by the government intervention.
Going further back, in 2013, the Indonesian government rejected the $725 million sale of Harvest’s assets sale to that nation’s state-owned PT Pertamina, saying that Harvest had raised its price.
Harvest has suffered from both the dispute over the blocked assets sale and the crude oil price collapse that made its offshore oil prospect in the West African nation of Gabon less attractive.

Apparently Yes!Jun.22.15 | About: Harvest Natural (HNR) Fun Trading Special situations, contrarian, long/short equity, valueSummaryCT Energy Holding SRL, a Venezuelan-Italian consortium, has agreed to purchase from Harvest senior secured notes, convertible notes and warrants.$6.975 million senior secured convertible notes can be immediately converted into 8,506,097 shares of HNR stock, which means that the shares have been valued at $0.82.Harvest also announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with CT Energy Holding SRL and CT Energia Holding designed to maximize its Venezuelan assets.It is hard to come up with a fair valuation here. However, looking at the whole deal, HNR seems overvalued and should retreat.This article is an update to my preceding article on Harvest Natural Resources (NYSE:HNR) published on May 20, 2015.
HNR 3-month chart:

HNR data by YCharts
On June 19, Harvest Natural Resources announced that:
CT Energy Holding SRL, a Venezuelan-Italian consortium, has agreed to purchase from Harvest senior secured notes, convertible notes and warrants. Harvest will immediately receive proceeds of $32.2 million from the sale of the senior secured notes and convertible notes...
1 - CT Energy Holding ("CT") is acquiring:


$25.225 million worth of, five-year, 15.00% senior secured non-convertible notes;

$6.975 million worth of, five-year, 9.00% senior secured convertible notes;
HNR is issuing to CT 69.75 shares of a newly created series of preferred stock that will entitle the holder to vote on an "as-if" converted basis.

The $6.975 million worth of senior secured convertible notes are immediately convertible into 8,506,097 shares of HNR stock, which means that the shares have been valued at $0.82.
HNR's shares outstanding before the deal were worth 42.32 million, and will be climbing to 50.826 million shares if CT exercises it.

Based on HNR's closing price per share on Friday of $1.82, the company is valued at $15.48 million... No comments on that!
2 - CT Energy Holding is also acquiring:
A warrant to purchase up to 34,070,820 shares of HNR at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.

The warrant will become exercisable only after the 30-day volume-weighted average price of Harvest's common stock equals or exceeds $2.50 per share;
And Harvest's stockholders approve the transaction with CT Energy Holding SRL by a majority of votes cast, as required by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shareholder approval rules. The warrant is cash-exercisable, but CT Energy Holding SRL may surrender the non-convertible note to pay for a portion of the aggregate exercise price.
In August of 2015, Harvest stockholders will be asked to approve the transaction and increase common shares.

3 - Harvest has announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with CT Energy Holding SRL and CT Energia Holding designed to maximize its Venezuelan assets.
I will not comment on this part, because I believe it is only wishful thinking that will lead to nowhere again.
What does it mean, using the best-case scenario for CT?
CT will be able to exercise its warrants when the 30-day average of HNR will be equal or above $2.50 after the transaction is approved by the stockholders (which includes CT itself).
Assuming HNR's stock price averages $2.50 for 30 days, CT will exercise its warrants or pay HNR approximately $42.6 million in cash. CT will be able to surrender the $25.225 million note and pay an extra $17.375 million to get the warrants.
The new shares outstanding will, in this case, be worth 85.33 million, and CT may own up to 42.58 million shares, or 49.90%, of HNR.
CT will pay a total of: $22.225 million + $6.975 million + $17.375 million = $46.575 million.
However, if the company decides to convert its 8.506 million shares and sell them at market using Friday's close, it will receive $15.48 million.
If the entire deal is not immediately completed (and it cannot), we should deduct roughly one year's 15% interest on the $22.225 million note, which would work out to $3.333 million.

Thus, CT will pay approximately $27.8 million for 34.074 million shares representing 40% of the total shares outstanding.
Based on what CT is paying, I came up with a best-case scenario at $0.913 per share.
Conclusion:
I have to concede that HNR is a resilient company, as a few weeks ago, I was not betting on the company's survival. Mr. Edminston has come up with a new financial scheme that will give the company a little more time, and time is of the essence.
I do not think anyone believed that CT Energy Holding signed this deal to rescue HNR shareholders, and it seems that HNR gave away much of the Gabon potential - but the company really had no choice.
One unknown is the suspicious trading that preceded this deal, which should be investigated by the SEC. I believe someone related to the parties illegally traded the stock on obvious insider knowledge.
