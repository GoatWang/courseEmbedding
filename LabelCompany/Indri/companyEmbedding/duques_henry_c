 Business Editors/High-Tech Writers

 LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 15, 2002

 Hypercom Corp. (NYSE: HYC) Chairman and Chief Strategist George
Wallner Wednesday awarded Hypercom's 2002 Industry Lifetime
Achievement Award to Henry C. "Ric" Duques, chairman of First
Data (NYSE: FDC), for his extensive contributions to the advancement of
the global transaction automation industry.

 Under Duques' leadership, First Data has become a global
powerhouse in electronic commerce and payment services, with a market
capitalization of more than $30 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in
1992, the year it was first established as an independent, publicly
traded company.

 In addition to his duties as chairman of First Data, Duques is also
the chairman of eONE Global, LP, a leader in emerging payment
technologies for Internet and wireless applications. He serves on the
board of directors of a number of companies, including NYCE, Unisys
Corp., and SunGard. He is also a member of the board of trustees for The
George Washington University.

 "Henry Duques has had an enormous influence on the global
growth of the electronic payments industry. Early in his career he
recognized how significant payment cards and electronic payments would
become, and he has led his company, and indeed the entire industry,
since then.

 "He has directed First Data's growth from a processor
with origins in the old regional bank card processing associations to a
multi-billion dollar global giant with operations spanning virtually
every segment of the industry. He is consistently on the cutting edge.

 "He is clearly an industry visionary, an undisputed leader,
and a formidable and highly respected business executive with a sense of
purpose and direction that few if any can match.

 "It is my honor and privilege to present Henry C. `Ric'
Duques with the Hypercom 2002 Industry Lifetime Achievement Award,"
Wallner said in remarks to more than 450 partner organizations,
customers, value-added resellers and distributors at Hypercom's
largest ever annual Global Partners Conference in Las Vegas.

 "All of you gathered today, together with the management and
employees of First Data, eONE Global, and those of the stellar companies
also represented here, are firmly committed to making commerce easier,
more efficient and more secure for consumers and organizations here in
the U.S. and around the world. That has been my primary goal since day
one.

 "It requires an extraordinary effort by many," Duques
said. "And, I know that I speak for George and everyone here when I
say that we look forward with energy, enthusiasm and dedication to
future challenges and opportunities."

 "Thank you for this award. I am honored. Thank you also for
inviting me here to be with you. And I also want to thank and
congratulate every one of you for the tremendous difference that you are
making to the electronic payments industry, and all of those who we
serve," Duques said.

 The Hypercom Lifetime Achievement Award Ceremony at the Hard Rock
Hotel caps an intensive two-day conference attended by more than 450
electronic payment experts from more than 100 countries.

 The conference included presentations by leaders in global
electronics who reported on advances in practical biometrics for the
point-of-sale (POS), smart cards, quick service, m-commerce, networking,
electronic signature and receipt capture, on-screen card payment
terminal advertising, traditional and non-traditional POS markets,
pre-paid products and services, government Electronic Benefits Transfer,
and healthcare, among others.
