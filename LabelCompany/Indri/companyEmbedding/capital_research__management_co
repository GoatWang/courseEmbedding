Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Investment Firm Adds 44 Million Shares of Avon to Portfolio

By Paul Ausick July 10, 2015 1:35 pm EDT

In a Schedule 13G filed Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Capital Research Global Investors, a division of investment firm Capital Research and Management Company, revealed that it has raised its stake in Avon Products Inc. (NYSE: AVP) to 48,993,600 shares as of June 30, 2015. At the end of March, Capital Research reported ownership of 4,875,300 shares of Avon stock.
Capital Research now owns 11.3% of Avon’s outstanding stock. The filing does not indicate how much the firm paid for the stock, but at Thursday’s closing price of $5.97 per share, the value of Capital Research’s holdings is nearly $294 million. It is probably safe to assume that the investment firm paid less than that for the stock. 


The news follows by a day the announcement by Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY) that it purchased Procter & Gamble Co.’s (NYSE: PG) cosmetics brands for $12.5 billion. Before coming public in 2013, Coty offered to acquire Avon for something more than $10 billion, an offer that Avon refused as being inadequate. Avon’s market value today is around $2.6 billion.
Earlier this week, Avon sold its U.K.-based Liz Earle cosmetics brand to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ: WBA) for about $216 million.
While no further announcements have been forthcoming from either Avon or Capital Research, it is a fair bet that we will be hearing something any day now.
Avon shares traded down about 1% to a new 52-week low of $5.90 on Friday. The 52-week high was $14.49.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.

Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?

We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

Choosing the Right Property Manager

Choosing the right property management company from among the dozens in your area can seem like a daunting task. But with some careful planning and good interview techniques, you'll be well on your way to turning the complex, time-consuming job of managing your rental property into a passive (for you) revenue stream.
Before deciding which companies to put on your short list, sit down and identify your needs and goals for the property in question. Do you need full property management services, or do you want help with only certain aspects of your business, such as leasing? Do you need a manager to live on-site? Would you prefer to work with a large company that has multiple locations and lots of resources, or would you rather work with a more boutique business, where you'll likely receive more personal attention?
Once you've decided on your criteria and narrowed your search, take a close look at the following aspects of any property management companies who make your final cut:

Company focus: While many property management companies are willing to take on a variety of property types, it's also not uncommon for a company to have an area of particular expertise, or to heavily preference managing certain property types. It's also not uncommon for a property management company to focus heavily on a particular skill set, such as marketing properties
, providing regular inspections, or handling the administrative aspects of running an income property. When you're evaluating a property management company, you'll want to make sure that your interests and those of the company are aligned.

Management systems: Regardless of how long they've been in business, a good property manager will be able to easily describe her proven methods for securing payments, performing routine maintenance, complying with regulations, handling emergencies, 
resolving disputes, and other critical tasks.


Cost structure Good property management companies will make it easy for you to understand what the total monthly cost of their services will be. When you're reviewing the contract, make sure you understand what tasks are included in the stated monthly, hourly, or project-based fee, and look out for excessive potential additional charges.

Availability: Like it or not, property management is a 24/7 undertaking. The company you're looking at should have plans in place for handling any emergencies that arise outside of standard office hours.

Customer service: Keep in mind that your property management team will not only be servicing you, they'll be representing you when dealing with your customers, the tenants of your property. If they lack professionalism or attentiveness in this area, it will cost you money in the end. If you can, observe the company you're interviewing in action, and be sure to get familiar with their customer service policies.
