Our clinic focuses on treating the correction of spinal misalignment (vertebral subluxation) and soft tissue problems that are associated with it which is the primary cause for the disc herniation, disc generation and spinal degeneration.  And these conditions affect millions of people in the US: In general disc and spinal degeneration are known as arthritis.  This same problem also affects many professional athletes and interferes with their performance and cause frequent injuries.   At Orange County Mission Chiropractic, we don't just treat the symptoms.  We treat the root cause of the problem for patients so that they can avoid unnecessary surgery and improve performance.  Dr. Kim does the proper consultation of the patient's history and takes full spine x-rays to find out the root cause of the problem and apply very specific spinal adjustment based on x-ray findings associated with the specific soft tissue treatment.  Dr. Kim has had great success in treating patients with disc herniation, disc generation, spinal degeneration and sports injuries. Conditions we treat here at our office are disc herniation, disc degeneration, spinal degeneration (spinal arthritis), numbness and tingling and shooting pain or sensation in the upper and lower extremities, sports injuries, scoliosis, acute/chronic neck and back pain, tennis elbow, frozen shoulder, knee pain, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, migraine, and dizziness and vertigo, etc.  Dr. Kim is currently to become a Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician (CCSP), Diplomat American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians (DACBSP) and Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT).  Please see testimonials of the patients at my clinic.

Product Attributes and Models of Multiple Discreteness

Date Written: February 2006

Abstract
Demand for product characteristics is examined within the context of models that allow for both corner and interior solutions corresponding to zero and non-zero demand.  Product attribute information is associated with marginal utility and curvature (satiation) parameters of various utility functions. Empirical applications demonstrate the need for incorporating characteristics in a fairly general way.  We also compare our approach to an ideal point and pure Lancasterian versions of our nonlinear utility model.  The data support our model over either the ideal point or Lancasterian variants.  



Keywords: multiple discreteness, demand models, characteristics models
