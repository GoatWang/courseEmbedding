	BOE/D






	 



	SAN ANTONIO,
	TEXAS – May 16, 2017 –

	Lilis Energy, Inc. (NYSE MKT: LLEX), an exploration and development company operating in
	the Permian Basin of West Texas, today announced a year-to-date operations and corporate update.



	 



	Avi Mirman, Lilis’s Chief Executive
	Officer, commented: “2017 continues on a rapid pace for Lilis, with goals exceeded both operationally and financially. Sequential
	average daily production jumped from 350 to 1,630 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (12/31/16 – 5/8/17) – an increase
	of about 365% in four and a-half months. We believe the wells we are drilling are among the best in the country on a BOE per lateral
	foot basis. As such, we reaffirm our December exit rate production target of between 5,000 – 5,300 net BOE per day.


	 


	"In addition to these strong operational
	results, in April 2017, we successfully completed term loan financings with up to $140 million of availability, making us well
	positioned to execute on our 2017 drilling and acreage acquisition plans in the Delaware Basin of the Permian, where we have already
	surpassed our initial acreage target of 10,000 net acres as of last month. We acquired 7,685 gross, 4,344 net acres in the first
	four months of the year, and plan to expand our leasehold footprint judiciously and opportunistically during the remainder of the
	year. Our recently announced financings have enabled us to recapitalize and strengthen our balance sheet to support our continued
	growth, said Mr. Mirman.


	 


	Mr. Mirman added: “Initial production
	rates on the Bison #1H and the Grizzly #1H, the first two wells of our Delaware Basin development program have yielded results
	above our original expectations. Management expects the remainder of our program to have similar results as the Bison #1H
	and the Grizzly #1H. Equally impressive is the stability of the production profiles of the Bison #1H and the Grizzly #1H, which
	reached peak 60-day production rates of 1,576 and 1,016 net BOE per day, respectively, or 74% and 77%, of their peak 30-day rates. Cumulative
	net production from the Bison #1H and the Grizzly #1H through April 30, 2017 was 124,000 BOE and 65,000 BOE, during the first 102
	and 71 days of production, respectively.


	 






	 





	 




	 


	"Year to date, we have drilled four
	wells and completed three wells. The third well, the Hippo, is flowing back, and the fourth, the Lion, will be completed
	this week. We plan to drill 11 gross, 9 net, wells in total this year. Given our cost performance to date, we expect our total
	2017 drilling and completion capital spending will remain within our anticipated target of approximately $50 million. While we
	anticipate that our drilling capital expenditures in 2017 will exceed cash flow, we expect to have sufficient access to capital
	to fund the balance through availability under our recent financings,” continued Mr. Mirman. “Looking ahead to 2018,
	we anticipate adding a second rig to our development program early in the year. A two-rig program would allow us to spud approximately
	20 gross, 16 net, wells. Assuming commodity price levels remain consistent, we expect that the majority of our 2018 Delaware
	Basin drilling program will be funded from internally generated cash flow.”


	 



	Financial Update



	 


	The Company has successfully tapped incremental
	sources of capital and expanded its liquidity since the beginning of this year, most recently closing on up to $140 million of
	availability under term loan credit facilities, including a second lien facility with $80 million drawn, a first lien facility
	with $15 million drawn and access to up to an additional $45 million in delayed-draw term loans. After giving effect to the repayment
	of $38.1 million in outstanding debt under the Company’s first lien term loan, the financings resulted in immediate proceeds
	of $56.6 million in cash for the Company. Including available draws under the discretionary, delayed-draw term loan, which is accessible
	to fund certain leasing activity and acreage acquisitions, as of May 15, 2017, the Company would have cash on hand of approximately
	$98 million.


	 


	Also, on May 9, the Company’s common
	stock commenced trading on the NYSE MKT, where it continues to trade under the ticker LLEX.


	 


	Joe Daches, Lilis’s Chief Financial
	Officer, stated, “We have been able to achieve meaningful milestones since the beginning of the year in the Company’s
	plan to create shareholder value. We expect the incremental capital accessed by the Company since March 31, 2017 will fully fund
	the approved 2017 capital budget. In addition, management and the Board believe that LLEX’s transition to the NYSE MKT will
	increase its visibility to energy investors and trading liquidity.


	 


	“In addition, the recent financings
	have been accompanied by significant strides in simplifying the Company’s balance sheet. As part of our recent financing
	transactions, we also redeemed 100% of the Company’s Conditionally Redeemable Preferred Stock and converted 100% of the Company’s
	Series B Preferred Stock into common stock. Finally, since January 1, 2017, holders of approximately 3.7 million warrants have
	exercised their right to receive common stock, including the holders of 100% of ‘penny’ warrants,” Mr. Daches
	said.


	 



	Statement of Operations for March 31,
	2017



	 


	As reported in the Company’s Form
	10-Q filed on Friday, May 12, 2017, Lilis reported total revenue was approximately $3.2 million for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.04 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing an increase of approximately
	$3.2 million. The higher revenues were primarily driven by an increase in production from the Company’s Delaware Basin properties.


	 


	Production costs were approximately $0.9
	million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to approximately $0.04 million for the three months ended March 31,
	2016, an increase of approximately $0.5 million. Production costs per BOE decreased to $11.02 for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 from $20.96 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $9.94 per BOE, or 47%. The decrease in production
	costs per BOE was primarily due to costs associated with the producing wells in the Delaware Basin, which have significantly lower
	per unit operating costs than the DJ Basin.


	 


	Production taxes were approximately $0.1
	million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to approximately $0.002 million for the three months ended March 31,
	2016, an increase of approximately $0.1 million.  Production taxes per BOE increased to $1.68 per BOE during the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 from $1.08 during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

	Operations Update



	 



	Permian Basin Acquisition: Lea County,
	NM



	 


	In April 2017, the Company completed the
	acquisition of 640 net leasehold acres in Lea County, New Mexico, through a highly accretive farm-in opportunity. The transaction
	gives Lilis an expanded footprint in Lea County, where the Company currently operates one well. Lilis plans to drill two wells
	on this acreage in the second quarter of 2017. Including the farm-in, Lilis has increased its leasehold position in the Delaware
	Basin from approximately 5,700 net acres to over 10,000 net acres since January 1, 2017, representing an increase of over 76%. Lilis
	expects to continue building its position in the Delaware Basin to effectively meet and exceed internal development goals

	.
