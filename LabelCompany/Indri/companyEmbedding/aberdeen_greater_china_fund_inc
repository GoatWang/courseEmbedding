		                                    Aberdeen Greater China Fund, Inc. (NYSE: GCH)
A concentrated portfolio of securities listed
in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.





















								Investment Objective




The Fund’s investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investment in listed equity securities of companies that (i) are organized under the laws of, and have their principal place of business in, China and/or Hong Kong and/or Taiwan; or (ii) during their most recent fiscal year derived at least 50% of their revenues or profits from goods produced or sold, investments made or services performed in China and/or Hong Kong and/or Taiwan or have at least 50% of their assets in China and/or Hong Kong and/or Taiwan.
Investment Policies
Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets will be invested in listed equity securities of China companies.
The information contained above provides only a brief summary description of the Fund's investment objective and investment policies.
For more detailed information on the specific risks associated with this Fund, please view the Fund’s Important Risk Considerations.

Factsheet
Commentary

Risk Considerations
International investing entails special risk considerations, including currency ﬂuctuations, lower liquidity, economic and political risks, and differences in accounting methods; these risks are generally heightened for emerging market investments.
Concentrating investments in the China region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds.
Equity stocks of small and mid-cap companies carry greater risk, and more volatility than equity stocks of larger, more established companies.

Important InformationAberdeen Asset Management Inc. has prepared this report based on information sources believed to be accurate and reliable.  However, the figures are unaudited and neither the Fund, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the Investment Manager), nor any other person guarantees their accuracy.  Investors should seek their own professional advice and should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before acting on this information. 
Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the "Investment Manager") and Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the "Administrator") are each a subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC ("Aberdeen PLC").  On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a merger ("Merger"). The Boards of each of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC believe that the Merger has a compelling strategic and financial rationale through combining complementary strengths to create a world-class investment group. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger.  In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
Total return figures with distributions reinvested at the dividend reinvestment price are stated net-of-fees and represents past performance.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, current performance may be higher or lower.  Holdings are subject to change and are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities shown.  Inception date July 23, 1992.

	PROXY STATEMENT






	GENERAL





	This Proxy Statement (the Proxy Statement) is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Aberdeen Greater China Fund, Inc. (the Fund) for
	use at the Funds annual meeting of stockholders, to be held at the offices of Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., 712 Fifth Avenue, 49



	th



	Floor (entrance on 56



	th



	Street), New York, New York 10019 on June 9, 2014, at 1:30 p.m., and at any adjournments thereof.




	This Proxy Statement, the notice of annual meeting and the proxy card are first being mailed to stockholders on or about
	April 21, 2014. All properly executed proxies received in time for the meeting will be voted as specified in the proxy or, if no specification is made, according to the recommendation of the Funds Board of Directors for each proposal referred
	to in this Proxy Statement. Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or by submitting a notice of revocation to the Funds Secretary or by voting in person at
	the meeting.




	Holders of record of the common stock of the Fund at the close of business on March 24, 2014, will be entitled
	to one vote per share on all business of the meeting and any adjournments. There are 9,199,253 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 24, 2014. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as defined below), if any, are counted for
	purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be counted as votes cast with respect to any proposal, including the election of directors. Because the election of directors requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of votes
	cast, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the result of the vote for the election of directors. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker or nominee for which an executed proxy is received by the Fund, but are not
	voted as to one or more proposals because instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power. Stockholders of the Fund do not have cumulative
	voting rights or rights of appraisal.








	PROPOSAL 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS





	The Funds Board of Directors has been divided into three classes and the term of one class expires each year. The terms of Messrs.
	John A. Bult, C. William Maher and Jonathan J.K. Taylor, constituting Class II directors, expire at the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. John A. Bult has determined not to stand for reelection. The Board of Directors thanks him for
	his service. Messrs. C. William Maher and Jonathan J.K. Taylor are standing for reelection as Class II directors.




	Persons named in the accompanying form of proxy intend, in the absence of contrary instructions, to vote all proxies in favor of
	(i) the election of the two nominees listed below as directors of the Fund to serve as Class II directors of the Fund for a term expiring on the date of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, or until their successors are duly elected
	and qualified. All nominees have consented to stand for reelection and to serve if elected. If any such nominee




	 




	1







	should be unable to serve, an event not now anticipated, the proxies will be voted for such person, if any, as shall be designated by the Board of Directors to replace any such nominee. YOUR
	FUNDS DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR OF THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES LISTED BELOW.





	CLASS II





	C. William Maher




	Jonathan J.K. Taylor





	Required Vote





	Election of each of the listed nominees for director requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting in
	person or by proxy, which means that the two nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast will be elected regardless of whether the number of votes received by any such nominee constitutes a majority of the number of votes cast.


	Your
	Funds directors recommend that stockholders vote for the two director nominees.

	Leadership Structure, Role in Risk Oversight and Qualifications of the Board of Directors





	The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of the Fund. The Fund has engaged the Investment Manager to manage the Fund on a
	day-to-day basis. The Board oversees the Investment Manager and certain other principal service providers in the operations of the Fund. The Board of Directors is currently composed of six directors, all of whom are independent directors. The Board
	meets in-person at regularly scheduled meetings at least two times throughout the year. In addition, the directors may meet in-person or by telephone at special meetings or on an informal basis at other times. As described below, the Board of
	Directors has established five standing committees  Executive, Audit, Discount Oversight, Governance and Nominating, and Management Engagement  and may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time, to assist the Board
	of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.




	The Board of Directors is chaired by an independent director. As
	chair, this independent director leads the Board of Directors in its activities. The directors have determined that the Board of Directors leadership and committee structure is appropriate because the Board of Directors believes it sets the
	proper tone for the relationships between the Fund, on the one hand, and the Investment Manager and certain other principal service providers, on the other, and facilitates the exercise of the Boards independent judgment in evaluating and
	overseeing the relationships. In addition, the structure efficiently allocates responsibility among committees.




	The Board of
	Directors has concluded that, based on each directors experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other directors, each director should serve as a director. Among other
	attributes common to all directors are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the various service providers to the Fund, and to exercise reasonable business
	judgment in the performance of their duties as directors. In addition, the Board of Directors has taken into account the actual service and commitment of the directors during their tenure in concluding that each should continue to serve. A
	directors ability to perform his or her duties effectively may have been attained through a directors educational background or professional training; business, consulting, public service or academic positions; experience from service as
	a director of the Fund, other funds in the fund complex, public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations; or other experiences. Also, set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or
	skills of each director that led the Board of Directors to conclude that he or she should serve as a director.




	Investing in
	general and the operation of a fund involve a variety of risks, such as investment risk, compliance risk, and operational risk, among others. The Board of Directors oversees risk as part of its oversight of the Fund. Risk oversight is addressed as
	part of various regular Board of Directors and committee activities. The Board of Directors, directly or through its committees, reviews reports from among others, the Investment Manager, the Funds chief compliance officer, the Funds
	independent registered public accounting firm, and counsel, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and the risk management programs of the Investment Manager and certain service providers. The actual day-to-day risk management with
	respect to the Fund resides with the

	Executive Committee






	The Board of Directors has an Executive Committee that currently consists of Messrs. Maher, Taylor and Hawkins. Following the completion
	of the 2014 annual meeting, the Executive Committee will remain unchanged. Each current and prospective member of the Executive Committee is not an interested person of the Fund or of the Investment Manager within the meaning of
	Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (a non-interested director). The Executive Committee is authorized to exercise the general powers of the Board of Directors between meetings of the Board. The Executive Committee met twice during the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.






	Audit Committee






	The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee that currently consists of Messrs. Hawkins, Maher, and Taylor. Following the completion of
	the 2014 annual meeting, the Audit Committee will remain unchanged. Each current and prospective member of the Audit Committee (i) is a non-interested director and (ii) meets the independence requirements of Rule

	10A-3(b)(1)

	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Board has determined that Messrs. Maher and Hawkins are each an audit committee financial expert under the applicable standards set
	forth in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.









	Audit Committee Report






	The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee consisting of Messrs. Hawkins, Maher, and Taylor, each of whom (i) is not an
	interested person of the Fund or of the Investment Manager within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and (ii) meets the independence requirements of Rule

	10A-3(b)(1)

	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The Audit Committee has a charter, a copy of which is
	available on the Funds web site at http://www.aberdeengch.com.




	 




	10







	The function of the Audit Committee is to oversee the Funds accounting and financial
	reporting processes, which includes the selection, retention, compensation and termination of the Funds independent registered public accounting firm. In connection therewith, the Audit Committee reviews with management and the Funds
	independent registered public accounting firm, among other things, the scope of the independent registered accounting firms audit of the Funds financial statements, reviews and discusses the Funds annual audited financial
	statements with management, reviews the independent registered public accounting firms required communications regarding the scope and results of the audit, reviews and approves in advance the type of services to be rendered by the independent
	registered public accounting firm, reviews matters related to the independence of the Funds independent registered public accounting firm and in general considers and reports to the Board on matters regarding the Funds accounting and
	financial reporting processes.




	In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on February 10, 2014, the Audit
	Committee reviewed and discussed the Funds audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 with management of the Fund and the Funds independent registered public accounting firm and discussed the audit of
	such financial statements with the independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accountants the matters required to be discussed by SAS 61 (Codification of Statements on
	Auditing Standards, AU Section 380). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence
	Discussions with Audit Committees) and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence.




	The
	members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing, including in respect of auditor independence or internal controls
	notwithstanding the fact that one or more members may be designated an audit committee financial expert. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made
	by management or the independent registered public accountants. Accordingly, the Audit Committees oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate financial reporting principles and
	policies, or internal controls, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committees considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the
	audit of the Funds financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the
	Funds independent registered public accounting firm is in fact independent.




	Based on its consideration of
	the audited financial statements and the discussions and reports referred to above with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set
	forth in the Audit Committee Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the




	 




	11







	Board of Directors of the Fund that the Funds audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 be included in the Funds annual report to stockholders for
	the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.

	Discount Oversight Committee






	The Board has a Discount Oversight Committee that currently consists of Messrs. Bult, Hawkins, Sell and Maher. Following the completion
	of the 2014 annual meeting, the Discount Oversight Committee will consist of Messrs. Hawkins, Maher and Sell. Each current and prospective member of the Discount Oversight Committee is a non-interested director. The Discount Oversight Committee did
	not meet during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The Discount Oversight Committee is responsible for monitoring the discount at which the Funds shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange from the Funds net asset value per
	share.






	Governance and Nominating Committee






	The Board has a Governance and Nominating Committee that currently consists of Messrs. Bult, Sell, Hawkins, Taylor and Tsim. Following the completion of the 2014 annual meeting, the Governance and
	Nominating Committee will consist of Messrs. Hawkins, Sell, Taylor and Tsim. Each current and prospective member of the Governance and Nominating Committee is a non-interested director. The Governance and Nominating Committee met twice during the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The Governance and Nominating Committee has a charter, a copy of which is available on the Funds website at http://www.aberdeengch.com.




	The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Board of Directors,
	selecting or recommending that the Board select the Funds nominees to be submitted to the stockholders for election as directors of the Fund each year or, if applicable, at a special meeting of stockholders. In the case of a vacancy in the
	office of a director, the Governance and Nominating Committee may recommend a nominee to fill such vacancy either through appointment by the Board of Directors or through election by stockholders. The Governance and Nominating Committee is also
	responsible for reviewing with the Board the requisite skills and criteria for new Board members as well as the composition of the Board as a whole.




	The Governance and Nominating Committee has used an informal process to identify potential candidates for nomination as directors. Candidates for nomination have been recommended by existing directors,
	and considered by the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors.




	 




	12







	The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders,
	provided that such recommendations are made in writing to Megan Kennedy, the Secretary of the Fund, c/o Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc. 1735 Market St., 32nd Floor Philadelphia, PA 19103. Each recommendation should include a personal biography of
	the suggested nominee, an indication of the background or experience that qualifies the person for consideration and a statement that the person has agreed to serve if nominated and elected. Nominees will be evaluated based on the criteria set forth
	in the Governance and Nominating Committee Charter, which provides that the Governance and Nominating Committee will take into consideration the criteria approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund, including, but not limited to, the
	candidates personal and professional integrity, business judgment, relevant experience and skills (including experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity and size and subject to similar legal
	restrictions and oversight), the existence of conflicts of interest, the potential to be an effective director on the Board and any committees of the Board and other factors that the Governance and Nominating Committee considers appropriate. When
	assessing a candidate for nomination the Committee also considers whether the individuals background, skills, and experience will complement the background, skills and experience of other nominees and will contribute to the diversity of the
	Board. The evaluation process does not depend on the source of the recommendation. The relevant dates and other pertinent information for the submission of stockholder proposals for the following years annual meeting of stockholders are set
	forth below under Other MattersStockholder Proposals.






	Management Engagement Committee






	The Board of Directors has a Management Engagement Committee consisting of Messrs. Hawkins, Maher, and Tsim. Each member of the

	on behalf of the Board of Directors, the performance of the Investment Manager and related matters.

	#01-01,

	Capital Square Two, Singapore 049480, is a Singapore corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, with its
	principal office located at 10 Queens Terrace, Aberdeen, United Kingdom AB10 1YG.

	Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc. serves as the Funds administrator as of the close of
	business February 14, 2014. The administrators offices are located at 1735 Market St., 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.





	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance





	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act as applied to the Fund require the Funds officers and directors, persons who
	beneficially own more than 10 percent of a registered class of the Funds own equity securities and certain other persons to file reports of ownership of the Funds securities and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Based solely upon its review of the copies of such forms furnished to it, and written representations from certain reporting persons that no reports on Form 5 were required for those persons, during the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the Fund believes that all filings applicable to the Funds officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders required for such fiscal year were made.





	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

	independent registered public accounting firm to audit the accounts of the Fund for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. KPMG served as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Funds accounts for the fiscal year
	ended December 31, 2013. The Board does not know of any direct or indirect financial interest of KPMG in the Fund. Representatives of KPMG are not expected to be present at the 2014 annual meeting.

	Audit Committee Pre-approval Policies and Procedures






	The
	Funds Audit Committee pre-approves in advance at regularly scheduled Audit Committee meetings all audit and non-audit services (to the extent that such service directly affects the financial reporting or operations of the Fund) performed by
	the Funds independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund, the Investment Manager, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Manager that provides ongoing services to the Fund. If such a
	service is required between regularly scheduled audit meetings, pre-approval may be authorized by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The




	 




	17







	Chairman will update the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of any interim approval granted.






	Services Approved Pursuant to Paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X






	There were no services included in Audit Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees above that were approved by the Funds Audit Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of

	Rule 2-01

	For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and
	December 31, 2012, the aggregate fees for non-audit services rendered on behalf of the Fund (Covered Services), its investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser

	During the past fiscal year, there were no Covered Services or Non-covered Services required to be
	considered by the Funds Audit Committee under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the Audit Committee was not required to consider whether the provision of any Covered Services or Non-covered Services by KPMG
	would be compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG.





	OTHER MATTERS





	The Board of Directors is not aware of any other business to be brought before the meeting other than as set forth above. If, however,
	any other matters properly come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy form to vote such proxies on such matters in accordance with their discretion.





	Miscellaneous





	Proxies
	will be solicited by mail and may be solicited in person or by telephone by directors or officers of the Fund or personnel of Computershare, Inc., the Funds transfer agent. The Fund expects that broker-dealer firms holding shares of the Fund
	in street name for their customers will request voting instructions from their customers and beneficial owners. If these instructions are not received by the date specified in the broker-dealer firms proxy solicitation materials,
	the Fund understands that New York Stock Exchange rules permit the broker-dealers to vote on the proposal for election of directors on behalf of their customers and beneficial owners. For election of directors, certain broker-dealers may exercise
	discretion over shares held in their name for which no instructions are received by voting these shares in the same proportion as they vote shares for which they received instructions.




	 




	18







	A majority of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, will
	constitute a quorum at the meeting. The shares over which broker-dealers have discretionary voting power, the shares that represent broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not
	been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter), and the shares whose proxies reflect an abstention on any item will all be
	counted as shares present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether the required quorum of shares exists.




	In
	the event that sufficient votes in favor of any proposal set forth in the notice of this meeting are not received by June 9, 2014, the persons named as attorneys in the enclosed proxy may propose one or more adjournments of the meeting to permit
	further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the session of the meeting to be adjourned. The persons named as attorneys in the
	enclosed proxy will vote in favor of such adjournment those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of the proposal for which further solicitation of proxies is to be made. They will vote against any such adjournment those proxies required
	to be voted against such proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be counted or voted for purposes of, and accordingly will have no effect on the outcome of, a vote to adjourn the meeting. The costs of any such additional solicitation
	and of any adjourned session will be borne by the Fund.





	The Funds annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year
	ended December 31, 2013, was mailed to stockholders on or about February 28, 2014. The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its 2013 annual report and the most recent semiannual report succeeding that annual report, if any, to any
	stockholder upon request.

	Requests should be directed to the Funds administrator, Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc.; telephone: 866-839-5205.








	Stockholder Proposals





	Stockholder proposals intended to be presented at
	the Funds 2015 annual meeting of stockholders of the Fund must be received by the Fund on or before December 12, 2014 in order to be included in the Funds Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting.




	In addition, the Funds By-Laws provide that if a stockholder of record entitled to vote desires to bring proposals (including
	Director nominations) before the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, written notice of such proposals as prescribed in the By-Laws must be received by the Funds Secretary, Megan Kennedy, Secretary of the Fund, c/o Aberdeen Asset Management,
	Inc. 1735 Market St., 32nd Floor Philadelphia, PA 19103, not later than February 9, 2015 nor earlier than January 10, 2015. Written notice must include a brief description of the business to be brought before the annual meeting, the
	reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the proposing stockholder and any material interest of the proposing stockholder in the proposed business and must otherwise
	comply with the requirements of the Funds By-Laws. However, in the event that the date of the 2015 annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of the 2014 annual meeting, notice by a
	stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 150th day prior to the date of 2015 annual meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the later of the 120th day prior to




	 




	19







	the date of such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement (as defined in the Funds By-Laws) of the date of such meeting is first made by the Fund.




	Stockholders are advised to refer to the By-Laws, a current copy of which may be obtained without charge upon request from
	the Funds Secretary.




	The mere submission of a proposal or notice of proposal by a stockholder does not guarantee that
	such proposal will be included in the Funds proxy statement or otherwise considered at such annual meeting because certain federal rules of the SEC and the Funds By-Laws, respectively, must be complied with before consideration of the
	proposal is required.





	Important Notice Regarding Delivery of Shareholder Documents





	In accordance with a notice sent to certain street name stockholders who share a single address, only one copy of this Proxy
	Statement is being sent to that address unless we received contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. This practice, known as householding, is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. However, if any
	shareholder residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate copy of this Proxy Statement, he or she may contact their broker, and we will deliver those documents to such shareholder promptly upon receiving the request. If you are receiving
	multiple copies of our annual report and proxy statement, you may request householding in the future by contacting your broker.





	Stockholder Communications





	The Board of Directors has a process for stockholders of the Fund to send communications to it. Any stockholder that wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors or a specific director may do so by
	submitting correspondence in writing to the Fund administrator, Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc. 1735 Market St., 32nd Floor Philadelphia, PA 19103, referencing the Fund and specifying the intended addressee. Stockholder communications addressed to
	the Board of Directors will be forwarded promptly after receipt to the Chairman of the Board for review. The Chairman will review each such communication in order to determine whether the communication should be relayed directly to each Board
	member. Stockholder communications that the Chairman determines involve routine matters will be forwarded to the Funds administrator and/or officers of the Fund for review and response, and the Chairman will report to the full Board, as
	appropriate, on the nature and substance of such communications. Stockholder communications that the Chairman determines involve non-routine matters will be forwarded to each member of the Board for review. Stockholder communications addressed to a
	specific director will be forwarded to the addressee promptly upon receipt.




	By order of the Board of
	Directors,

China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95% for CHAU and 0.80% for CHAD. The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2017, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% for CHAU, and 0.80% for CHAD, other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.

China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.
