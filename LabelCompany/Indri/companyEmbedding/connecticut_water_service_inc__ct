Single-serve or bulk water? Choosing the  best option.
Thanks to their efficiency and lightweight packaging, single-serve bottles have proven a convenient and popular refreshment option for hydration on the go. The trade-off? Less water stored compared to its larger cousins.
On the other hand, our 3- and 5-gallon bottles have a much greater storage capacity, thanks to their larger size. Made of a strong polycarbonate plastic, the bottles are cleaned, sanitized and reused up to fifty times.

Should I use a water dispenser?
How much you consume is key. If you drink a lot of water, it would probably make sense. Water dispensers are great for bulk water products like returnable bottles, and they’re also environmentally friendly! The type of water dispenser you choose depends on a few factors including available space and convenience. 
Convenience: If you rent your dispenser from us, we will handle any repairs and/or replacements at no additional cost to you. That’s something worth considering!

How do I contact my delivery person (RSR - Route Sales Representative) ? You can reach your delivery person by leaving a note on the day of your delivery.  Simply attach the note with your request or question on an empty bottle.  If your timing is more urgent, please send an email message to customerservice@dsservices.com, which will be forwarded to your delivery person within two business days or call customer service at 1-800-728-5508. 



What are the benefits of Auto Pay?Setting up your credit or debit card with our easy Auto Pay service means one less check to write and mail each month, and more convenience for you.  Your card will be automatically charged or debited each billing period for your service on the date your invoice is created so you never have to worry about missing a payment.  Less paper and print are also great for the environment!  It's easy. Simply login to your account, go to the "My Account" tab and click the "Manage Auto Pay" button.  Select a credit/debit card to sign up for Auto Pay or enter new credit/debit card information.



When is my payment due?Payment is due by the Payment Due Date listed on your invoice.  Late charges will apply as noted on the payment stub at the bottom right corner of the invoice and as set forth in your customer service agreement with us.



What does "current balance" mean?Your current balance is your total outstanding balance, except for credits or changes processed today.  Your current balance and invoice balance may be different if order or delivery activity has occurred between your last invoice date and today.



What does "invoice balance" mean?Your invoice balance includes charges and credits applied during the billing period covered by the invoice.  Your invoice balance and current balance may be different if order or delivery activity has occurred between your last invoice date and today.



How do I know when my online payment has been processed?
After you submit your online payment, you will see a confirmation message.  If you do not see the payment confirmation message, your payment was not processed.  A confirmation email will be sent to you at the billing email address in the account profile stating that your payment has been processed.



What is the Variable Energy Surcharge?
Rising energy prices have significantly increased our operating costs. To continue providing you with high quality products and excellent service, an energy surcharge will be applied to future invoices. The surcharge is based on the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price as published by the  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration  on its website. The surcharge will appear as a separate line item on each invoice, starting with your next statement. We reserve the right to apply the surcharge in our sole discretion. Please note that we do not establish the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price. To learn more about recent energy price developments, please contact the Department of Energy at (202) 586-6966 or go to the "http://www.doe.gov/engine/content.do" target="_blank"> U.S. Department of Energy website. We will monitor the need to continue the surcharge and we will adjust accordingly.



Why do I have multiple addresses?
We show both your billing address and delivery address. In addition, if you have recently moved, you may continue to see your previous address until your new address has been updated in your account.



What is the difference between "delivery address" and "billing address"?
The delivery address is the address where your products are delivered. The billing address is where your billing invoices/bills are mailed.



What is a Refundable Water Bottle Deposit?
A water bottle deposit is a fee charged for every 3 or 5-gallon bottle delivered to you. A bottle deposit is refundable and will be credited to your account once each empty bottle is returned. If you return more bottles than were delivered to you, then a bottle deposit credit is applied to your account. For example, if you received four full bottles and returned five empty bottles during your billing period, you will receive a bottle deposit credit for one bottle. A bottle deposit charge may appear on your invoice if more bottles were delivered to you than were returned to your delivery person. For example, if you received five full bottles and returned only four empty bottles during your billing period, you will receive a refundable bottle deposit charge. Remember, your invoice will only reflect the activity that occurred during the billing period.



Can I pay using another method than credit card?
Certainly, we also accept payments via debit cards (cards with the Visa or MasterCard logo), check payments by phone, and check payments by mail.



What if I move?
You can contact us prior to your move to ensure we offer service at your new address, you may do so by phone at 1-800-728-5508 or email using the "Contact Customer Service" form by clicking on the link at the bottom of your online account homepage.  Once it is confirmed that you are moving within a serviceable area, you may move the rental equipment along with your bottles to your new location.  If you are moving to a non-serviceable area, we will pick up the dispenser and/or bottles prior to the move.



What if your website says it is not available in my area?
We apologize for the inconvenience.  If you typed in your zip code and no services showed, delivery services are unavailable in your area at the present time.  We are expanding our delivery service, so please check back in the near future to see if services are available!



Can I change my plan as my needs change?
Call our Customer Service Department at 1-800-728-5508 to discuss alternative options that are available to you.



When is the billing cycle?
The billing cycle is every 28 days, beginning approximately 2 days after your first delivery.



Do you run a credit check?
A credit check is run if you choose to not set up your service using a credit or debit card.  Should you choose to set up your account using a credit or debit card, a credit check will not be conducted.



Why should I rent my water cooler?
By renting a cooler, you can be assured that you have the latest technology and receive the highest level of service from your delivery person.  If you ever have any issues with your water cooler, simply contact customer service or notify your delivery person and we will replace or repair the unit for you.


When will my products be delivered?
Your products will be delivered regularly, according to the printed schedule(s) your delivery person(s) provides. You can also  view and print your delivery schedule online. This schedule highlights delivery days so you always will know when you will receive your delivery.



How many water bottles will be delivered?
After your initial setup and delivery, your delivery person will replace your empty bottles with full ones. However, adjustments may be made based on your needs. If you would like a different quantity or additional products, please update your order online, leave a note for your delivery person, send an email to customerservice@dsservices.com, or call us at 1-800-728-5508.



Where will the water bottles be left?
You and your delivery person will decide on a convenient location to store empty bottles and where your full bottles will be left if you are not at home.


How do I communicate my product needs?
The best and most convenient way to keep in touch is by using the adhesive notes supplied by your delivery person with your delivery schedule. Just complete and leave a note for your delivery person on your scheduled delivery day. Adhesive notes are great for all sorts of communications, such as:

Asking service questions
Changing the amount of water delivered
Requesting information regarding additional products we offer
Notifying us of your vacation so we can anticipate your delivery needs



Can I change my delivery day or delivery time?
In order to provide the exceptional service you expect, our delivery system is set up to serve specific geographic areas on certain days.  Please discuss special delivery needs with your delivery person.


What if I forget to put out my empty water bottles?
Your delivery person will continue to deliver your water. Hold onto the empty bottles until your next regularly scheduled delivery. At that time, the empty bottles will be picked up by your delivery person. If your water consumption has changed, it is a good idea to leave a note on your empty bottles so your delivery person knows how many full bottles you would like delivered.


How do you ensure the quality of your bottled water?
In order to provide the exceptional service you expect, our delivery system is set up to serve specific geographic areas on certain days.  Please discuss special delivery needs with your delivery person.Our spring and artesian water sources originate well below the earth's surface and are inspected, tested and certified to bring you the best tasting, highest quality water.
 
Each of our spring water sources is certified by licensed geologists. Processes such as ultraviolet light disinfection and ozonation help us ensure that what you get in your bottle of spring water has the same natural mineral content found in the original spring source.
 
Learn more about our bottled water quality standards by viewing our water quality reports in English or Spanish on our quality standards page.  
 
Learn the facts about your drinking water from the Drinking Water Research Foundation (DWRF).


How can I show my support for bottled water?
Take a minute to sign a petition in support of bottled water. Your signature COUNTS! Available through the BottledWaterMatters.org website, the goal is 50,000 signatures. Please include your personal email address when submitting. Once completed, share the website with your family and friends, to ensure as many bottled water supporters as possible sign the petition.


What water container sizes are available?
Depending on your location, we deliver a wide variety of container sizes such as:

5      gallon returnable bottles
3      gallon returnable bottles
2.5   gallon bottles (3/case) in select markets
1      gallon bottles (6/case) in select markets
16.9 oz. (0.5 L) bottles (24/case)
24    oz. bottles (24/case)
8      oz. with added Fluoride bottles (24/case)

 


What are the cooler sizes available?
Dimensions vary but most of our water coolers are about one foot wide, one foot deep and approximately 3 to 4 feet tall.


What are the benefits of home delivery vs. store purchase?
Having our products delivered to your home or office is convenient and affordable.  It saves the time and effort of carrying your products in from the car and is always available when and where you need it.


Do you use glass bottles?
Most of our bottles are returnable plastic bottles; they weigh less and are safer to use.  In very limited markets, we offer our customers the option to select water in glass bottles.


What can you tell me about BPA?
Please refer to our question and answer page for more information about Bisphenol-A (BPA).


What is PET plastic?
PET stands for polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic resin and a form of polyester. It is the type of plastic labeled with the #1 recycling code on or near the bottom of bottles and containers and is commonly used to package soft drinks, water, juice, peanut butter and salad dressing.


Do you recycle your big water bottles?
Yes! We are dedicated to using the highest quality, most cost effective and most environmentally responsible  bottled water containers possible. Our 3 and 5 gallon bottles are cleaned, sanitized and refilled 40 to 50 times. Most of our big water bottles are recycled at the end of their life-cycle. The recycled plastic is used to make carpet, toys, tool handles, bird feeders and other items. For these reasons, you won't typically find large bottled water containers in landfills.


What are the recycling options for single-serve water bottles?
Our single-serve bottled water products are convenient, but we do urge you to recycle them if recycling programs are available. Recycling programs may not be available in your community.


How long is the shelf-life of a bottle of water?
Our bottles indicate a "best by" date. While bottled water is not a perishable food product, we recommend rotating your emergency supply and storing it under optimum conditions. Bottled water should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and high temperatures. Bottled water should be stored away from paints, solvents, garden chemicals, cleaning compounds and petroleum products, such as gasoline.


What type of bottled water containers should I store for emergency preparedness?
We recommend our 8-ounce, 16-ounce and 24-ounce single-serve bottles and 1- and 2.5-gallon containers. These smaller containers are typically easier to handle and store.


How often should I rotate the bottles of water that I have stored for emergencies?
We recommend rotating and replacing your supply every six months.


How can I be sure I have water for emergencies?
One way is to start home bottled water delivery service. The Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness recommends at least three gallons of bottled water per person in your emergency supply.
 Learn more about how to prepare for emergencies.


I want to speak to someone about advertising or event opportunities, who should I contact?
Thank you for your interest. Please use our Contact Customer Service form.


Why isn't water coming out of my dispenser?
The thermostat may be set too low and the water is frozen. To fix the situation follow these steps:

Unplug your dispenser.
Turn the dispenser around and locate the thermostat. In most models, the thermostat is about 2 feet above the bottom of the dispenser and is attached to the metal grate along the back of the dispenser.
Using a small standard screwdriver, turn the screw no more than a quarter of a turn to the left (counter clockwise) to raise the temperature.
Plug the dispenser back in, allow the water to readjust to the new setting.


If the problem persists, please notify Customer Service immediately by clicking on the "Contact Customer Service" link at the bottom of the homepage. We will reply to your request within two business days to schedule a time when your delivery person  can correct the problem.



What should I do if my dispenser should have cold and room temperature water, but both are cold?
The room temperature (cook) and cold dispenser has two distinct reservoirs that hold water at two different temperatures one at room temperature for cooking purposes, and the other chilled to about 45-50 degrees. Leading to each reservoir are two lines that hold about 12 ounces of water. In some cases, the cold line may accidentally chill the room temperature line, resulting in cold water coming from both spigots. Once the 12 ounces of water from both lines are released, room temperature water will dispense directly from the reservoir.


Why is water boiling inside the bottle on my dispenser?
While this happens infrequently and is not dangerous, it can be surprising to see. When an air pocket forms in the reservoir of a hot and cold dispenser, the heating element is exposed and creates enough heat to boil the water in the bottle above. If this happens, simply unplug the dispenser and dispense water from the spigots. This will release the air pocket. After the dispenser has been plugged in again, the water will be heated in the reservoir at the appropriate temperature.


How hot will the hot water from the dispenser be?
In a hot and cold dispenser, the temperature of the hot water is between 170 and 190 degrees. IT SHOULD BE DISPENSED WITH CAUTION AND KEPT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. If you are interested in receiving safety spigots, please speak with your delivery person, email Customer Service or contact Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508. We will respond to you within two business days.


What should I do if my dispenser or water bottle are leaking?
Email Customer Service  immediately or call Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508. We will schedule a time to come out and evaluate your situation. 

Until we are able to determine the source of the leak, there are a few steps you can take to prevent more water from leaking:

Remove the water bottle and drain the remaining water out of the bottle on the dispenser by releasing it through the spigots.
Once you remove the bottle from the dispenser, look inside the reservoir. If there is a full reservoir of water, and the   dispenser is no longer leaking, the bottle was the source of the leak, not the dispenser.
Let your delivery person know that the bottle had a leak and we will replace the bottle of water at no charge to you.
If the dispenser continues to leak once the bottle has been removed, continue to drain the dispenser through the spigots, until all remaining water has been drained out of the dispenser.


How do I clean my dispenser?
Click on Water Cooler Equipment Information to learn more about your equipment and how to clean it.


What should I do if my dispenser is not dispensing hot water?
Follow these quick steps to correct the situation:

Check the dispenser to see if it is plugged in and whether the electrical outlet is operational.
Reset the dispenser by flipping the reset toggle switch on the back of your hot and cold dispenser. The reset toggle switch on a countertop hot and cold dispenser is located between the spigots.

If the problem persists, please notify Customer Service immediately or call Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508.  We will respond to your request within 24 hours to schedule a time when we can correct the problem.


Do you offer coffee products, tea and break room supplies?

It is our hope that energy prices will subside soon. However, we cannot predict what the following months will bring and we may need to adjust the amount of the surcharge. If energy prices fall, then we will adjust the surcharge accordingly. The surcharge is based on the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price as published by the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration on its website at "http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/wohdp/diesel.asp" target="_blank". Please note that we do not establish the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price. To learn more about recent energy price developments, please contact the Department of Energy at (202) 586-6966 or go to the U.S. Department of Energy website located at "http://www.doe.gov/engine/content.do" target="_blank". We will monitor the need to continue the surcharge and we will adjust accordingly.

Will my Energy Surcharge change?  When will it change?
The amount of the surcharge may change dependent upon energy prices. It is our hope that energy prices will subside soon.

How often should I clean my cooler/dispenser?
Your cooler/dispenser should be cleaned every 1 to 3 months using the simple process outlined below:

Electric Coolers


Unplug your cooler and allow the unit to warm to room temperature
Remove the empty water bottle and drain any remaining water from the cooler/dispenser
Hand clean any removable parts in reservoir
Using a clean cloth, completely wipe the inside of the reservoir
Dilute one (1) teaspoon of unscented household bleach in one (1) gallon of water
Add this mixture to the reservoir and let stand for a few minutes
Drain the water from the COLD WATER spigot only
Rinse the reservoir with at least one (1) gallon of clean water
Drain the water again from the COLD WATER spigot only
Place a new bottle of water on your cooler and plug it in
Your cooler is now clean!

Non-Electric Coolers

Remove the empty water bottle and drain any remaining water from the cooler/dispenser
Hand clean any removable parts in reservoir
Using a clean cloth, completely wipe the inside of the reservoir
Dilute one (1) teaspoon of unscented household bleach in one (1) gallon of water
Add this mixture to the reservoir and let stand for a few minutes
Drain the water from the reservoir
Place a new bottle of water on your cooler
Your cooler is now clean!

Other Helpful Tips

The drip tray on your electric cooler/dispenser should be emptied periodically because it is not a drain.  It is designed to only catch the occasional spill
When changing the water bottle do not forget to wipe the neck and shoulder of the new bottle with a damp clean cloth or paper towel
Ensure that the water bottle dust cover flap on top of spill-proof cap is removed before placing onto the cooler's spill-proof probe
Never place any paper, objects, or liquids (other than bottled water) into your empty water bottles or cooler/dispenser

If you have any questions on how to clean your cooler/dispenser, please click the Contact Customer Service link at the bottom of the page.

                    Water Quality
                
Our Commitment
Our team of 200 dedicated, highly trained professionals is committed to providing you with a reliable supply of high quality water and responsive service. We know the most important thing we do each and every day is to provide clean, safe drinking water so families can trust the water we provide will contribute to their good health.
Water Quality Information
Annual Water Quality Report includes the results of more than 170,000 samples, or about 400 tests per day, tested at state certified laboratories for more than 120 potential contaminants and water quality parameters. 
Lead Test Results
If you are a private well owner and not served by Connecticut Water, we have the found the website of the Eastern Highlands Health District to be a good source of information. The State of Connecticut Department of Public Health also has a web page for private well owners.
 
Lead in Drinking Water
The importance of what our water professionals do every day is more evident these days with the recent media coverage of the water quality crisis in Flint, Michigan. We know customers may have questions and we want to assure you that we take a number of steps in our water treatment and testing so you can have confidence in your water quality. Our Lead in Drinking Water Factsheet provides answers to commonly asked questions about Lead in Drinking Water
You should know lead is rarely found in surface water (lakes,streams) and groundwater (aquifers, wells). Connecticut Water conducts extensive water quality testing at our sources and within our distribution system and no lead has been detected. The primary way lead can enter drinking water is when it comes in contact with lead service lines or household plumbing(pipes, faucets) made from lead.
A critical step in reducing the risk of lead leaching from customers’ service line or internal plumbing is to adjust the pH in the water system. We have a comprehensive corrosion control program that provides treatment based on the source water quality. Further, we fully comply with the EPA requirements regarding sampling for lead in drinking water and have provided documentation to the Connecticut Department of Public Health to demonstrate our results.

                    Customer Rates and Payment Options
                

Rates for water service for Connecticut Water customers are approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). Current rates were authorized by Docket 09-12-11 effective July 14, 2010. On April 1, 2014, the WICA charge in effect at January 1, 2014 was rolled into base rates while a two-year rate reduction was implemented as a result of a federal income tax refund filed for by Connecticut Water. In addition, the Water Revenue Adjustment was implemented. All of these changes were approved by PURA through a Settlement Agreement between Connecticut Water, the Office Consumer Counsel and the Attorney General's Office. More information on how these changes affected customer bills was provided to customers through a special bill insert.
A reliable supply of high quality water is essential to our quality of life. It provides for public health, hygiene, proper sanitation, protection of lives and property through fire protection, and allows for economic development that leads to job creation and tax revenues. At a cost of less than a penny per gallon, Connecticut Water delivers all of the benefits of high quality water to its customers 24 hours per day. If one were to put a value of having clean, safe water – it would certainly be higher than a penny per gallon!
It costs a typical Connecticut Water customer about $1.67 per day for all their water needs based on current rates. This is based on an average customer usage of 15,000 gallons per quarter, which costs about $150. Your cost for water service will depend on how much water you actually use and which water system provides your water. As Connecticut water has acquired smaller water systems, each system had it own set of rates some higher and some lower than Connecticut Water. For a rate schedule that applies to your system please see our Rate Schedules or call a customer service representative at 1-800-286-5700.
Payment Options   
We strive to provide excellent service and cost-effective, consumer friendly options for our customers, and we now offer more convenient ways for customers to pay their water bill. Connecticut Water offers full featured E-Billing with options to view account history, schedule automatic payments of water bills and receive and e-mail when a water bill has been issued. Customers can pay their bill at many retail locations, including Stop & Shop, Price Chopper, Shop Rite, Big Y, Kmart, Walmart and Rite Aid - in addition to paying online, by mail and by phone.

                    Environmental Stewardship
                

Connecticut Water has long shown a commitment to the environment through polices of land ownership, forest management and source protection.  The Company owns approximately 6,500 acres of land, most of which is maintained in its natural state for watershed and aquifer protection.  We conduct an aggressive, multifaceted source water protection program in towns in which our supplies and associated source water protection areas are located.

Environmental staff oversee forest management activities on our lands.  The goals are to improve the overall health of the forest to enhance water quality while at the same time improving the value for the forest for wood products; promote wildlife diversity and maintain property boundaries.  In 2015 CWC partnered with the CT Agricultural Experiment Station to implement a “Stormwise” roadside management demonstration project in the Town of Prospect.  The project implemented forest management practices to reduce the potential of tree caused damage to power lines during severe storms while maintaining an aesthetic roadside forest landscape.
Environmental staff also evaluate land use proposals that may impact our sources of supply.  This includes review of development proposals and submittal of comments to local land use commissions.   This process is intended to avoid potential problems by providing constructive input during the various stages of a proposal. 
The Company also has an Emergency Spill Response Program to respond to chemical spills within our source water protection areas.  Emergency spill control equipment is located a key facilities and employees are trained in appropriate and safe response procedures.
Watershed clean-ups have become an annual tradition for our company, where employees, family members, and friends work together to pick up trash in our watersheds. Over the past three years, our clean-up crews have gathered an average of 1,800 lbs of trash per event.
The Company is also committed to protecting land as open space.  The Company has worked with local communities to permanently protect as open space more than 1,000 acres of land that is no longer needed for water supply purposes.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Single-serve or bulk water? Choosing the  best option.
Thanks to their efficiency and lightweight packaging, single-serve bottles have proven a convenient and popular refreshment option for hydration on the go. The trade-off? Less water stored compared to its larger cousins.
On the other hand, our 3- and 5-gallon bottles have a much greater storage capacity, thanks to their larger size. Made of a strong polycarbonate plastic, the bottles are cleaned, sanitized and reused up to fifty times.

Should I use a water dispenser?
How much you consume is key. If you drink a lot of water, it would probably make sense. Water dispensers are great for bulk water products like returnable bottles, and they’re also environmentally friendly! The type of water dispenser you choose depends on a few factors including available space and convenience. 
Convenience: If you rent your dispenser from us, we will handle any repairs and/or replacements at no additional cost to you. That’s something worth considering!

How do I contact my delivery person (RSR - Route Sales Representative) ? You can reach your delivery person by leaving a note on the day of your delivery.  Simply attach the note with your request or question on an empty bottle.  If your timing is more urgent, please send an email message to customerservice@dsservices.com, which will be forwarded to your delivery person within two business days or call customer service at 1-800-728-5508. 



What are the benefits of Auto Pay?Setting up your credit or debit card with our easy Auto Pay service means one less check to write and mail each month, and more convenience for you.  Your card will be automatically charged or debited each billing period for your service on the date your invoice is created so you never have to worry about missing a payment.  Less paper and print are also great for the environment!  It's easy. Simply login to your account, go to the "My Account" tab and click the "Manage Auto Pay" button.  Select a credit/debit card to sign up for Auto Pay or enter new credit/debit card information.



When is my payment due?Payment is due by the Payment Due Date listed on your invoice.  Late charges will apply as noted on the payment stub at the bottom right corner of the invoice and as set forth in your customer service agreement with us.



What does "current balance" mean?Your current balance is your total outstanding balance, except for credits or changes processed today.  Your current balance and invoice balance may be different if order or delivery activity has occurred between your last invoice date and today.



What does "invoice balance" mean?Your invoice balance includes charges and credits applied during the billing period covered by the invoice.  Your invoice balance and current balance may be different if order or delivery activity has occurred between your last invoice date and today.



How do I know when my online payment has been processed?
After you submit your online payment, you will see a confirmation message.  If you do not see the payment confirmation message, your payment was not processed.  A confirmation email will be sent to you at the billing email address in the account profile stating that your payment has been processed.



What is the Variable Energy Surcharge?
Rising energy prices have significantly increased our operating costs. To continue providing you with high quality products and excellent service, an energy surcharge will be applied to future invoices. The surcharge is based on the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price as published by the  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration  on its website. The surcharge will appear as a separate line item on each invoice, starting with your next statement. We reserve the right to apply the surcharge in our sole discretion. Please note that we do not establish the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price. To learn more about recent energy price developments, please contact the Department of Energy at (202) 586-6966 or go to the "http://www.doe.gov/engine/content.do" target="_blank"> U.S. Department of Energy website. We will monitor the need to continue the surcharge and we will adjust accordingly.



Why do I have multiple addresses?
We show both your billing address and delivery address. In addition, if you have recently moved, you may continue to see your previous address until your new address has been updated in your account.



What is the difference between "delivery address" and "billing address"?
The delivery address is the address where your products are delivered. The billing address is where your billing invoices/bills are mailed.



What is a Refundable Water Bottle Deposit?
A water bottle deposit is a fee charged for every 3 or 5-gallon bottle delivered to you. A bottle deposit is refundable and will be credited to your account once each empty bottle is returned. If you return more bottles than were delivered to you, then a bottle deposit credit is applied to your account. For example, if you received four full bottles and returned five empty bottles during your billing period, you will receive a bottle deposit credit for one bottle. A bottle deposit charge may appear on your invoice if more bottles were delivered to you than were returned to your delivery person. For example, if you received five full bottles and returned only four empty bottles during your billing period, you will receive a refundable bottle deposit charge. Remember, your invoice will only reflect the activity that occurred during the billing period.



Can I pay using another method than credit card?
Certainly, we also accept payments via debit cards (cards with the Visa or MasterCard logo), check payments by phone, and check payments by mail.



What if I move?
You can contact us prior to your move to ensure we offer service at your new address, you may do so by phone at 1-800-728-5508 or email using the "Contact Customer Service" form by clicking on the link at the bottom of your online account homepage.  Once it is confirmed that you are moving within a serviceable area, you may move the rental equipment along with your bottles to your new location.  If you are moving to a non-serviceable area, we will pick up the dispenser and/or bottles prior to the move.



What if your website says it is not available in my area?
We apologize for the inconvenience.  If you typed in your zip code and no services showed, delivery services are unavailable in your area at the present time.  We are expanding our delivery service, so please check back in the near future to see if services are available!



Can I change my plan as my needs change?
Call our Customer Service Department at 1-800-728-5508 to discuss alternative options that are available to you.



When is the billing cycle?
The billing cycle is every 28 days, beginning approximately 2 days after your first delivery.



Do you run a credit check?
A credit check is run if you choose to not set up your service using a credit or debit card.  Should you choose to set up your account using a credit or debit card, a credit check will not be conducted.



Why should I rent my water cooler?
By renting a cooler, you can be assured that you have the latest technology and receive the highest level of service from your delivery person.  If you ever have any issues with your water cooler, simply contact customer service or notify your delivery person and we will replace or repair the unit for you.


When will my products be delivered?
Your products will be delivered regularly, according to the printed schedule(s) your delivery person(s) provides. You can also  view and print your delivery schedule online. This schedule highlights delivery days so you always will know when you will receive your delivery.



How many water bottles will be delivered?
After your initial setup and delivery, your delivery person will replace your empty bottles with full ones. However, adjustments may be made based on your needs. If you would like a different quantity or additional products, please update your order online, leave a note for your delivery person, send an email to customerservice@dsservices.com, or call us at 1-800-728-5508.



Where will the water bottles be left?
You and your delivery person will decide on a convenient location to store empty bottles and where your full bottles will be left if you are not at home.


How do I communicate my product needs?
The best and most convenient way to keep in touch is by using the adhesive notes supplied by your delivery person with your delivery schedule. Just complete and leave a note for your delivery person on your scheduled delivery day. Adhesive notes are great for all sorts of communications, such as:

Asking service questions
Changing the amount of water delivered
Requesting information regarding additional products we offer
Notifying us of your vacation so we can anticipate your delivery needs



Can I change my delivery day or delivery time?
In order to provide the exceptional service you expect, our delivery system is set up to serve specific geographic areas on certain days.  Please discuss special delivery needs with your delivery person.


What if I forget to put out my empty water bottles?
Your delivery person will continue to deliver your water. Hold onto the empty bottles until your next regularly scheduled delivery. At that time, the empty bottles will be picked up by your delivery person. If your water consumption has changed, it is a good idea to leave a note on your empty bottles so your delivery person knows how many full bottles you would like delivered.


How do you ensure the quality of your bottled water?
In order to provide the exceptional service you expect, our delivery system is set up to serve specific geographic areas on certain days.  Please discuss special delivery needs with your delivery person.Our spring and artesian water sources originate well below the earth's surface and are inspected, tested and certified to bring you the best tasting, highest quality water.
 
Each of our spring water sources is certified by licensed geologists. Processes such as ultraviolet light disinfection and ozonation help us ensure that what you get in your bottle of spring water has the same natural mineral content found in the original spring source.
 
Learn more about our bottled water quality standards by viewing our water quality reports in English or Spanish on our quality standards page.  
 
Learn the facts about your drinking water from the Drinking Water Research Foundation (DWRF).


How can I show my support for bottled water?
Take a minute to sign a petition in support of bottled water. Your signature COUNTS! Available through the BottledWaterMatters.org website, the goal is 50,000 signatures. Please include your personal email address when submitting. Once completed, share the website with your family and friends, to ensure as many bottled water supporters as possible sign the petition.


What water container sizes are available?
Depending on your location, we deliver a wide variety of container sizes such as:

5      gallon returnable bottles
3      gallon returnable bottles
2.5   gallon bottles (3/case) in select markets
1      gallon bottles (6/case) in select markets
16.9 oz. (0.5 L) bottles (24/case)
24    oz. bottles (24/case)
8      oz. with added Fluoride bottles (24/case)

 


What are the cooler sizes available?
Dimensions vary but most of our water coolers are about one foot wide, one foot deep and approximately 3 to 4 feet tall.


What are the benefits of home delivery vs. store purchase?
Having our products delivered to your home or office is convenient and affordable.  It saves the time and effort of carrying your products in from the car and is always available when and where you need it.


Do you use glass bottles?
Most of our bottles are returnable plastic bottles; they weigh less and are safer to use.  In very limited markets, we offer our customers the option to select water in glass bottles.


What can you tell me about BPA?
Please refer to our question and answer page for more information about Bisphenol-A (BPA).


What is PET plastic?
PET stands for polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic resin and a form of polyester. It is the type of plastic labeled with the #1 recycling code on or near the bottom of bottles and containers and is commonly used to package soft drinks, water, juice, peanut butter and salad dressing.


Do you recycle your big water bottles?
Yes! We are dedicated to using the highest quality, most cost effective and most environmentally responsible  bottled water containers possible. Our 3 and 5 gallon bottles are cleaned, sanitized and refilled 40 to 50 times. Most of our big water bottles are recycled at the end of their life-cycle. The recycled plastic is used to make carpet, toys, tool handles, bird feeders and other items. For these reasons, you won't typically find large bottled water containers in landfills.


What are the recycling options for single-serve water bottles?
Our single-serve bottled water products are convenient, but we do urge you to recycle them if recycling programs are available. Recycling programs may not be available in your community.


How long is the shelf-life of a bottle of water?
Our bottles indicate a "best by" date. While bottled water is not a perishable food product, we recommend rotating your emergency supply and storing it under optimum conditions. Bottled water should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and high temperatures. Bottled water should be stored away from paints, solvents, garden chemicals, cleaning compounds and petroleum products, such as gasoline.


What type of bottled water containers should I store for emergency preparedness?
We recommend our 8-ounce, 16-ounce and 24-ounce single-serve bottles and 1- and 2.5-gallon containers. These smaller containers are typically easier to handle and store.


How often should I rotate the bottles of water that I have stored for emergencies?
We recommend rotating and replacing your supply every six months.


How can I be sure I have water for emergencies?
One way is to start home bottled water delivery service. The Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness recommends at least three gallons of bottled water per person in your emergency supply.
 Learn more about how to prepare for emergencies.


I want to speak to someone about advertising or event opportunities, who should I contact?
Thank you for your interest. Please use our Contact Customer Service form.


Why isn't water coming out of my dispenser?
The thermostat may be set too low and the water is frozen. To fix the situation follow these steps:

Unplug your dispenser.
Turn the dispenser around and locate the thermostat. In most models, the thermostat is about 2 feet above the bottom of the dispenser and is attached to the metal grate along the back of the dispenser.
Using a small standard screwdriver, turn the screw no more than a quarter of a turn to the left (counter clockwise) to raise the temperature.
Plug the dispenser back in, allow the water to readjust to the new setting.


If the problem persists, please notify Customer Service immediately by clicking on the "Contact Customer Service" link at the bottom of the homepage. We will reply to your request within two business days to schedule a time when your delivery person  can correct the problem.



What should I do if my dispenser should have cold and room temperature water, but both are cold?
The room temperature (cook) and cold dispenser has two distinct reservoirs that hold water at two different temperatures one at room temperature for cooking purposes, and the other chilled to about 45-50 degrees. Leading to each reservoir are two lines that hold about 12 ounces of water. In some cases, the cold line may accidentally chill the room temperature line, resulting in cold water coming from both spigots. Once the 12 ounces of water from both lines are released, room temperature water will dispense directly from the reservoir.


Why is water boiling inside the bottle on my dispenser?
While this happens infrequently and is not dangerous, it can be surprising to see. When an air pocket forms in the reservoir of a hot and cold dispenser, the heating element is exposed and creates enough heat to boil the water in the bottle above. If this happens, simply unplug the dispenser and dispense water from the spigots. This will release the air pocket. After the dispenser has been plugged in again, the water will be heated in the reservoir at the appropriate temperature.


How hot will the hot water from the dispenser be?
In a hot and cold dispenser, the temperature of the hot water is between 170 and 190 degrees. IT SHOULD BE DISPENSED WITH CAUTION AND KEPT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. If you are interested in receiving safety spigots, please speak with your delivery person, email Customer Service or contact Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508. We will respond to you within two business days.


What should I do if my dispenser or water bottle are leaking?
Email Customer Service  immediately or call Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508. We will schedule a time to come out and evaluate your situation. 

Until we are able to determine the source of the leak, there are a few steps you can take to prevent more water from leaking:

Remove the water bottle and drain the remaining water out of the bottle on the dispenser by releasing it through the spigots.
Once you remove the bottle from the dispenser, look inside the reservoir. If there is a full reservoir of water, and the   dispenser is no longer leaking, the bottle was the source of the leak, not the dispenser.
Let your delivery person know that the bottle had a leak and we will replace the bottle of water at no charge to you.
If the dispenser continues to leak once the bottle has been removed, continue to drain the dispenser through the spigots, until all remaining water has been drained out of the dispenser.


How do I clean my dispenser?
Click on Water Cooler Equipment Information to learn more about your equipment and how to clean it.


What should I do if my dispenser is not dispensing hot water?
Follow these quick steps to correct the situation:

Check the dispenser to see if it is plugged in and whether the electrical outlet is operational.
Reset the dispenser by flipping the reset toggle switch on the back of your hot and cold dispenser. The reset toggle switch on a countertop hot and cold dispenser is located between the spigots.

If the problem persists, please notify Customer Service immediately or call Customer Service at 1-800-728-5508.  We will respond to your request within 24 hours to schedule a time when we can correct the problem.


Do you offer coffee products, tea and break room supplies?

It is our hope that energy prices will subside soon. However, we cannot predict what the following months will bring and we may need to adjust the amount of the surcharge. If energy prices fall, then we will adjust the surcharge accordingly. The surcharge is based on the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price as published by the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration on its website at "http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/wohdp/diesel.asp" target="_blank". Please note that we do not establish the Monthly U.S. Average On-Road Diesel Price. To learn more about recent energy price developments, please contact the Department of Energy at (202) 586-6966 or go to the U.S. Department of Energy website located at "http://www.doe.gov/engine/content.do" target="_blank". We will monitor the need to continue the surcharge and we will adjust accordingly.

How often should I clean my cooler/dispenser?
Your cooler/dispenser should be cleaned every 1 to 3 months using the simple process outlined below:

Electric Coolers


Unplug your cooler and allow the unit to warm to room temperature
Remove the empty water bottle and drain any remaining water from the cooler/dispenser
Hand clean any removable parts in reservoir
Using a clean cloth, completely wipe the inside of the reservoir
Dilute one (1) teaspoon of unscented household bleach in one (1) gallon of water
Add this mixture to the reservoir and let stand for a few minutes
Drain the water from the COLD WATER spigot only
Rinse the reservoir with at least one (1) gallon of clean water
Drain the water again from the COLD WATER spigot only
Place a new bottle of water on your cooler and plug it in
Your cooler is now clean!

Non-Electric Coolers

Remove the empty water bottle and drain any remaining water from the cooler/dispenser
Hand clean any removable parts in reservoir
Using a clean cloth, completely wipe the inside of the reservoir
Dilute one (1) teaspoon of unscented household bleach in one (1) gallon of water
Add this mixture to the reservoir and let stand for a few minutes
Drain the water from the reservoir
Place a new bottle of water on your cooler
Your cooler is now clean!

Other Helpful Tips

The drip tray on your electric cooler/dispenser should be emptied periodically because it is not a drain.  It is designed to only catch the occasional spill
When changing the water bottle do not forget to wipe the neck and shoulder of the new bottle with a damp clean cloth or paper towel
Ensure that the water bottle dust cover flap on top of spill-proof cap is removed before placing onto the cooler's spill-proof probe
Never place any paper, objects, or liquids (other than bottled water) into your empty water bottles or cooler/dispenser

If you have any questions on how to clean your cooler/dispenser, please click the Contact Customer Service link at the bottom of the page.
