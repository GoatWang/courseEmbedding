These are perfectly straight!On other competitors, even on higher price products, the seams are not sown straight down the legs, but fold back and forth different directions, but are not straight.The next thing I noticed, and I sort of expected this, was the weight of the denim. On these it is at 15.25 oz an others are only as heavy as 12.5.These really fit me well, and feel nice in my hands.I didn't expect the quality these are for the price I paid.VSMost Liked Negative Review My favorite pair of JeansWrangler is no doubt the best Jeans company in the world.

However, it really bothers me that the vast majority of their Jeans now, aren't made in the USA. Another thing is that it's really hard to pick the correct size - some products will run big and some will run small, even though they're the same size!Reviewed by 66 customersSort byNewestOldestHighest ratingLowest ratingMost helpfulLeast helpfulClear all filtersDisplaying reviews 1-10Back to topPrevious | Next »7/15/2017 4.0Would buy again!

Is that the suggested fit? What fit would be a little looser in the thigh yet, look similar to the original cowboy cut bleach wash?Asked on 12/26/2016 by Ben from Birmingham, AlKnow the answer? Answer this question0 answersQ:  I am very long waisted but of average height. Would these jeans be too tight through the crotch?Asked on 10/3/2016 by Badgeman from GeorgiaKnow the answer? Answer this question1 answer CUSTOMER CARE A: We need additional information to assist with your question. Please contact our consumer relations team at 1-888-784-8571.Thanks!Answered on 10/5/2016 by AnonymousQ:  are these jeans prewashed and shrunk?Asked on 5/12/2016 by jfagundes72 from Ferris, Tx.Know the answer? Answer this question0 answersQ:  do you offer the 13mgsds in a 42X36 or anything else in a regular cowboy cut  in this size that is prewashed?Asked on 4/17/2016 by mike jorgensen from Corvallis, Montana 59828Know the answer? Answer this question1 answer CUSTOMER CARE A: We're sorry, unfortunately we do not offer size 42:36 in a prewashed Cowboy Cut style. Thank you for letting us know you would like to see the size offered.Answered on 4/19/2016 by AnonymousQ:  Why have you been out of stock on the 13MGSSW 34 x 34 jeans?: I have been trying to order since the first part of May. I check about once a week and you have never gotten this size jean in in this style for over 3 months now. I think that is ridiculous and that someone ought to take care of business. As you can tell from your reviews it is a very popular style, so when will you GET IT BACK IN STOCK???????Asked on 7/20/2014 by SB44 from Jackson MOKnow the answer? Answer this question2 answers A: I am sorry that this has happened. We are set to get these back in stock in Mid-August. We appreciate your patience and can reach out to you when they become available so that we can place an order for you. We will be in touch soon. Thanks again.Answered on 8/7/2014 by WranglerBrand from undisclosed A: I just purchased a pair in a different size and it appears that your size is in stock now for the 13MGSSW.Answered on 12/16/2014 by tas60201 from Chicago, ILQ:  Any difference between cut of 13MGS and 13MWZ?: I generally wear the 13MWZ, but am interested in the George Straits. They look similar - is there a difference in the cut? If so, can you describe? We don't seem to get either style out this way now, only the 47MWZ, which for me isn't the same league. Thank you.Asked on 7/16/2014 by Waverley from AustraliaKnow the answer? Answer this question2 answers A: The fit of both of these styles is the same. However, the 13MGS has a few additional details like different back pocket embroidery and a star logo on the front pocket. While some certainly prefer one style over the other, I will note that the 47MWZ is made from a ring spun denim which is a premium fabric that making the denim longer lasting because of the way the yarn is spun. If you have additional questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at 888-784-8571.Answered on 8/7/2014 by WranglerBrand from undisclosed A: I have both styles and they seem to be cut about the same. For some reason I need on size smaller in the waist in the 13MGS style in the 13MWZ the same size is just a little too tight. The only other notable difference is the George Strait logo on the front watch pocket and some slight stitching differences on the rear pockets.Answered on 12/9/2014 by tas60201 from Chicago, ILQ:  What is the difference between style number 47MWDS and the Geo Strait style number 13MGSHD?: Do they fit the same? They both have a reg fit, both have a mid rise and both fit over boots.Asked on 4/29/2014 by rider67 from alabamaKnow the answer? Answer this question1 answer A: The 47MWZ cut sits a little lower on the waist and has much deeper pockets than the 13MG or 12MWZ. The denim is a very sturdy denim. I prefer the 47MWZ and 36MWZ cuts over the 13MWZ and 936 cuts. The lower cut on the waist is much more comfortable. I still wear all but the premium performance are my new favorites.Answered on 4/30/2014 by tas60201 from Chicago, ILQ:  Two questions. Are any of your jeans made in the USA? And do you sell any with a shorter inseam than 30?Asked on 3/5/2014 by Mfrank from Raleigh, NCKnow the answer? Answer this question2 answers A: Our products are manufactured in locations around the world with trusted partners. We do offer several styles in inseams shorter than 30. You can find those styles by visiting the page below and checking the box next to the length you need.http://www.wrangler.com/store/WRG_STORE_US/en_US/category/men/jeans.htmlAnswered on 3/6/2014 by WranglerBrand from undisclosed A: The only model I have purchased that was made in america in the last 5 plus years are the recently added limited edition jeans. http://www.wrangler.com/store/WRG_STORE_US/en_US/style/mwusa.html#categoryId=17776Answered on 12/9/2014 by tas60201 from Chicago, ILQ:  hi: where do I get this belt and buckle ?? ))http://www.wrangler.com/store/WRG_STORE_US/en_US/style/13mwzt.html#categoryId=17672Asked on 2/10/2014 by BoxyKnow the answer?

Product Description▼▲
This Novel Unit Student Packet is designed to be used with the not-included My Side of the Mountain Novel Units Teacher's Guide; the book My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George must be obtained separately. A few pre-reading activities are included to gauge a student's familiarity with the context of the novel. Once the student has began reading the novel, vocabulary activities, graphic organizers, review and comprehension questions, quizzes, a final test, puzzles, project and essay ideas, and a line-listed answer key are included. Exercises help students focus on literary and character analysis, as well as critical thinking and comprehension skills. Student questions reference the edition quoted in the front cover. [Puffin Books softcover published by The Penguin Group, copyright 1959, 1988]. Pages are reproducible for classroom use; softcover. Answers included. Grades 7-8.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In 1959, Jean Craighead George published My Side of the Mountain. This coming-of-age story about a boy and his falcon went on to win a Newbery Honor, and for the past forty years has enthralled and entertained generations of would-be Sam Gribleys. The two books that followed--On the Far Side of the Mountain and Frightful's Mountain--were equally extraordinary. Now all three books are available in one deluxe yet affordable volume for veteran devotees and brand-new fans alike.


Author Bio▼▲
Jean Craighead George was the preeminent nature writer for children. She is the author of My Side of the Mountain and Julie of the Wolves, and her work spanned 50 years. She died in May 2012 at age 93.

				All King George III ever wanted was for everyone to be as conscientiously obedient in obeying the rules as he was! He did everything to be a good king: he married a princess, he had heirs, and he was a good and faithful steward to his country's money. So why then, did those rebellious American choose to cause so much trouble for him? From the King's royal viewpoint, they were no more than traitors and scoundrels, and a troublesome force to reckon with! This fabulously creative portrayal of Britain's King George III is certain to stimulate interest in and establish genuine understanding of this early period in the American Revolution. Fritz presents the biography of King George to readers humorously, and with historical acuity. Using fascinating trivia and other tidbits, Fritz enlivens history, and gives young readers insight into this famous King's personality. Tomie dePaola's well-loved illustrations compliment a text that has been literally showered with honors, including a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year award, and an IRA/CBC Children's Choice Book award. A jolly good read.
