Why ForSaleByOwner.com?


							Navigate your homeownership to a safe harbor by selling ‘by owner.’  
							Set the right price,  
							understand prevailing market trends through our blog,
							use our articles, special tools 
							and home finance information and calculators to chart your course.
							Make sure your buyer finds your house on line through our powerful listing services.
							It’s your ship. Be the captain!
						



Benefits of Buying & Selling By Owner






Buyers

							Homes for sale ‘by owner’ are often the best value in any neighborhood.  
							That is because owners have maximum negotiating flexibility, especially when they 
							don’t have a listing agent’s commission soaking up 3% or more of the sale 
							price. Of course, we encourage ‘by owner’ sellers to cover all or part 
							of the buyer’s agent commission, so there’s still no cost to you. And 
							check out our step-by-step guide to buying a house directly from the owner.

Sellers

							Sell your home ‘by owner’ and it will stand out in any neighborhood. 
							You will be in control of marketing, pricing, 
							and negotiating — critical tasks that can’t be trusted to an agent who doesn’t 
							have your best interests at heart.
						

							Your first step to ‘sold’ is to make the most of ForSaleByOwner.com’s powerful 
							listing tools that ensure that your house 
							will ‘get found’ by buyers searching online right now for their next home.

Foreclosures For Sale



						The more foreclosures in the neighborhood, the greater their impact on the market value of all 
						neighborhood homes. You can track foreclosure rates through local legal notices and property 
						tax records; doing so will help you detect trends that will affect the value of your home.
						You can also search foreclosure listings on ForSaleByOwner.com
