Topical compositions for inhibiting matrix metalloproteases and providing antioxidative activities



Patent number:  8435541
                                            

Abstract:  A topical composition according to the present invention for use in a skin care regimen that provides matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibiting activity, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP) inducing activity, and immediate and delayed antioxidative activity. Preferably, the topical composition comprises at least one MMP inhibitor, a TIMP inducing agent, Tremella fuciformis (snow fungus) extract, Camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract, and Eugenia caryophyllus (clove) extract.

Leadform for use with surface mounted components



Patent number:  4777564
                                            

Abstract:  An improved leadform for use with surface mount components is described. The improved leadform provides a connection to a printed circuit substrate which is highly resistant to stress related failures. The leadform is configured so that the connection utilizes a relatively greater area of the leadform for contact with a solder connection resulting in a more compliant connection. In addition, the present invention provides a preparation for the printed circuit media which allows the substrate media to absorb stresses which occur due to thermal cycling.
