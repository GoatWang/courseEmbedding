                        Environment Strategy
                    


We believe private sector capital will drive a wave of innovative solutions to environmental challenges in the years ahead.













 Investment Thesis 

Environmental issues capture an ever larger share of mind for citizens, policy makers and investors. Debates over renewable energy, ocean degradation, deforestation and related issues are intensifying as the world wrestles with a warming climate and the need to provide food security
and fresh water to a rising global population. Reflecting the growing visibility of environmental issues, nearly 200 countries committed to policies aimed at lowering the rise in world atmospheric temperatures at the 2015 Paris Conference on Climate Change.
                    

                        We believe private capital, more than foreign aid or government regulation, will drive a wave of innovative solutions to environmental challenges in the years ahead. Indeed, we believe companies that adopt sustainable policies will have competitive advantages that will translate into faster growth, higher profitability, better employee retention and wider economic moats. Accordingly, we are pleased to announce the Douglass Winthrop Environment Strategy for clients who seek exposure to companies we believe will prosper as the global economy confronts and adapts to a range of environmental concerns.
                        







 Investment Strategy 

Environment Strategy portfolios will invest in the common stocks of companies that (1) are adopting sustainable practices – e.g., reducing carbon consumption, enhancing water conservation, improving energy efficiency, using sustainable materials – in operations,  finance and marketing or (2) are providing products or services that directly address an environmental problem.
In addition to a rigorous environment screen, all potential investments will be screened for financial and competitive factors similar to those employed for core DWA portfolios. We will invest in wide moat, shareholder oriented companies with strong balance sheets, rising free cash flow yields and reinvestment opportunities.
                    

                        Our strategy is to  find profitable investments leveraged to environmental factors. We believe companies that are ahead of the curve on environmental issues, both in their internal practices and in the products and services they sell, will stay ahead of their competition, build a wider defensive moat around their businesses, attract the best young talent and will be better prepared for the future than average companies. Douglass Winthrop Environment Strategy, therefore should not be considered a typical socially responsible investment vehicle. Our goal is to select companies for investment that we believe are likely to outperform the market by enhancing our stringent investment criteria with an additional environmental screen.
                        





 Environmental Filters:


Engaged and Accountable Leadership
Transparent Assessment of Environmental Opportunities and Risks
Relevant Environmental Performance Indicators and Goals
Materiality of Environmental Strategy to Long-Term Value Creation
External Assurance of Consistency with Evolving Best Practices

Investment advisors to individuals, families, trusts and endowments.













 Firm 

Douglass Winthrop is a New York City based SEC registered investment advisor. 
                        The firm manages more than $1.8 billion for individuals, families, trusts, and endowments. Douglass Winthrop is owned by its principals and a small group of investors. 
                    

                        We manage long-only equity and balanced accounts that are customized 
                        to the individual needs, objectives and risk tolerance of each client. We offer wealth management advice to clients when relevant. Our fee structure 
                        is simple and fair, keeping our goals aligned with those of our clients at all times. Our primary objective is to grow and preserve our clients' capital.
                    





 Philosophy 

We believe long term ownership of high quality stocks and bonds is the best strategy for compounding and preserving wealth. Our portfolios typically have 25 to 30 stocks with an average holding period of three to five years. In balanced portfolios, we invest in high quality corporate, municipal and agency bonds.

                    

                        The principles of value investing underlie our approach to portfolio management. We own companies led by high integrity owner-managers, 
                        who run their firms for the benefit of shareholders. We select companies with near-permanent advantages arising from brand, industry leadership or economies of scale that increase the chances for success in times of stress. Strong balance sheets back all of our equity and corporate bond holdings.   We invest relatively more capital behind our highest conviction ideas. 
                        Our approach aims to minimize the risk of capital loss while achieving superior results.
                    









 History 

Douglass Winthrop Advisors, LLC was founded in 2000 by Robert Douglass and Jay Winthrop to manage assets for high-net-worth individuals, families, trusts and endowments. From a modest beginning with only a few clients the firm now manages over $1.8 billion.
                        Our professional staff includes Lea Paine Highet and Olivia Le Blan, two CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professionals, with considerable wealth management expertise, as well as investment committee members, Jay Winthrop, Robert Douglass, Charlie Howard, Bryce O’Brien, Josh Huffard, Bowdy Train, Oak Strawbridge, Grant Winthrop, and Phil Warner. Our professional team brings more than 200 years of collective investment experience to the daily rigors of overseeing our clients’ portfolios.
                    

                        Douglass Winthrop's success is due to its long-term record of growing and preserving clients' assets, its reputation for trust gained by always putting clients' interests first and its ability to attract talented partners. We believe this simple, elegant approach to business will continue to serve our clients and our firm well for many years to come. In April 2012, Douglass Winthrop moved into its current headquarters at 535 Fifth Avenue. We opened branch offices in Boston in late 2013 and in Washington, DC in early 2014.

We are committed to providing our clients with responsive service and proactive management of their financial affairs.















 Client is First 
Douglass Winthrop Advisors is proud of the strong value proposition its investment management services hold for 
                        clients which includes the following attributes.
                    


 Experienced Managers 
Our principals average over 20 years of professional 
                        experience in the investment management, wealth management and investment banking industries.
                    


 Tax Efficiency 
We understand the importance of enhancing wealth for taxable clients through tax-efficient investing. We work hard to keep 
                    our clients' tax bills low by practicing a "buy and hold" strategy. Turnover varies annually, but approximates 25% in any
                    given year.
                    


 Equity and Balanced Accounts 
We manage equity and balanced accounts for a diverse client base, and have extensive experience structuring accounts 
                        to meet a variety of objectives, from capital appreciation to income maximization.
                    








 Wealth Management 
Douglass Winthrop helps clients review, create and monitor comprehensive wealth management programs, including all aspects of trusts and estate planning. 
                        We refer clients to high quality service provider partners in the legal and accounting professions to execute plans, and coordinate with all advisors to ensure consistency.
                    


 Transparency and Access 
Ongoing consolidation in the investment management, brokerage and banking industries has left clients to struggle 
                    for attention from their account managers. We are committed to providing our clients with responsive service and proactive management of their financial affairs. Douglass Winthrop can 
                    be trusted to put its clients' interests first and to maintain their privacy at all times.
                    


 Simple, Fair Fees 
Our clients know what they own at all times through monthly and quarterly communication, as well as online access to account holdings. All clients are assigned to a partner of the firm for coverage and communication.
                    


 Clients are Clients of the Firm 
All Douglass Winthrop clients are clients of the firm, rather than a single partner.
