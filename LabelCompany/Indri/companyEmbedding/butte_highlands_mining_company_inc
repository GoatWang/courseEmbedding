         10-Q: BUTTE HIGHLANDS MINING COMPANY, INC.

Share


















































 



 















(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Cautionary Statement  Some sections of this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations may contain forward-looking statements.  Business of Butte Highlands Mining Company  Butte Highlands Mining Company (hereinafter "Butte," "We" or "the Company") was incorporated in May 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of exploring and mining the Butte Highland's (Only Chance) Mine, south of Butte, Montana. The Company is inactive, having sold the last of its mining claims in 2007.  We intend to acquire an interest in a business seeking the perceived advantages of a publicly registered corporation. We will not restrict our search to any specific business or industry. We may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. The Company may seek a business opportunity with an entity which has recently commenced operations, wishes to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital to expand into new products or markets, develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. The Company may acquire assets and/or establish subsidiaries in various businesses, or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  Management of the Company, while not experienced in matters relating to the new direction of the Company, will rely primarily upon their own efforts to accomplish the business purposes. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in the number of employees during the next 12 months. It is not anticipated that any outside consultants or advisors, other than the Company's legal counsel, will be utilized to effectuate its business purposes described herein. During the next twelve months, the Company expects to be able to satisfy its cash requirements, and does not foresee the need to raise additional capital during this period.  Effective July 6, 2009 the Company's Class A Common Stock was registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Effective April 29, 2010, our Class A Common Stock was listed for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Our trading symbol is "BTHI"  Result of Operations for period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the period ended June 30, 2015  During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $8,395 and $29,809 respectively compared to a net loss of $16,927 and $18,082 during the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2015.  Total operating expenses decreased to $8,395 during the three month period ended June 30, 2016 from $16,927, for the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in loss is due primarily a decrease in the amount of professional fees for services during the three month period ending June 30, 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's working capital at June 30, 2016 was $68,793 compared to working capital of $98,603 at December 31, 2015. Working capital decreased primarily due to continuing operating expenses with no income and additional professional fees incurred in connection with the Share Exchange Agreement with Interlok Key Management Inc.  Net cash used in operating activities was $28,995 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared with $17,488 during the six month period ended June 30, 2015.  Cash flow from investing activities was $0 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $ $0 during the six month period ended June 30, 2015.  Cash flow from financing activities was $0 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared with $0 during the six month period ended June 30, 2015.  As a result, cash decreased by $28,995 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016. The Company had cash of $73,823 as of June 30, 2016. It will not be necessary for the Company to raise additional capital to continue its business activities in 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  There are no preliminary agreements or understandings between the Company and its officers and directors or affiliates or lending institutions with respect to any loan agreements.

ITEM 5.06  CHANGE IN SHELL COMPANY STATUS.



On or about January 6, 2017, as a result of completing our Share Exchange
Agreement and changing the focus of our business from mining to, encryption
hardware and software we were, as a matter of law, no longer a "shell company"
as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Rule 405 provides that:
Shell company. The term shell company means a registrant, other than an
asset-backed issuer as defined in Item 1101(b) of Regulation AB (§229.1101(b) of
this chapter), that has:
 (1)  No or nominal operations; and
 (2)  Either:

   (i)   No or nominal assets;

   (ii)  Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or

   (iii)  Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and
nominal other assets.



                                       7


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: For purposes of this definition, the determination of a registrant's
assets (including cash and cash equivalents) is based solely on the amount of
assets that would be reflected on the registrant's balance sheet prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on the date of that
determination.
We have determined that we were no longer a shell company at January 6, 2017
based upon the fact that we have more than nominal assets, other than cash and
more than nominal operations.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential
security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can
affect our company and to take advantage of the "safe harbor" protection for
forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf may make
forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders
about our company. All statements other than statements of historical facts
included in this report regarding our financial position, business strategy,
plans and objectives of management for future operations, industry conditions,
and indebtedness covenant compliance are forward-looking statements. When used
in this report, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or
phrases such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect,"
"anticipate," "target," "plan," "intend," "seek," "goal," "will," "should,"
"may" or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of
future events or outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about,
actual or potential future sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or
operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and
important factors (many of which are beyond our company's control) that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements, including the following: general economic or
industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which our company
conducts business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or
regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to
raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines,
financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, other economic,
competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our
company's operations, products, services and prices.
We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and
assumptions about future events. While our management considers these
expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to
significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks,
contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many
of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, results actually achieved may
differ materially from expected results in these statements. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they are made. You should consider
carefully the Risk Factors and other sections of this report, which describe
factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in
the forward-looking statements. We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim,
any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.
Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We assume no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any
event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report, other than
as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Readers are urged to
carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in our reports
filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may
affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those
expected or projected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GLOSSARY OF ENCRYPTION HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TERMS
STATIC ENCRYPTION - (current 128 bit encryption) is like putting all of your
data into one big "safe". Once the encryption sequence is "hacked", ALL data
that is protected by that sequence key is deciphered and stolen by the hacker.
 Added protection involves changing the key on static single key encryption,
however, this change causes a large amount of overhead and slows the
transmission time down significantly.
DYNAMIC ENCRYPTION - (InterLok's patented encryption) incorporates a unique
encryption sequence that changes continuously so there is never a correlation
between data sent and data received.  This creates minimal impact in time or
complexity to the encryption/decryption execution process, keeping things moving
at an efficient pace.
SESSION HIJACKING - An attack designed to gain unauthorized access to
information or services, typically by monitoring network traffic and capturing
the cookie used for remote authentication.
MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MITM) ATTACK - An attack in which an attacker is able to
read, insert and modify at will messages between two parties without either
party knowing that the link between them has been compromised.
PHARMING - An attempt to redirect a web site's traffic to a bogus web site,
either by changing the hosts file on the victim's computer or by exploiting
vulnerabilities in DNS server software. Victims can enter a legitimate URL and
be redirected to a fake site, then be subject to ID theft.
ARP SPOOFING - A technique used to send fake ARP messages to confuse network
switches as to the true identity of a computer or other network component. As a
result, messages intended for one machine can be mistakenly sent to another
machine allowing packets to be sniffed for passwords and other sensitive
information.
BRUTE FORCE (DICTIONARY) ATTACK - An attack that consists of systematically
enumerating all possible candidates for a solution to the secret attempting to
compromise restricted information. Brute-force attacks benefit from the increase
in processing power.  In a brute force attack, automated software is used to

   WELCOME TO AMERICA'S #1 ONLINE STOCKS &BOND RESEARCH SERVICE ON THE INTERNET!
Let my Stock Research Company research old Stocks & Bonds for you - whether new or old, company research is my specialty!     






















      

Hi, I'm Cheryl Anderson. Since 1981 my stock research business has investigated thousands of uncancelled old company stock certificates for cash values, helping people reclaim money from old bonds and stock certificates. My stock certificate research company is well established and has provided stock search services for banks, estates, stock brokers, attorneys, and the general public. I can even research a company history and old stock shares dating in the 1800's!
























COMPANY SEARCH - STOCK RESEARCH - COMPANY RESEARCH
Let me put my expertise to work for you!  Our articles on old bond and stock certificate values have appeared in many financial publications such as Financial Forecasts, Personal Finance, Bond and Banknote News, Illinois Banker, North America Gold Mining Industry News and many others.  We also wrote The Stocks and Bonds Bulletin - a monthly column carried in many collectible publications.  We are also the recognized experts on old stocks and bonds (scripophily) in the annual Schroeder's Antiques Price Guide.





















SIX REASONS TO LET US RESEARCHYOUR OLD STOCKS CERTIFICATES
LOW RESEARCH FEE - my research fee is just $35 to $45 per company when others are charging $55 to $100 per company.  I personally conduct the research on your certificates and have no staff, which keeps the research fees low. You could pay more for the same service, but why?  And here's a special offer - if you can find a research service that offers the same services for a lower price, you just tell me and I'll match it!95% SUCCESS RATE - that's a track record I'm proud of.  I get the results on company research 95% of the time.  Occasionally I come up with no information on the company after exhausting all avenues of research.  If that happens, my research service is FREE to you and you will receive a FULL REFUND despite my costs and research time.EXPERIENCE - with over 25 years in the business, I have the resources, references and research tools to get your results quickly and efficiently.  My report is mailed to you within two weeks (on average) and we can even email the results to you for faster service!  Why risk your research with someone who has little or no experience?NO HIDDEN FEES - if your old stock certificates or old bonds have a cash value, I don't charge you a "recovery fee" to help you claim your money.  Others may charge you a large commission to cash in your old certificates.  I simply provide you with the research results and if your old stock certificates have a cash value, I'll give you names and addresses of who to contact so you can cash them in or bring them up to date by exchanging them for new shares.  FREE APPRAISAL - my report will include a free appraisal on your stock certificates and bonds if the company no longer exists and the certificate has no cash value.  The certificates may have a "collector value" to someone who collects old stocks and bonds as a hobby.  Some old certificates can be worth anywhere from $10 to $200 or more!FREE SEARCH FOR UNCLAIMED FUNDS - unlike other services, I'll check for any lost or unclaimed funds in the name of the shareholder.  Sometimes I find other "hidden assets" in the shareholder's name that is not related to the certificate or company I am researching for you.  These hidden funds can include forgotten bank or savings accounts, safety deposit box contents, dividend checks, pension deposits, and many other kinds of funds.  This is always a nice surprise for my clients who sometimes discover there are other hidden assets waiting for them to collect!  Let me go the extra mile for you! With these six reasons, you can't ask for a better agreement between us, can you?
















Discover the Cash Value of Your Unclaimed Bonds & Stocks









You could have hundreds, if not thousands of dollars just waiting to be claimed. I thoroughly research your old stocks and bonds to determine their value and if they can be cashed in. 



Stock Research










Do I research stock certificates from outside the US? How long does the research take? Can a stock be cashed if it's for an unlisted company? Find the answer to these questions and more by visiting here.
