Titanium Coating
Intelligent Sonic Technology


The obvious first: All Braun shavers go in straight lines, not in circles as you might know it from rotary shavers. We consider this shaving movement more intuitive and efficient. Test by an independent institute prove e.g. that Series 9 captures more hair in one stroke than any other shaver*.
Furthermore, Braun‘s Series 9 and Series 7 are the world‘s only shavers with intelligent Sonic Technology that 160 times per minute read and automatically adapt to the densitity of your beard. The shaver provides extra power exactly where you need it for fewer strokes and a more personalized shave.

Closeness & skin comfort
Fewer strokes minimize the risk of skin irritation, it‘s that simple. That‘s why many men with sensitive skin chose the efficiency of a Braun electric shaver.
For ultimate skin protection, Braun puts an ultra-thin foil between your skin and the super-sharp blades. Each foil comes with a unique pattern of 1,064 ergonomically formed holes that captures each hair in the perfect angle. This way, you get the long-lasting closeness you want without your skin ever making direct contact with the blades.











Gentleness

Braun shavers (Series 3 and above) have pressure sensitive blades that perfectly adapt to your skin. The premium models (Series 5 and above) also come with a dynamic flexible head that keeps maximum contact along facial contours.

















Wet or dry shaving experience


Some men told us that they prefer using their electric shaver with water, foam or gel for better gliding and a refreshing skin experience. That‘s why most Braun shavers are „Wet&Dry“, easily recognizable by the icon on pack or the model name.
This gives you the ultimate choice to shave with any method you want. By the way: All Braun shavers are 100% waterproof up to 5 meters, so you can perfectly rinse and clean them under running water.
















Perfect ergonomics

Braun Series shaver were designed to fit your hand naturally and intuitively. The ergonomic, curved shape and the perfect positioning of the interface touch points allow best handling in every situation.











Easy maintenance

Whilst every Braun shaver is fully washable under running water, our proprietary Clean&Charge Station automatically maintains your shaver at its maximum performance. Using a Braun Clean&Charge Station is in fact 10 times more hygienic than simply under tap water, and your shaver feels and smells like new every day.

                            The Braun Series 9 can be submerged in up to 5 meter deep water. Which means it is fully washable and you can comfortably rinse it under running water for easy cleaning.
                        

























                    Use Wet&Dry or in the shower.

                            For Braun, good design is so much more than what meets the eye. Every detail matters and forms a perfect fusion of form and function to create the best shaving experience for many years in use:  ergonomics, materials, surfaces, interfaces. Like the textured MultiHeadLock switch that provides an ideal grip position for your thumb during shaving.

Discover Braun’s step by step guide and learn how to look after your shaver using Braun Clean and Renew. Find out how to professionally clean it yourself!












1. Professional cleaning
New shaver feeling at the touch of a button 
Some Braun Series shaver models come with a Clean&Charge cleaning device. So you just push a button, and it cleans, dries and recharges your shaver automatically. So easy and absolutely hygienic.

2. Manually cleaning
Rinsing under running hot water
Almost every Braun shaver can be rinsed quickly and easily under running hot water. The cleaning effect can be improved by using a bit of standard liquid soap. And another tip: to give your shaver optimal care, you should put a drop of oil on the cutter block once in a while.














Cleaning with the brush
After removing the cutter head, the cutter block is easy to clean with the brush. When you’re done, switch the shaver on fort wo or three seconds. Careful: Never, ever clean the cutter foil with the brush. 




Cleaning with the cleaning spray
The cleaning spray helps clean your shaver thoroughly, removing all traces of sebum. After spraying both cutter parts, the soaked residues are easy to remove.














3. Maintaining
For 100% performance, replace all cutter parts every 18 months
After 18 months, you have shaved as many hairs as there are blades of grass on a soccer field! So it`s definitely high time to replace the cutter parts for your shaver to deliver 100% performance again. Since the cutter foil and cutter operate like the two parts of a pair of scissors, they inevitably wear out after so much high performance.

Titanium Coating
Intelligent Sonic Technology


The obvious first: All Braun shavers go in straight lines, not in circles as you might know it from rotary shavers. We consider this shaving movement more intuitive and efficient. Test by an independent institute prove e.g. that Series 9 captures more hair in one stroke than any other shaver*.
Furthermore, Braun‘s Series 9 and Series 7 are the world‘s only shavers with intelligent Sonic Technology that 160 times per minute read and automatically adapt to the densitity of your beard. The shaver provides extra power exactly where you need it for fewer strokes and a more personalized shave.

Closeness & skin comfort
Fewer strokes minimize the risk of skin irritation, it‘s that simple. That‘s why many men with sensitive skin chose the efficiency of a Braun electric shaver.
For ultimate skin protection, Braun puts an ultra-thin foil between your skin and the super-sharp blades. Each foil comes with a unique pattern of 1,064 ergonomically formed holes that captures each hair in the perfect angle. This way, you get the long-lasting closeness you want without your skin ever making direct contact with the blades.











Gentleness

Braun shavers (Series 3 and above) have pressure sensitive blades that perfectly adapt to your skin. The premium models (Series 5 and above) also come with a dynamic flexible head that keeps maximum contact along facial contours.

















Wet or dry shaving experience


Some men told us that they prefer using their electric shaver with water, foam or gel for better gliding and a refreshing skin experience. That‘s why most Braun shavers are „Wet&Dry“, easily recognizable by the icon on pack or the model name.
This gives you the ultimate choice to shave with any method you want. By the way: All Braun shavers are 100% waterproof up to 5 meters, so you can perfectly rinse and clean them under running water.
















Perfect ergonomics

Braun Series shaver were designed to fit your hand naturally and intuitively. The ergonomic, curved shape and the perfect positioning of the interface touch points allow best handling in every situation.











Easy maintenance

Whilst every Braun shaver is fully washable under running water, our proprietary Clean&Charge Station automatically maintains your shaver at its maximum performance. Using a Braun Clean&Charge Station is in fact 10 times more hygienic than simply under tap water, and your shaver feels and smells like new every day.

Discover Braun’s step by step guide and learn how to look after your shaver using Braun Clean and Renew. Find out how to professionally clean it yourself!












1. Professional cleaning
New shaver feeling at the touch of a button 
Some Braun Series shaver models come with a Clean&Charge cleaning device. So you just push a button, and it cleans, dries and recharges your shaver automatically. So easy and absolutely hygienic.

2. Manually cleaning
Rinsing under running hot water
Almost every Braun shaver can be rinsed quickly and easily under running hot water. The cleaning effect can be improved by using a bit of standard liquid soap. And another tip: to give your shaver optimal care, you should put a drop of oil on the cutter block once in a while.














Cleaning with the brush
After removing the cutter head, the cutter block is easy to clean with the brush. When you’re done, switch the shaver on fort wo or three seconds. Careful: Never, ever clean the cutter foil with the brush. 




Cleaning with the cleaning spray
The cleaning spray helps clean your shaver thoroughly, removing all traces of sebum. After spraying both cutter parts, the soaked residues are easy to remove.














3. Maintaining
For 100% performance, replace all cutter parts every 18 months
After 18 months, you have shaved as many hairs as there are blades of grass on a soccer field! So it`s definitely high time to replace the cutter parts for your shaver to deliver 100% performance again. Since the cutter foil and cutter operate like the two parts of a pair of scissors, they inevitably wear out after so much high performance.

                            For Braun, good design is so much more than what meets the eye. Every detail matters and forms a perfect fusion of form and function to create the best shaving experience for many years in use:  ergonomics, materials, surfaces, interfaces. Like the textured MultiHeadLock switch that provides an ideal grip position for your thumb during shaving.
