Kibush Capital Corporation Signs LOI to Acquire Australia's InstaCash Pty Ltd.

Sep 04, 2013, 05:52 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Kibush Capital Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


MELBOURNE, Australia, Sept. 4, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Kibush Capital Corporation (OTC: DLCRD) today announced it has entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire 80% of the Australian company InstaCash Pty Ltd. The LOI allows for a due diligence period of 30 days concluding no later than Sept. 30, 2013.
InstaCash is categorized as a Micro Lender and is licensed to provide financial products pursuant to the Australian National Consumer Credit Protection Act.  Founded in 2010, InstaCash has been an active participant within the lending industry for the preparation of the newly enacted legislation that commenced this year. The company has invested heavily in training and compliance from the onset. With two current store front locations and a model that proves it can produce profit with manageable risk exposure, the company is ideally poised for growth.  Since the introduction of the new reforms many competitors have left or scaled back as they lack the expertise required to comply under the new reforms.
InstaCash's management team has accumulated many years of experience in the financial services sectors and collectively has more than 22 years of industry specific experience.  This combination of expertise provides the knowledge and foresight necessary to effectively manage in an increasingly complex regulatory environment while still driving the commercial strategy and generating value.  InstaCash has a refined business process that has the systematic stability of a large company combined with the agility and leanness of a small company and it has structured its IT systems with growth initiatives in mind.
Management is headed up by Charmaine Rose, Founder and Managing Director, who has more than 22 years of experience both domestically and internationally in a wide range of financial and non-financial institutions. She has expertise in compliance, strategic financial and business performance management, capital management, financial systems, and training and development.
The demand for services is rapidly increasing in an already underserved market.  InstaCash has strong controls in place, and a committed team with the agility to adapt to new opportunities and challenges.  This will allow InstaCash to aggressively pursue acquisition and de novo opportunities. InstaCash has plans to open four additional locations and an internet based store front over the next two years.  InstaCash also will seek out complimentary products/services to its core business. 
With the certainty of the regulators and a mass exit of providers, InstaCash has never been better positioned for growth.  DLCRD sees this opportunity to assist in the development and growth of a company that is able to scale up to meet market requirements. And with demand expected to increase and new competitors not easily able to enter the sector, the opportunities for growth are excellent. DLCRD will establish an advisory committee to compliment the board in overseeing InstaCash and any other future businesses acquired.
