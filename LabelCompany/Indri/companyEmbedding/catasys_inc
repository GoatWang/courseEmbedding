LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --

Increasing Utilization and Expansions From Health Plans to Increase Equivalent Lives Under Contract in 2017 to More Than 20 Million 
Such Adoption Portends to a Cash Receipts Run Rate of approximately $126 million 12 months from Launch









Dear Catasys Shareholder,
We are pleased to update you, our valued shareholder, on the exciting events occurring throughout our business and will be taking steps to provide additional visibility into our progress going forward. The rapid pace at which we are expanding our engagements with the major U.S. health plans has dramatically increased the total number of equivalent lives we are reporting at the end of 2016.  This growth is expected to have a significant impact on our financial performance for 2017. 
The healthcare industry, in particular, health insurance companies and plans, typically take many years to allow a new entrant such as us to gain significant traction. It has taken the Company several years to prove out our business model, as it is currently accepted by many national health plan providers. During this time, we have found it virtually impossible to have enough visibility in our business to publicly provide accurate financial guidance and direction. Through this letter, we hope that you will sense something must be changing given our newly communicative posture. 
Further, we will briefly discuss our vision; the healthcare industry issues that we are addressing; the proprietary nature of our products; the scalable nature of our business, and our near term expectations.
Company Vision and Solution
The Company's vision is to improve the behavioral health industry by providing an innovative proactive treatment solution with cost saving opportunities for health plan customers, and ultimately be able to scale its availability on a national and perhaps one day, international basis. 
Today, we are focused on substance use disorder (SUD), depression and anxiety which comprises approximately 75% of behavioral health disorders. The U.S. currently has a passive system whereby treatment avoidant patients (cost, denial, stigma, access) need to seek out treatment, gain access to treatment, afford said treatment, and then receive the appropriate care that addresses both the physiological and psych-social aspects ("integrative care") of these complex diseases.
Unfortunately, the more severe patients we serve have these diseases as co-morbid conditions of each other, and have other co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular, diabetes, renal, liver disease etc. The average amount of costs associated with these patients directly related to the behavioral diseases alone is $30,000. These costs are predominantly from emergency room visits and in-patient hospital stays. 
Catasys provides an integrated outpatient solution with proprietary analytics and predictive modeling, proprietary enrollment, engagement and modification of behavior techniques. Our solution effectively turns the passive system, treatment avoidant, minimal access to care, unidentified patient population to a proactive, replicable, scalable, national solution where we focus on the complete care of the patients. 
The results from our solution have shown that patients are getting better, and the health insurance companies are consistently saving 50% of the medical costs for each patient enrolled. Hence, there is a health plan incentive to pay for all the associated treatment costs. Through OnTrak, behavioral health patients now have full treatment program coverage, increased access to treatment and effective care.
First Quarter and Full Year 2017
Catasys has emerged as a leading healthcare analytics company providing proprietary value-added care for health plan members. We are like "Amazon and Uber" to the  standard facilities-based behavioral health industry model, as we are virtual and scalable throughout the country, utilizing provider networks of independent contracted medical doctors and psychologists, companioned with our own care coaches, in an outpatient setting. 
All of our existing health plan customers, including, Humana, Aetna, Centene, and HAMP, have expanded OnTrak to their other products and expanded geographically. We are now operating in 18 states, with more to come. This week we have seen for the first time that one of our customers expanded from our SUD OnTrak program to the OnTrak treatment of SUD, depression and anxiety. 
While we have been growing revenues significantly year-over-year and sequentially, the numbers are quite small relative to what we expect in the coming year and beyond. We have worked through much of the customer specific logistical issues in 2016 that limited our revenues, and it appears that the "perfect storm" is beginning to culminate in the first quarter of 2017. 
"Perfect Storm"
We anticipate shortly that all of our existing customers will be operating at or near full capacity for the lives under contract by the end of the first quarter of 2017, with additional opportunities to expand. We expect this growth to come throughout their eligible members, including Medicare, Medicaid, commercial, individual, and, hopefully, TRICARE (military and veterans), as well as, expansion throughout our depression and anxiety offerings.
It's important to note that when a health plan contracts OnTrak for depression, anxiety and SUD, it represents an approximately 4.4X increase of the eligible population from which we enroll. We began the year with at or under 20% enrollment rates of eligible lives. We are constantly trying to improve our techniques and we are beginning to see the results. While we are only one quarter in, we are currently seeing a 20-25% enrollment rate which exceeds our expectations. 
Another input to the "storm" is additional health insurance contracts. We expect to add more national and super-regional health plans. This will be a major impetus to revenue growth. Excitingly, we expect many of the new contracts to include the treatment of depression and anxiety. These will be the first instances of new customers contracting for all three disease states. We are hopeful that in 2017 we will have contracts in place with health plans that represent in excess of 75% of the commercially covered lives in the USA.  We are hopeful that we will have contracts with 7 of the 8 largest health plans in the country. Importantly, all of our existing and future customers will continue to benefit from the trend in place, and expected to accelerate with the next administration, of more of the Medicare and Medicaid populations moving to managed care. These populations have an approximately 2.5X the eligible patients from which we enroll than a commercial population. 
Unfortunately, another "tailwind" is the increasing rates of mental illness in the U.S. In a survey released this week, one out of six adults take psychiatric medications. Alarmingly, 85% of them are prescribed multiple refills. This is indicative of rising dependencies and associated medical costs. The government increasingly recognizes the U.S. mental health problem and has instituted the Mental Health Parity Act, and this week, the 21st Century Cures Act became law thereby improving U.S. mental health efforts. 
The Result: Large Projected Revenue Streams
We believe that in 2017 we will nearly triple our Equivalent Lives (ELs) under contract from the current 7.5 million we have in place. Each 10 million ELs is anticipated to equate to a cash receipts run rate 12 months from launch of $63 million.  Hence, 20 million ELs could translate to a cash receipts run rate of approximately $126 million 12 months from launch. Excitingly, this is only the beginning and would expect significant revenue and cash flow growth rates for years to come. 
We are extremely excited for Catasys' future growth.  I certainly hope that you can sense my excitement for the coming year(s). Perhaps now you can understand why I personally invested in excess of $22 million into Catasys, Inc. Thank you for remaining dedicated to our Company's vision which will hopefully transform the behavioral health industry. 
I wish you a happy and healthy Holiday season, and a tremendous New Year for all Catasys shareholders. 
Respectfully,
Terren PeizerChairman & CEOCatasys, Inc.

14 Reasons to Look at Catasys (CATS-OTC)


Over the past several decades, there has been a change in how the U.S. views mental health issues. Today, a conversation about a tragic shooting has transitioned from being an “NRA issue” to a “mental health issue,” with these topics being picked up by industry, media, and politicians alike. With near-daily news reports of teenage or young adult suicides, attacks on family, military, schools, movie theaters, and so on by undiagnosed and untreated individuals, and a rise in accidental drug overdoses from both illicit and prescription products, conversations have begun to focus on increasing fairness in health insurance for behavioral and mental health conditions while reducing the stigma, costs, and hopelessness of seeking treatment for those who are suffering from a mental or substance disorder.


Substance abuse costs the U.S. over $700 billion annually due to crime, lost work productivity, and healthcare. There is a need for more efficient methods of engaging and treating substance-dependent individuals, such as what Catasys is working toward, in order to rectify the treatment gap that currently exists as individuals seek treatment for a physical infirmity but not for an underlying behavioral health condition. As of 2013, approximately 22.7 million U.S. residents (or 8.6% of the population) needed treatment for a problem related to drugs or alcohol, though only 2.5 million people (0.9%) had received treatment at a specialty facility (Source: National Survey on Drug Use and Health).


Catasys offers a new method of integrated substance dependence therapy to health plans and employers for its members through the Company’s proprietary OnTrak™ program. Employing analytics and proprietary engagement techniques to enroll and engage participants in need of care and patient-centric treatment, the OnTrak™ program has been developed to improve treatment outcomes and lower the utilization of medical health plan services by high-use/high-risk enrollees. Its services integrate medical interventions, a proprietary web-based clinical information platform and database, manualized psychosocial programs, and Care Coaching services in a 52-week outpatient program.

In any given 30-day period, 10% of the U.S. population is on five or more prescription drugs, many common combinations of which are extremely habit-forming and have a high rate of abuse by patients (Source: CDC). As such, there is a need for substance abuse programs to include physicians trained to fully assess not only the substance dependence but also any other comorbid conditions and concerns that may inhibit better health. Catasys has found that many of the high-utilizer individuals identified by its program tend to have chronic and interrelated, comorbid conditions that also need to be managed.



Seeking to transform the entire health management services system, the OnTrak™ program has shown to improve member health while reducing inpatient stays, emergency room utilization, and insurers’ total healthcare costs for enrolled members by more than 50%. The Company’s system is set up with the intent of benefitting healthcare insurers/payers (through cost savings), patients (financially and medically, including encouraging better treatment outcomes as people do not have to avoid treatment or leave the program early due to cost since, for most members, it is 100% covered under their health plan), and Catasys.


Catasys reports that it holds contracts with a number of health insurance plans for the OnTrak™ program, including Aetna/Coventry, Humana, and Centene. OnTrak™ is presently available in Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. These contracts cover approximately 2.3 million commercially equivalent lives (CELs). Management has specified that it has a sales pipeline with insurers for an additional 10 million CELs, of which it is in advanced stages of discussion for about four million. Catasys’ pipeline reportedly includes existing customers that have acknowledged the value of OnTrak™ and are considering expanding it to additional geographies or lines of business.


Catasys’ proprietary data analytics enables it to identify high-cost, substance-dependent members within health insurance plans who have the potential to have reduced costs through effective treatment of their behavioral health conditions. The Company then reaches out to these specific members, and has historically been able to persuade an average of 20% of a plan’s eligible substance-dependent individuals to enroll in the OnTrak™ treatment program.


High-cost, substance-dependent members cost commercial health plans an estimated eight times more than other members, averaging $27,500 in annual claims versus $3,250 for a “normal” covered life. Catasys’ data indicates that patients enrolled in the OnTrak™ program exhibit a reduction in claims cost of over 50%. Since health insurers are under constant pressure to reduce costs, they have an incentive to pay Catasys to enroll members in the OnTrak™ program.

Catasys’ program is helping make substance dependency treatment the same as any medical, pharmacological, or pharmaceutical treatment, where Catasys IS the treatment. The Company has shown that if payers/insurers pay Catasys $8,500 per commercial life ($9,300 for a Medicare/Medicaid life)—which covers the patient’s treatment expenses in the 52-week OnTrak™ outpatient program—the insurer may see a potential savings in the first year of $5,250 (given that it costs a payer/insurer approximately $27,500 in claims costs for these substance-dependent patients, and Catasys has shown a 50% reduction in claims cost). The cost savings is expected to continue after the first year as well as be higher as there is no fee per patient in the second year.



To Catasys’ knowledge, OnTrak™ is the only program of its kind entirely devoted to substance dependence. Developed by specialists in addiction, OnTrak™ has facilitated the formation of key areas of expertise, differentiating Catasys from others through member engagement, working directly with the member treatment team, providing a consistent, evidence-based treatment across geographies, and a more fully integrated treatment offering.


Catasys can provide its insurance plan customers with outcomes reporting as it relates to clinical and financial metrics to demonstrate and confirm the value of its program—with data showing an average gross cost reduction of over 50% as measured from the prior 12 months of enrollment. Furthermore, roughly 80% of members who have remained eligible have stayed in the program to date.


The Company’s model has been validated in its quarter-over-quarter (and year-over-year) growth. For the second quarter 2015 (ended June 30, 2015), revenue was up 51% to $472,000 versus $312,000 reported for the second quarter 2014. Catasys also reported a 102% growth in enrollment in the second quarter 2015 versus the first quarter 2015, which was driven by the expansion of the Company’s OnTrak™ program. Catasys recently expanded its Wisconsin program with a national health plan to include its Medicare Advantage members, added a new behavioral health condition (anxiety) in Kansas, and entered into an agreement with a new customer in Illinois that commenced enrollment during the third quarter 2015. For the first six months of 2015, the Company reported revenue of $905,000 versus revenue of $511,000 in the first half of 2014.


There are an estimated 204 million lives covered under managed care in the U.S. For every 1 million members in a healthcare plan, approximately $160 million in claims are incurred by commercial plan members diagnosed with substance dependence (equating into what could be a $2 billion market opportunity according to Company calculations). Catasys further has the opportunity to expand into other high-cost, under-managed populations having behavioral health diagnoses, such as anxiety (as it has recently announced) and depressive disorders—which could more than quadruple its current market opportunity.


Catasys is run by senior management that collectively has over 50 years of substance dependence treatment experience and over 100 years of healthcare experience, having developed an expertise in engaging, treating, and empowering members with coexisting medical and behavioral conditions to modify their behavior.

Terren S. Peizer, director, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer (CEO), has personally invested approximately $16 million into Catasys—somewhat uncharacteristic for a microcap company.



Catasys holds certain technology, know-how, and related intangible assets with respect to its OnTrak™ treatment programs.


As of August 13, 2015, Catasys reported a balance of approximately $451,000 cash on hand. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $152,000 as of June 30, 2015, and subsequently closed on a bridge note financing in July 2015 for approximately $3.3 million in gross proceeds that was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and provide working capital.

Catasys, Inc.: Poor Financials, Excessive Compensation And Paid Promotions - Catasys Inc. (OTCMKTS:CATS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Catasys, Inc.: Poor Financials, Excessive Compensation And Paid PromotionsJul.31.15 | About: Catasys Inc. (CATS) Hunter Straus Long-term horizon, Growth, long/short equitySummaryCATS financials show that the company is in dire need of cash.The company has seen paid promotions from third parties.Insiders control over 87% of the company's common stock.Executives compensation vastly exceeds the company's means.I have attempted to contact management via the company's website about these issues.Background
Catasys, Inc. (OTCQB:CATS) is a Nevada-incorporated firm that is engaged in the business of healthcare management services. Recently, the company's stock has undergone a series of paid promotions from third party entities, and insiders control over 87% of the company's stock. The company's filings also show that the company's finances are in poor shape, but the top executives have consistently received very generous compensation packages.
Business and Corporate History
As mentioned before, Catasys, Inc. provides healthcare management services to health plans. From the company's latest 10-k, Catasys describes its business:
We provide specialized healthcare management services to health plans and other third party payers through our OnTrak program. Our OnTrak program is designed to improve member health and at the same time lower costs to the insurer for underserved populations where behavioral health conditions are exacerbating co-existing medical conditions. The program utilizes member engagement and patient centric treatment that integrates evidence based medical and psychosocial interventions along with care coaching in a 52-week outpatient program. Our initial focus has been members with substance use disorders, but we have plans to expand into other behavioral health conditions, including anxiety and depression. We currently operate our OnTrak for substance dependence program in Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
This description seems pretty straight forward, but there are some crucial details that the company doesn't mention in its 10-K. Prior to March 17, 2011, the company was known as Hythiam, Inc., which was also engaged in the specialized healthcare management services sector. However, the company's description is slightly different. The 10-K from March 31, 2011 reads:

We are a healthcare services company, providing specialized behavioral health services for substance abuse to health plans, employers and unions through a network of licensed healthcare providers and its employees. The Catasys substance dependence program (OnTrak) was designed to address substance dependence as a chronic disease. The program seeks to lower costs and improve member health through the delivery of integrated medical and psychosocial interventions combining elements of traditional disease management and ongoing "care coaching", including our proprietary PROMETA® Treatment Program for alcoholism and stimulant dependence. The PROMETA Treatment Program, which integrates behavioral, nutritional and medical components, is also available on a private-pay basis through licensed treatment providers and a company managed treatment center that offers the PROMETA Treatment Program, as well as other treatments for substance dependencies.
In this description, the company touts PROMETA as a flagship product. However, in subsequent filings, the mention of PROMETA seemingly disappears after the 10-K filed on April 1, 2013. There is no discussion in any of the later filings or on the company's website as to what happened to this product -- it seems to have simply been abandoned.
However, the April 1, 2013 10-k does mention this,
Our PROMETA Treatment Program is not subject to approval by the FDA, and while the drugs incorporated in the PROMETA Treatment Program have been approved for other indications, they are not FDA approved for the treatment of alcohol or substance dependency. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, FDA approval for the drugs as they are used in the PROMETA Treatment Program. It is possible that in the future the FDA could require us to seek FDA approval for the drugs as they are used in the PROMETA Treatment Program.
This may provide an explanation why the program has disappeared from subsequent SEC filings, but I would really like to see some clarification by management as to the status of the program.

Financials
The company's latest S-1 filed on May 29, 2015 (after the most recent 10-Q, which was filed on May 15, 2015) shows that the company currently has $84k in cash and cash equivalents and total current assets of $331k compared to current liabilities of $3.6 million, and a working capital deficit of $3.1 million. The cash flow statement shows that the company's operations used $811k in cash for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Additionally, the company has an accumulated deficit of $254 million.
In light of these figures, it comes as no surprise that the company's auditors have issued a "Going Concern" notice on page 37 of the S-1, which reads:
We have been unprofitable since our inception in 2003 and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses and negative cash flow from operations for at least the next twelve months. As of March, 2015, these conditions raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents was approximately $84,000 and accumulated deficit was approximately $254.8 million. During the periods ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities was $5.3 million and $811,000, respectively. Although we have recently taken actions to increase revenues and raised approximately $1.8 million of net proceeds in the Bridge Note financing, we anticipate requiring additional financing, including the financing contemplated by this prospectus. We may not be successful in raising necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all, and we may not be able to offset our operating losses by sufficient reductions in expenses and increases in revenue. If this occurs, we may be unable to meet our cash obligations as they become due and we may be required to further delay or reduce operating expenses and curtail our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on us.
Looks pretty bleak, and confirms the financial concerns I pointed out earlier. Because of the S-1 filing, we already know that the company plans to raise additional funding through the sale of common stock, which will further dilute current shareholders.

Promotional History
CATS common stock has seen a series of promotional campaigns via email newsletters from Otcbb journal, and Stocks Impossible. Both of these newsletters disclosed compensation of $60,000 from a third-party entity known as Edge Media, LLC. While there is no mention of Edge Media, LLC in Catasys' SEC filings, it is always a major concern when a third party promoter is willing to pay thousands of dollars to generate interest in a stock that has over 87% of the common shares held by insiders.
Insider Ownership and Management Compensation
According to the latest S-1 filed on May 29, 2015, two named shareholders hold beneficial ownership of 87.5% of CATS outstanding stock. Such massive insider ownership, especially in the period following a paid promotional campaign is a serious red flag and a great cause for concern among potential investors.
Beyond the massive insider ownership, it is important to note that page the company's top executives are very generously compensated. The table below, from Page 53 of the most recent S-1 shows salaries of $450,000, $374,250, and $164,538 in 2014 and $450,000, $370,287, and $150,000 in 2013 for the top three executives. In light of the balance sheet and cash flow figures, this compensation seems reckless and unsustainable.

It seems strange that the top executives received no option awards -- I would think that a company that is strapped for cash would want to provide a major incentive for management to improve the company's standing in the capital markets rather than squander the company's meager cash on direct compensation.
Given that the company currently has only $84,000 in cash and claims to have a workforce of 49 full-time employees (page 48 of the most recent S-1), it seems impossible that the company to be able to continue to pay its workforce without massive external funding. CATS current cash holdings are barely enough for a few months of rent, which the company claims to be $29,000 per month on page 7 of the most recent 10-K.

Conclusion
The company has undergone two name changes, a multitude of equity issuances, and all it has to show for it is an accumulated deficit of $243 million and no clear path towards a solid foundation. Insiders have beneficial ownership of over 87% of the company's stock, and top management still receives compensation that totals an order of magnitude greater than the company's current cash holdings. Beyond the woeful financial situation, the company has undergone paid third-party promotions. If you are considering a long position in CATS common stock, think again -- the company's SEC filings tell a lot that the promotional materials do not reveal.
