Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria.

Terrence W. Cavanaugh
Erie Indemnity Company announced that Terrence W. Cavanaugh, president and chief executive officer of Erie Insurance Group, will retire at the close of 2016. Cavanaugh shared the decision Thursday during a meeting of the Board of Directors, the announcement said.

“The generous timeframe around Terry’s decision allows the Board to provide a thoughtful and effective transition of leadership,” Board Chairman Thomas B. Hagen said in a statement. “Equally important, it allows us to maintain our dedicated focus on protecting and serving our customers, and supporting our agents and employees for the long-term.”
The process to appoint a new CEO launches immediately, and the Board aims to have Cavanaugh’s successor in place by the end of the 2016 first quarter, Erie Insurance spokesperson Leah Knapp said. To effect as smooth a transition as possible, the successor will report directly to Cavanaugh through the remainder of 2016, taking on the CEO role at the onset of 2017, she said.
Cavanaugh, 62, joined Erie Insurance in 2008 after a 33-year career with the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies. Under his leadership, Erie Insurance has grown property/casualty direct written premium by more than 45 percent and increased policyholder surplus by 60 percent, the company said.
Cavanaugh currently serves as the chair of the Board of Governors of Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI). He is also on the Pennsylvania Workforce Investment Board and boards of the American Institute for CPCU and Insurance Institute of America.
According to A.M. Best Company, Erie Insurance Group, based in Erie, Pennsylvania, is the 11th largest homeowners insurer and 12th largest auto insurer in the U.S. based on direct premiums written, and the 16th largest property/casualty insurer in the U.S. based on total lines net premium written. The Group has more than 5 million policies in force and operates in 12 states and the District of Columbia.
Erie Indemnity Company provides management services to the member companies of the Erie Insurance Group, which includes Erie Insurance Exchange, Flagship City Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Property and Casualty Company, Erie Insurance Company of New York and Erie Family Life Insurance Company.

Terry’s Bio


TERRENCE W. CAVANAUGH
Terry Cavanaugh founded Accretive Consulting in 2016 as he transition from a 40 year career in the insurance industry. He retired as CEO and President of Erie Insurance – a $7 billion revenue property, casualty, life and annuity provider in 2016.
A native of Chicago, Cavanaugh joined Erie Insurance in 2008 after a distinguished 33-year career with the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies.
He progressed through a variety of positions with increasing responsibility in Chubb’s property/casualty business. These included several branch manager positions followed by two Zone Officer positions. As a Zone Officer, he was responsible for underwriting, claims, loss control and marketing activities, including management of the agency distribution relationship in up to 17 states.
He was credited with growing revenues and expanding the agency distribution channel, and raising underwriting, service and marketing functions to new levels of effectiveness. These achievements led to his appointment as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) for Chubb in 1999. As CMO, he developed new product capabilities that led to a rise in new products and premiums. Cavanaugh was then asked to return to Chubb Surety to serve as its Chief Operating Officer, a position he held until joining The ERIE in July 2008.
Under Cavanaugh’s leadership, Erie Insurance grew revenue by more than 55 percent and boosted policyholder surplus by 67 percent. Erie is widely recognized as a service leader and he helped further strengthen their customer focus by modeling their copyrighted mantra “Being Above All In Service”. Under his leadership Erie received numerous awards and recoginition from J.D. Power, Forbes and Barron’s. It was a member of the Fortune 500 every year he was CEO.
Terry’s external roles have consisted of being a board member of Highmark Health, a 17 billion revenue integrated healthcare provider, former Chairman of the Property Casualty Association of America, and a trustee of Mercyhurst University. In 2015 he was appointed to the Pennsylvania Workforce Development Board by Governor Wolf.
He is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and attended the Harvard Business School PMD Program.
ERIE consistently ranks on the Fortune 500 during Terry’s tenure, and was among Ward’s 50 top performing insurance companies. ERIE under Terry’s leadership was frequently awarded accolades from J.D. Power and Associates recognizing their strong customer service and product performance.
Cavanaugh served as the chair of the Board of Governors of Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI). In addition to PCI, he was appointed to the Pennsylvania Workforce Investment Board and boards of the American Institute for CPCU and Insurance Institute of America.
In 2013, Cavanaugh was selected to receive the Griffith Foundation’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognizes industry leaders for their commitment to education as well as their support of the missions of both the Griffith Foundation and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI). Cavanaugh also serves on the Board of Directors of Highmark, a diversified health and wellness system based in Pittsburgh, Pa., and the third largest integrated health delivery and financing network in the nation.
Terry’s past leadership roles were is a board member with the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, Mercyhurst University, Saint Vincent Health System, and the United Way of Erie County.Terry is a lifelong learner and has also spent time in other pursuits outside of his professional focus – a certified Firefighter, scuba diver and emerging woodworker and global traveler.
