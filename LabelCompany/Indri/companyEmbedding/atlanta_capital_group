ATLANTA CAPITAL GROUP
RIA
Atlanta Capital Group is a private wealth advisory firm that proactively manages investments through a powerful combination of disciplined strategies and personalized services.
“We serve high net worth individuals, foundations, endowments and retirement plans through a high-touch boutique advisory experience,” said ACG Principal, Jeff Shaver. As part of that approach, ACG places an emphasis on the client experience and ways to add value to their client relationships. 
This commitment to providing a boutique experience extends to the technology that ACG uses. For the last several years, ACG has used Black Diamond for its portfolio accounting and performance reporting. “We’ve been extremely happy with Black Diamond from the get go,” said Frank Tamplin, Managing Partner.  “Black Diamond could do everything we wanted it to do, however, we still needed a way to pull all of our clients’ financial information, including their bank accounts and assets held away, and present it in a compelling way.”
This need for a client reporting solution led ACG to Wealth Access. “At the time, we didn’t really know we needed Wealth Access until we saw it and what it could do,” Tamplin noted. “Wealth Access is intuitive, our clients’ love it and it has been a successful value-added service we can provide.”

“When we initially sit down with our clients to get them up and running on Wealth Access, all of their liquid assets are already loaded into the system from our Black Diamond platform. This integration makes it very easy for us and the clients to be able to get started.”

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.

I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more
