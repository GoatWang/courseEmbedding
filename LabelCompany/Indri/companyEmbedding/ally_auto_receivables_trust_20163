                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

consideration of the Issuing Entity’s delivery of the Notes
and the Certificates to, or upon the order of, the Depositor, the
Depositor does hereby enter into this Agreement and the Second Step
Receivables Assignment in the form attached as Exhibit B to
this Agreement (the “ Second Step Receivables

obligations hereunder and thereunder and to sell, transfer, assign

Schedule of Receivables and all monies received thereon on and
after the Cutoff Date or, with respect to any Substitute

(ii) the interest of the Depositor
in the security interests in the Financed Vehicles granted by
Obligors pursuant to the Receivables and, to the extent permitted
by law, any accessions thereto;

(iii) the interest of the Depositor
in any proceeds from claims on any physical damage, credit life,
credit disability or other insurance policies covering the related
Financed Vehicles or Obligors;

(iv) the interest of the Depositor
in any proceeds from recourse against Dealers on the
Receivables;

(v) all right, title and interest of

Person in connection with the Receivables, any Dealer Agreements,
any insurance policies or any other agreement or instrument

Section 2.03 Representations
and Warranties as to the Receivables and Covenants with respect to
the Asset Representations Reviewer .

(a) Representations and
Warranties as to the Receivables . Pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(v) , the Depositor assigns to the
Issuing Entity all of its right, title and interest in, to and
under the Pooling Agreement. Such assigned right, title and
interest includes the benefit of the representations and warranties
of the Seller made to the Depositor pursuant to Section 3.01
or Section 3.02 of the Pooling Agreement. The Depositor hereby
represents and warrants to the Issuing Entity that the Depositor
has taken no action which would cause such representations and
warranties of the Seller to be false in any material respect as of
the Closing Date. The Depositor further acknowledges that the
Issuing Entity and its permitted assignees rely on the
representations and warranties of the Depositor under this
Agreement and of the Seller under the Pooling Agreement in
accepting the Receivables and executing and delivering the Notes
and the Certificates. The foregoing representation and warranty
speaks as of the Closing Date, but shall survive the sale, transfer
and assignment of the Receivables to the Issuing Entity and the
pledge thereof to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture.

(b) Covenant with respect to the
Asset Representations Reviewer . The Depositor shall promptly
deliver to the Seller any Asset Representations Review Notice. Each
of the Depositor and the Issuing Entity agrees to cooperate with
the Asset Representations Reviewer, the Servicer and the Seller
with respect to any Asset Representations Review commenced in
accordance with Section 5.17 of the Indenture. Upon receipt of
a final report from the Asset Representations Reviewer, the
Depositor shall review the findings of the Asset Representations
Reviewer and determine whether a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.01 of the Pooling Agreement
has occurred with respect to any Receivable tested by the Asset
Representations Reviewer and whether a repurchase or substitution
of such Receivable is required pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) .

Section 2.04 Repurchase or
Substitution of Receivables .

(a) Repurchase or Substitution of
Receivables Upon Breach of Warranty .

(i) Upon discovery by the Seller,
the Depositor, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, any Note Owner or any Noteholder of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 3.01 or
Section 3.02 of the Pooling Agreement or in
Section 2.03(a) or Section 3.01(b) of this
Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of
the Noteholders or the Certificateholders taken as a whole in any
Receivable, and which results in any of the Noteholders or the
Certificateholders not being made whole, the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice thereof (each, a “
Repurchase Request ”) to the others; provided
that in the case of a Repurchase Request from the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, any Note Owner or any Noteholder, such
Repurchase Request shall set forth (i) each Receivable that is
subject to a Repurchase Request, (ii) the specific
representation or warranty contained in Section 3.01 or
Section 3.02 of the Pooling Agreement it alleges was breached,
(iii) the loss that occurred as a result of such breach and
(iv) the material and adverse effect of such breach on the
interests of the Noteholders or the Certificateholders taken as a
whole; provided further that with respect to a
Repurchase Request from a Noteholder or a Note Owner, such
Repurchase Request shall initially be provided to the Indenture
Trustee.
 
3



(ii) As of the last day of the
second Monthly Period following its discovery or its receipt of
notice of such breach (or, at the Depositor’s election, the
last day of the first Monthly Period following such discovery or
receipt of notice), unless such breach shall have been cured in all
material respects, in the event of a breach of the representations
and warranties made by the Depositor in Section 2.03 or
Section 3.01 of this Agreement, the Depositor shall
(x) if the Seller would be required to substitute a Substitute
Receivable pursuant to Section 4.04(a) of the Pooling
Agreement, substitute a Substitute Receivable in exchange for the
