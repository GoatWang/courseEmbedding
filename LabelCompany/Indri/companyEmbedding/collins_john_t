Publisher's Description▼▲
Like any other relationship, our relationship with God must grow to survive -- yet many Christians just go through the motions spiritually. Passionate Spirituality is a call for lukewarm Christians to dive deeper in their relationship with God, incorporating biblical principles into our daily lives.John T. Collins explores five different facets of our Christian life that, when developed and strengthened, can have a lasting impact on our relationship with God. When we cultivate grace, growth, assembling in groups, giftedness, and good stewardship, the effects will not only be felt in our personal walk with God, but also in the world around us as we reach out into the church and the community.With discussion questions following each chapter, this book is ideal for both small group study and personal reflection for Christians who want to take hold of their identity as children of God.
