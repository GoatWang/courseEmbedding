Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

					Full Description



LeMaitre Vascular, Inc., incorporated on June 15, 1998, is a provider of medical devices for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. The Company develops, manufactures and markets medical devices and implants used primarily in the field of vascular surgery. It is engaged in the design, marketing, sales and technical support of medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease industry segment. The Company's product lines include valvulotomes, balloon catheters, carotid shunts, biologic vascular patches, radiopaque marking tape, anastomotic clips, remote endarterectomy devices, laparoscopic cholecystectomy devices, prosthetic vascular grafts, biologic vascular grafts and powered phlebectomy devices. Its portfolio of peripheral vascular devices consists of brand name products that are used in arteries and veins outside of the heart, including the Expandable LeMaitre Valvulotome, the Pruitt F3 Carotid Shunt, VascuTape Radiopaque Tape and the XenoSure biologic patch.The Company's LeMaitre line of embolectomy catheters are used to remove blood clots from arteries or veins. The Company manufactures single-lumen latex and latex-free embolectomy catheters, as well as dual-lumen latex embolectomy catheters. The dual-lumen embolectomy catheter allows clot removal and simultaneous irrigation or guide-wire trackability. Occlusion catheters temporarily occlude blood flow to allow the vascular surgeon time and space to complete a given procedure. Perfusion catheters temporarily perfuse blood and other fluids into the vasculature. Its Pruitt line of occlusion and perfusion catheters reduces vessel trauma by using internal balloon fixation rather than traditional external clamp fixation.The LeMaitre Disposable Angioscope is a fiberoptic catheter used for viewing the lumen of a blood vessel. It also provides direct visualization of valves during in-situ saphenous vein bypass procedures. The Company's Pruitt F3, Inahara-Pruitt, Flexcel and polyurethane Carotid Shunts are used to temporarily shunt blood to the brain, while the surgeon removes plaque from the carotid artery in a carotid endarterectomy surgery. Its Pruitt F3, Pruitt-Inahara and polyurethane carotid shunts feature internal balloon fixation that eliminates the need for clamps, thereby reducing vessel trauma. Its Flexcel shunt is a non-balloon shunt offered for surgeons preferring to secure their shunt using externally placed clamps. Its TRIVEX powered phlebectomy system consists of capital equipment and disposables that enable less invasive removal of varicose veins. The VascuTape Radiopaque Tape is a medical-grade tape with centimeter or millimeter markings printed with its radiopaque ink that is visible both to the eye and to an X-ray machine or fluoroscope. The VascuTape Radiopaque Tape is applied externally to the skin and provides interventionalists with a way to cross-reference between the inside and the outside of a patient's body, allowing them to locate tributaries or lesions beneath the skin.The Company's EndoRE line of remote endarterectomy devices are used to remove plaque from arteries in the leg in a minimally invasive procedure requiring a single incision in the groin. The EndoRE devices are used to separate the plaque from the vessel, cut the far end of the plaque to free it for removal, and then withdraw it from the vessel. Its 1.5 millimeter HYDRO LeMaitre Valvulotomes, Over-The-Wire LeMaitre Valvulotomes and LeMills Valvulotomes cut valves in the saphenous vein, a vein that runs from the foot to the groin, so the vein can function as an artery to carry blood past diseased arteries to the lower leg or the foot. The Company's AlboGraft woven and knitted vascular grafts are collagen-impregnated polyester grafts used to bypass or replace diseased arteries. Its LifeSpan ePTFE Vascular Graft is an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used to bypass or replace diseased arteries and to create dialysis access sites. Its Omniflow II Biosynthetic Vascular Graft is a composite of cross-linked ovine collagen with a polyester mesh endoskeleton used to bypass or replace diseased leg arteries, and to create dialysis access sites.The Company sells XenoSure Biologic Vascular Patch, a patch made from bovine pericardium. Its AlboSure Vascular Patch is a polyester patch. Vascular surgeons use patches in conjunction with carotid endarterectomy, remote endarterectomy and other vascular reconstructions. The Company's AnastoClip and AnastoClip GC Vessel Closure Systems allow surgeons to attach vessels to one another by deploying titanium clips in place of sutures. The Company's general surgery product is the Reddick Cholangiogram Catheter, which is used to inject dye into the cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this procedure, the gall bladder is dissected and removed through small punctures in the abdomen. It also offers a laparoscopic accessory used in laparoscopic gall bladder removal.The Company competes with Applied Medical Resources Corporation, Baxter International, Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., Medtronics, C.R. Bard, Inc., CryoLife, Inc., Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Getinge AB, LifeNet Health, Inc., Terumo Medical Corporation and W. L. Gore & Associates.

LeMaitre Launches 3 Products: 1.5mm Valvulotome, MultiTASC & AlboSure Patch



06/19/13


BURLINGTON, Mass., June 19, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. (Nasdaq:LMAT), a provider of peripheral vascular devices and implants, announced today its third product launch since March. These three new products strengthen LeMaitre Vascular's position as a one-stop-shop for peripheral vascular devices:

  MultiTASCTM Dissection/Transection Device (launched March 27, 2013)

  1.5mm Expandable LeMaitre® Valvulotome (launched April 29, 2013)

  AlboSureTM Vascular Patch (launched June 18, 2013)

 The MultiTASC device is a remote endarterectomy device which dissects and transects arterial plaque in a single pass, reducing procedure times and complications.

 The 1.5mm Expandable LeMaitre Valvulotome is the 7th generation of our flagship valvulotome for in situ bypass. The smaller size allows for more effective valve cutting in smaller vessels, while reducing potential damage to fragile vein walls.

 The AlboSure Patch is a polyester alternative to our XenoSure® Biologic Vascular Patch. Both patch platforms are used primarily during carotid endarterectomy surgery.

 "These three product launches underscore LeMaitre's commitment to R&D and our mission to be a one-stop-shop for peripheral vascular devices. Our growing sales force – now at 83 reps - is eager to bring these updated and expanded product offerings to our vascular surgeon customers," said George W. LeMaitre, Chairman and CEO.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
