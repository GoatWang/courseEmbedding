Crosslink Capital leads $10.1 mln round for Molekule
Crosslink Capital | July 21, 2017

Today Molekule, the company behind the only molecular air purifier proven to destroy indoor pollutants, announces $10.1 million in Series A funding. Led by Crosslink Capital with participation from SoftTech VC, Translink Capital, and Foxconn, the round will be used to scale production, expand its team, and build out the product pipeline. Molekule is also announcing the device’s availability to the general public.
Our air quality is rapidly declining due to increasing industrialization and other environmental factors. While unhealthy for everyone, for the one in four allergy and asthma sufferers in the U.S., poor air quality can be debilitating — particularly since climate change and rising levels of pollution are shown to worsen such symptoms.

Announcing our Investment in FairClaims
Crosslink Capital | July 19, 2017

Technology is transforming business-to-customer interactions almost everywhere you look. The process of submitting and managing dispute claims has been largely unchanged over the last half century. It’s painful, time consuming, and very manual for all parties involved. FairClaims aims to modernize how businesses manage and resolve customer disputes.
As TechCrunch covered earlier this week, we co-led the seed round in FairClaims with our friends at Fika Ventures. FairClaims provides simple, but effective dispute resolution to the ever increasing number of online transacting platforms, starting with marketplaces. Read the rest here.

AppDynamics and NodeSource Team Up For Enterprise Node.js Monitoring
Crosslink Capital | July 18, 2017

Node.js is a popular choice with application development teams due to its event-driven, non-blocking, flexible, lightweight and extensible framework which enables faster innovation and adoption of microservices. AppDynamics has supported monitoring of Node.js since 2014. It has been a cornerstone of our Unified Monitoring strategy providing visibility into end-to-end transactions, across disparate tiers and programming languages, to provide a full view of a user’s journey through an application.
That is why we are excited to announce our collaboration with NodeSource to provide the best monitoring support for the NodeSource N|Solid runtime. Read the rest here.

FairClaims raises $1.8 million to be a virtual “Judge Judy”
Crosslink Capital | July 12, 2017

Two years ago, Stephen Kane was looking for his next big idea. A lawyer who previously worked for the mega-firm O’Melveny & Myers and then spent time at Lex Machina, a software company that analyzed case law for lawyers, Kane was looking for the next new thing.
That was when he hit on his latest idea, FairCaims — an online service to resolve small claims cases. Kane calls it a virtual “Judge Judy” and he’s not wrong. Read the rest here.

Daddy’s home: Millennial fathers amp up parenting
Crosslink Capital | June 19, 2017

Tony Dokoupil takes a Father’s Day look at a new generation of devoted Dads:

Don’t let the sport coat fool you — Simon Isaacs is ready for the playground. He’s with his two-year-old daughter Kaia, selling imaginary tacos.
And while Simon’s afternoon with her may not look like much, certainly no more than what many moms do every day, the 36-year-old entrepreneur sees it as a small act of revolution. Read the rest here.

Casper, Mattress Maker, Raises $170 Million and Plans I.P.O.
Crosslink Capital | June 19, 2017

Several months ago, Casper, the most prominent of a new generation of mattress makers that rose to prominence through e-commerce, held talks to sell itself to Target.
Those talks fizzled as the two sides failed to agree on terms. Instead, Target is now leading a new investment in Casper — as the mattress maker aims for an initial public offering down the road.
Casper plans to announce as soon as Monday that it has raised $170 million. The investment is being led by Target, which on Sunday began selling Casper mattresses, pillows, sheets and more in its stores and on its website. Read the rest of the article here.

Here’s What Happens When Mary Meeker Puts You In Her Report
Crosslink Capital | June 16, 2017

Mary Meeker is known for making bold predictions that sometimes come true. That seems to be the case for Vungle, a 6-year-old private ad tech company that’s mulling over an IPO after being featured on Slide No. 27 of 355 in Mary Meeker’s 2017 Internet Trends report, according to insiders with direct knowledge of the matter.
If you’re wondering what Vungle does, but aren’t sure, that’s O.K. — the company says it prefers to keep a low profile. That is, until the report. Read the rest here.

Fatherly Installs Michael Wertheim as Company’s First COO
Crosslink Capital | June 2, 2017

We wrote in March about the arrival of Andrew Burmon as editor in chief of parenting website Fatherly. Since that time, the company has continued to grow, by leaps and toddler bounds. This week, Michael Wertheim (pictured) joined as Fatherly’s first-ever COO. Wertheim has enjoyed a solid media career, starting out with Time magazine, serving subsequently as general manager of ew.com and moving on eventually to high-profile consulting.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
