Overview
As a junior lawyer, Dave Hodgman knew he wanted his practice to involve complex issues of taxation. A trusts and estates practice offered this variety, but also required knowledge of many other legal areas including fiduciary law, real estate, corporate law and litigation.
When Dave started practice, most young lawyers had to try their hands at a wide range of   disciplines, and doing so gave him a broad background in these and related areas. Over the years he has concentrated in the areas of estate planning, probate, trust litigation, private companies and charitable foundations.
Clients often call upon Dave in potential conflict situations due to his non-confrontational manner and ability to find creative solutions. His 40 years of experience afford a broad perspective which helps him identify compromise solutions, and his collegial approach minimizes the risk of litigation.
Dave works with many corporate fiduciaries with regard to risk management and complex trust administration. He has represented numerous corporate and individual fiduciaries with respect tax and non-tax matters including fiduciary liability litigation.

Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
