			Securio Managed Security Platform		
 




Now for the first time ever - users can simply point their devices to a cloud service and have their Internet bound requests inspected and protected from sensitive data loss. The SaaS application that provides this service is Global Velocity's "Securio Cloud" managed service.







 







The Securio platform provides a powerful ICS solution to continuously monitor and manage sensitive information in the enterprise and the cloud.
It is the first and only Information-Centric Security solution available in the market. Securio is unique in its breadth, level of accuracy, feature set and ability to scale horizontally and vertically in the cloud.
It is designed to provide user access while protecting information in every format, wherever it is and wherever it is accessed -- in the enterprise network, the cloud and on mobile devices.




 




Securio Platform Scanning and Inspection Features







 

 
Patterns: Global Velocity has developed industry-leading pattern recognition technology that offers robust inspection of content at rest and in motion. Examples of patterns are credit card, social security and driver’s license numbers. Additional custom patterns can be created easily to search for patterns such as product numbers, patient numbers, customer account numbers, etc.

Dictionary Keywords: Users can also create and upload custom dictionary keywords and phrases that will be used by the policy engine to inspect for sensitive data at rest and in motion. These keywords can be assigned weighted values to compare against a pre-defined threshold. This feature can be used to detect document types, such as financial statements, healthcare records, source code, etc.



 

Virtual Vault: Using Global Velocity’s proprietary algorithms, users can also generate digital fingerprints of sensitive documents to be monitored and protected. The original document remains unaltered while the resulting digital fingerprints are used by the Securio to create a “virtual vault” that detects when the content, or portions of the content, have been moved or sent to unauthorized locations. Global Velocity is the only company offering this powerful functionality and protection in the cloud.



 

Policy Engine: A critical component of any security product is the policy engine. Based on extensive testing and refinement on large federal government projects, Global Velocity has enhanced its policy engine to be comprehensive, yet easy to use. Administrators of the system can create both straight-forward or sophisticated security policies based on items such as patterns, dictionary keywords, digital fingerprints, Internet traffic classification and protocols, email recipients and senders, file types and IP addresses. Incidents and notification lists can be configured to alert key personnel in real time when security events need attention. The system can be setup to block, notify, quarantine or log individual Incidents and Findings.




 
 




Global Velocity's Securio platform has the following components to help clients know exactly where their sensitive digital assets reside, how they’re being used, and if they’re being properly protected.




 





Discover: The Discover component is a comprehensive information-aware solution used to scan enterprise data storage areas for data at rest, inspecting it for fingerprint, pattern and keyword dictionary matches. Depending upon a customer’s workflow needs, flexible scheduling options are available to perform continuous, daily, weekly or monthly scans. The Discover functionality can be used to identify sensitive data that is located in unauthorized areas. This might indicate an ineffective company policy or that an unauthorized user has infiltrated a network and is staging sensitive data for exfiltration at a later time.

Protect: The Protect component is designed to defend against unauthorized data loss over the web and through email.  It is designed to monitor and/or block sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations. The Global Velocity Information-Centric Security platform can be used to inspect all outbound Internet traffic and scan content for fingerprint, pattern and keyword dictionary matches. User defined policies can be set up to block, quarantine or log this activity. All major Internet protocols are supported, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SMTP. 
Global Velocity also provides a unique Protect option called “Policy as a Service.” This option allows cloud application vendors to interactively query the policy engine with a single piece of content, such as a file or body of text. The policy engine will inspect the content request, comparing it against the customer’s defined policies, and return an appropriate status that the vendor can use to determine next steps to take within their application or process flow. This unique functionality offers great flexibility for SaaS vendors in particular, allowing them to integrate Information-Centric Security capabilities directly into their applications.
 




Manage: The Manage component is an intuitive and easy to use web-based interface for management and reporting of all Securio solutions. This interface is completely RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) driven and can be replaced by a customer’s proprietary dashboard if desired. This design allows cloud providers, SaaS installations and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to fully utilize Securio's functionality and optionally have results displayed cohesively within their product’s dashboard systems, whether customer proprietary or commercially available off-the-shelf.





Track: A unique and optional feature of Global Velocity’s Securio platform is the ability to track and record the genealogy and chain of custody of sensitive documents. This information is used by the Information-Centric Security platform for auditing purposes as well as to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior that could infer malicious intent.

Securio Cloud for MSPs, ISPs, and SaaS Vendors
In today’s business environment companies of all types are turning to the cloud as a viable alternative for data storage and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. As a result, more and more users are going directly to the Internet to do business, often operating unprotected, bypassing their established corporate security infrastructure. Governments, corporations, non-profits and more are now faced with the challenge of cost-effectively managing and securing massive amounts of valuable digital assets outside their corporate network, accessed by laptops, tablets and smartphone devices. They need your help.












 
As an MSP, ISP,  or SaaS vendor, you must offer affordable security solutions for your prospects, both to attract them to your service offerings and to keep them as clients. The cost of buying, deploying, and maintaining proxy type appliance security solutions in your infrastructure can quickly escalate out of control.
 
Securio Cloud solves this problem. It integrates information-centric security protection across web, email and mobile Internet traffic to secure sensitive data and IP outside a company’s firewall. This powerful architecture scans all outbound Internet traffic from any device or location and protects against data loss from mobile devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones - all with a single, consistent global security policy. 
 
You’re in Control. Unified Policies. Easy Administration.
 

Deploy Securio Cloud solution in minutes — not months.
Stop data loss across all users no matter what device they’re using or where they’re located — all with a single unified security policy.
Meet or exceed compliance and governance requirements for your customers with predefined security templates and extendable custom policies and reporting.

If your client adds an office - no problem. If your client starts to use smartphones and tablets to access the Internet - no problem. 
Lower TCO:  No hardware or software to purchase. Low setup fees. Low operating costs. The virtualized processes are started and stopped as requested, resulting in lower resource utilization. This yields better margins to service provides and SaaS vendors.
Pay-as-You-Go:  Fair monthly subscription pay-as-you-go pricing for you to simply pay for the protection your clients receive. Easy to budget. No hidden fees.












Summary
Cloud computing and mobile devices are here to stay. It’s time to move from perimeter-based security to an information-centric security approach. Mobile and remote user security starts in the cloud.
Imagine directing your Internet traffic through a simple and cost effective infrastructure that is globally available — an infrastructure that provides the same policy and protection whether users are in the office using their desktop, on the road at a hotel or airport using their smartphone or tablet, or at home using they’re laptop. 
Enhanced data security is now possible — only with Global Velocity’s Securio solution.

			Securio Managed Security Platform		
 




Now for the first time ever - users can simply point their devices to a cloud service and have their Internet bound requests inspected and protected from sensitive data loss. The SaaS application that provides this service is Global Velocity's "Securio Cloud" managed service.







 







The Securio platform provides a powerful ICS solution to continuously monitor and manage sensitive information in the enterprise and the cloud.
It is the first and only Information-Centric Security solution available in the market. Securio is unique in its breadth, level of accuracy, feature set and ability to scale horizontally and vertically in the cloud.
It is designed to provide user access while protecting information in every format, wherever it is and wherever it is accessed -- in the enterprise network, the cloud and on mobile devices.




 




Securio Platform Scanning and Inspection Features







 

 
Patterns: Global Velocity has developed industry-leading pattern recognition technology that offers robust inspection of content at rest and in motion. Examples of patterns are credit card, social security and driver’s license numbers. Additional custom patterns can be created easily to search for patterns such as product numbers, patient numbers, customer account numbers, etc.

Dictionary Keywords: Users can also create and upload custom dictionary keywords and phrases that will be used by the policy engine to inspect for sensitive data at rest and in motion. These keywords can be assigned weighted values to compare against a pre-defined threshold. This feature can be used to detect document types, such as financial statements, healthcare records, source code, etc.



 

Virtual Vault: Using Global Velocity’s proprietary algorithms, users can also generate digital fingerprints of sensitive documents to be monitored and protected. The original document remains unaltered while the resulting digital fingerprints are used by the Securio to create a “virtual vault” that detects when the content, or portions of the content, have been moved or sent to unauthorized locations. Global Velocity is the only company offering this powerful functionality and protection in the cloud.



 

Policy Engine: A critical component of any security product is the policy engine. Based on extensive testing and refinement on large federal government projects, Global Velocity has enhanced its policy engine to be comprehensive, yet easy to use. Administrators of the system can create both straight-forward or sophisticated security policies based on items such as patterns, dictionary keywords, digital fingerprints, Internet traffic classification and protocols, email recipients and senders, file types and IP addresses. Incidents and notification lists can be configured to alert key personnel in real time when security events need attention. The system can be setup to block, notify, quarantine or log individual Incidents and Findings.




 
 




Global Velocity's Securio platform has the following components to help clients know exactly where their sensitive digital assets reside, how they’re being used, and if they’re being properly protected.




 





Discover: The Discover component is a comprehensive information-aware solution used to scan enterprise data storage areas for data at rest, inspecting it for fingerprint, pattern and keyword dictionary matches. Depending upon a customer’s workflow needs, flexible scheduling options are available to perform continuous, daily, weekly or monthly scans. The Discover functionality can be used to identify sensitive data that is located in unauthorized areas. This might indicate an ineffective company policy or that an unauthorized user has infiltrated a network and is staging sensitive data for exfiltration at a later time.

Protect: The Protect component is designed to defend against unauthorized data loss over the web and through email.  It is designed to monitor and/or block sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations. The Global Velocity Information-Centric Security platform can be used to inspect all outbound Internet traffic and scan content for fingerprint, pattern and keyword dictionary matches. User defined policies can be set up to block, quarantine or log this activity. All major Internet protocols are supported, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SMTP. 
Global Velocity also provides a unique Protect option called “Policy as a Service.” This option allows cloud application vendors to interactively query the policy engine with a single piece of content, such as a file or body of text. The policy engine will inspect the content request, comparing it against the customer’s defined policies, and return an appropriate status that the vendor can use to determine next steps to take within their application or process flow. This unique functionality offers great flexibility for SaaS vendors in particular, allowing them to integrate Information-Centric Security capabilities directly into their applications.
 




Manage: The Manage component is an intuitive and easy to use web-based interface for management and reporting of all Securio solutions. This interface is completely RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) driven and can be replaced by a customer’s proprietary dashboard if desired. This design allows cloud providers, SaaS installations and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to fully utilize Securio's functionality and optionally have results displayed cohesively within their product’s dashboard systems, whether customer proprietary or commercially available off-the-shelf.





Track: A unique and optional feature of Global Velocity’s Securio platform is the ability to track and record the genealogy and chain of custody of sensitive documents. This information is used by the Information-Centric Security platform for auditing purposes as well as to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior that could infer malicious intent.

Global Velocity, Inc. Key Developments

Lenders Sue Global Velocity
Feb 15 17
Global Velocity has defaulted on its lease with its landlord and ceased operations. The suit - filed in St. Louis County Circuit Court by Ronald D. Jury, F. Holmes Lamoreau, GV Acquisitions LLC and the Missouri Technology Corp. - alleges that by ceasing operations, Global Velocity may have diminished the value of its patents, trademarks and other property subject to previous loan agreements as collateral. The lenders are requesting a receivership of collateral, including intellectual property. According to the suit, Global Velocity in January defaulted on $78,185 in rent at 540 Maryville Center in West County with landlord SVT 540 Maryville Centre L.P. The suit says Jury and Lamoreux each lent Global Velocity $375,000 in February 2013, later increasing each of their commitments to lend by an additional $125,000. GV Acquisitions lent Global Velocity $250,000 in July 2013, and the state's Missouri Technology Corp. lent it $250,000 in April 2014.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.
