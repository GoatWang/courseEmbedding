IRIS-EnLight (low light video enhancement)
IRIS-EnLight exploits sophisticated image and video processing technologies to enable high quality video under challenging lighting conditions in real-world applications like mobile phones, surveillance cameras and automotive. Images and videos captured in low-light conditions are facing two problems: Insufficient visual information and excessive noise. The IRIS-EnLight core simultaneously addresses these, in order to reach a clear and properly illuminant output.
IRIS-Enlight is not based in an HDR approach thus it does not suffer from the limitation of multi-frame HDR techniques (blurring, ghosting, etc). To this end, and due to the highly innovative techniques employed in this IP core, IRIS-EnLight is able to process video streams in real time and under any motion conditions, without limiting the freedom of the camera user. However, although it is not an HDR module, IRIS-EnLight has inherent HDR characteristics, being able to work evenly well in high dynamic range scenes.
Moreover, by using EnLight, integrators can significantly leverage the functionality and response of the device cameras, by allowing higher shutter speeds, which in other case would lead to darker results and inferior image quality.
IRIS-EnLight has been optimized for the challenging computational environment of mobile devices and can process video streams in real-time and with low-power. It incorporates a bundle of innovative color tone-mapping techniques as well as a proprietary video de-noising system providing high-quality results.
IRIS-ViSTA (video stabilization)
IRIS-VISTA is a unique video stabilization software module bringing advanced imaging capabilities to embedded systems. It is a flexible and scalable solution fully optimized to run in real-time using minimal processing workloads and very low memory bandwidth.
IRIS-VISTA has been optimized for the challenging computational environment of mobile devices and can process video in real-time. The combination of high-quality results and low computational requirements as well as low power consumption makes IRIS-VISTA an excellent solution for mobile appliances.
In addition to motion compensation, IRIS-VISTA allows for the correction of rolling shutter distortion which results in geometric image distortions and in the so called «jelly effect», often present in videos captured with CMOS camera sensors.
IRIS-VISTA – transforming your videos into memories you want to save and share.

Intelligent, scalable solutions for advanced wide area networksDesigning flexible communications for the smart, connected world










Overview
From smartphones to basestations, from M2M (machine-to-machine) comms to utility infrastructure – connected cities, workplaces, homes and vehicles demand intelligent, scalable solutions for wide area networks.
For the designer, this means building ever-more complex wireless SoCs that combine performance and flexibility with scalability and optimized efficiency. And that means getting the right balance between hardware and software.
This process can be greatly simplified by choosing from a wide variety of processor and hardware IP that is optimized for advanced wireless communications applications and that:

Supports different modes of operation and different communications standards
Integrates powerful vector capabilities alongside general computation engines
Combines the hardware platform with a wide range of readily available PHY and MAC software IP
Is backed by access to advanced support tools including reference platforms and software development kits






target markets



Wireless Terminals
Smartphones, tablets and data cards demand support for standards such as LTE and LTE-A, HSPA/+, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA and legacy GSM/GPRS/EDGE



IoT and Cellular M2M
IoT devices and M2M comms require multiple wireless communication standards including LTE Cat-M, NB-IoT and Wi-Fi 



Remote Radio Heads and Backhaul
Here the key is to select DSPs for effective front-end processing including digital pre-distortion, up/down conversion and DC offset correction



Wireless Basestation
Key design challenges include multi-standard operation and support for scalability from Pico and Metro cells to Cloud RAN, including Wi-Fi offload



Wireline Modems
G.Fast, DSL, VDSL-2, DOCSIS 3.1 are just some of the standards that IP must handle for wireline modems



Home Networking
Gateway devices demand single platforms for Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, 802.15.4 (including Zigbee and Thread), Bluetooth and LTE

 




CEVA's technology combined with its development tools and engineering support play a key role in LTE deployment.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CEVA, Inc. (NASDAQ:   CEVA), the leading licensor of signal processing IP for smarter, connected devices, today announced that Shanghai Frequen Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (Freqchip) has licensed and deployed CEVA's RivieraWaves Bluetooth low energy technology in its new FR801x family of wireless integrated circuits (ICs). Building on Freqchip's proven expertise in low power wireless IC design, the FR8010 is the first member of the FR801X family and is ideal for a wide variety of high-volume consumer products integrating Bluetooth connectivity, spanning personal health and fitness wearables to smart home appliances.








"Bluetooth continues to dominate as the connection of choice for very low power electronic devices," said Beck Li, CEO at Shanghai Frequen. "CEVA's RivieraWaves Bluetooth low energy IP has an impressive record of adoption and mass production in China and so was the perfect choice for us, providing advanced features in an ultra-low power architecture, all at low risk."
"We are pleased to announce Shanghai Frequen Microelectronics as a licensee for our RivieraWaves Bluetooth IP," said Aviv Malinovitch, vice president and general manager of the Connectivity Business Unit at CEVA. "The FR8010 is an impressive low power device that showcases the engineering pedigree of this company and offers a compelling solution for high volume Bluetooth-enabled consumer products."
CEVA's RivieraWaves Bluetooth IP platforms provide comprehensive solutions for both Bluetooth low energy and Bluetooth dual mode connectivity. Each platform consists of a hardware baseband controller, plus a feature-rich software protocol stack. A flexible radio interface allows the platforms to be deployed with either RivieraWaves RF or various partners' RF IP, enabling optimal selection of foundry and process node. All Bluetooth 5 features are supported, including LE 2Mbps data rate, Long Range and LE Advertising Extension. With more than 1 billion devices shipped to date and dozens of licensees, the RivieraWaves Bluetooth IP is widely deployed in consumer and IoT devices with many of the world's leading semiconductors companies and OEMs, including smartphones, tablets, wireless speakers, wireless headsets and earbuds, hearing aids and other wearables. For more information on RivieraWaves Bluetooth IP platforms, go to http://www.ceva-dsp.com/product/rivierawaves-bluetooth-platforms/.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CEVA, Inc. (NASDAQ:   CEVA), the leading licensor of signal processing IP for smarter, connected devices, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.











 







							 		CEVA, Inc. reported record Q1 2017 earnings with all-time high quarterly revenues of $21.3 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.28 and CEVA-powered shipments totaled a record 352 million units, driven by LTE and Bluetooth. For more information and highlights, view the infographic.
							  



 

 
 



Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $21.3 million, a 29% increase compared to $16.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2017 licensing and related revenue was a record $9.5 million, an increase of 10% when compared to $8.6 million reported for the same quarter a year ago. Royalty revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $11.8 million, an increase of 50% when compared to $7.9 million reported for the first quarter of 2016. 
Gideon Wertheizer, Chief Executive Officer of CEVA, stated: "Our strongest licensing quarter in the company's history helped to deliver a fifth record revenue quarter in succession. We also significantly strengthened our backlog, reinforcing our confidence in achieving our annual licensing target. We continue to experience strong demand for our unique portfolio of specialized platforms, including 5G, computer vision, deep neural networks and connectivity, all of which are set to generate new royalty streams in the years ahead."
GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 increased 128% to $4.1 million, compared to $1.8 million reported for the same period in 2016. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 increased 111% to $0.19 from $0.09 a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 were $6.3 million and $0.28, respectively, representing a 77% and 65% increase, respectively, over the $3.5 million and $0.17 reported for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 excluded: (a) equity-based compensation expense, net of taxes, of $1.8 million, and (b) the impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.3 million associated with the acquisition of RivieraWaves. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2016 excluded: (a) equity-based compensation expense of $1.4 million, net of taxes, and (b) the impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.3 million associated with the acquisition of RivieraWaves. 
During the quarter, CEVA completed eleven license agreements. Eight of the agreements were for CEVA DSP cores, platforms and software and three were for CEVA connectivity IPs. All the licensing agreements completed during the quarter were for non-handset baseband applications. Four were with first-time customers of CEVA. Target applications for customer deployment include: 5G base stations, automotive ADAS, smart surveillance cameras, smartphones, smart home appliances, and Bluetooth 4.2 and 5 connectivity for various IoT devices. Geographically, five of the deals signed were in China, one was in the U.S., one was in Europe and four were in the APAC region.
Yaniv Arieli, Chief Financial Officer of CEVA, stated: "In addition to an all-time high licensing quarter, our customers shipped a record 352 million CEVA-powered chips, resulting in 50% year-over-year royalty revenue growth. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter, with our cash balance, marketable securities and bank deposits totaling $164 million, with no debt."
