A Message From Louis C. Grassi

Thank you for your interest in Grassi & Co. I hope you find our website informative and valuable.  The site is not only a resource for clients, prospects and other business partners, but also a place to learn about the latest in tax issues, financial management and business and industry in general.
When I founded the firm in 1980, my goal was to build a firm that would add true value and provide clients with tools for success.  Those two ideas are intertwined because we believe that if we provide value to clients we will grow with them.  This belief has held true for 30 years.
As a firm, our success lies in our focus on entrepreneurialism, both in how we run the firm and how we approach clients’ challenges. With so many well-qualified CPA firms practicing in today’s marketplace, I feel strongly that Grassi & Co. offers certain attributes that allow us to stand out.
If you are a business owner, who is focused on growth and values a consultant who can advise you about financial issues, then you are a potential Grassi & Co. client.  If you’ve worked with a CPA firm that has been less than responsive to your needs, then we would like to show you our approach.  If you’re willing to pay a competitive and fair fee and you value proactive business advice, then we should sit down and talk.
We approach our business as more than simply providing accounting services. We consider ourselves “Success Consultants” as we offer advice and analysis to help you achieve your desired level of success – however you define it.  We call this approach “The Grassi Difference”.
If you think you may fit the client profiles described above, my partners and I welcome the opportunity to speak with you.  Thank you again for your time and interest in our firm.
Regards,
Louis Grassi, CPA, CFE
President & CEO
Grassi & Co.

Grassi & Co. Acquires Bernstein and Seidman | Business Wire
























































Grassi & Co. Acquires Bernstein and Seidman






January 13, 2017 10:34 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grassi & Co. is pleased to announce the acquisition 
      this week of Bernstein & Seidman.
    


      Over the past 30 years Bernstein & Seidman has accrued over 250 clients 
      in various industries including retail sales, import/export, food, 
      pharmaceuticals, real estate, and, most notably, the automotive industry.
    

      “As the automotive industry faces never-ending challenges on standards 
      of leasing and revenue recognition, we look forward to partnering with a 
      firm like Bernstein and Seidman whose commitment to those in the 
      automotive industry is unparalleled,” said Louis C. Grassi, CPA, CFE, 
      Grassi & Co. Managing Partner and CEO. “Merging Bernstein into our 
      company allows us to grow our accounting services practice and expand 
      our geographical footprint.”
    

      Grassi & Co. was founded in 1980 by CEO and Managing Partner, Louis C. 
      Grassi, whose goal was to build a firm that would add true value and 
      provide clients with tools for success. As a firm, Lou believes success 
      relies on a focus on entrepreneurialism, both in how the firm is run and 
      in how its professionals approach clients’ needs and challenges. That is 
      why Grassi & Co. professionals consider themselves “Success Consultants”.
    

      “We pride ourselves on our hands-on approach with clients and ensure 
      that when we are engaged on a transaction, our client’s business needs 
      are structured to take advantage of the various tax incentives 
      available,” said Robert Bernstein, a new Partner at Grassi & Co. 
      “Partnering with a firm like Grassi & Co. will aid us in being able to 
      offer our clients the products and services needed to help them grow 
      their business and compete in today’s changing landscape.”
    

      Bernstein and his staff currently have offices in Westchester County, NY 
      and are slated to move sometime in May to White Plains, NY.
    

      Grassi & Co., the 70th largest firm in the U.S., is a premier 
      professional service organization specializing in accounting, auditing, 
      tax, technology, and business consulting services. Grassi & Co. has 
      offices in Manhattan, Long Island and Park Ridge, NJ as well as 
      internationally through its association with Moore Stephens 
      International. Grassi & Co. specializes in professional services for the 
      Not-for-Profit, Construction, Architecture & Engineering, Financial 
      Services, Life Sciences, Manufacturing & Distribution, Retail, 
      Technology, Media & Telecommunication, Transportation, Energy & Natural 
      Resources, and Healthcare industries, among others.
