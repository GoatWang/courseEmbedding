About Us
Our Mission Statement
Cloud Peak Energy aims to be a leading energy producer operating in a safe, responsible and caring manner.

We will operate in accordance with our values.
We will not lose sight of our goal of maximizing the long-term financial return to our shareholders.
We believe that by ensuring the safety and long-term health of our employees are not compromised and that by being a good neighbor in the communities in which we live and work, value will be maximized.
We will run the business in a sustainable way to ensure we maintain our “license to operate” (i.e. support of employees, communities, regulators, elected officials, customers, suppliers).

Our current strategy is to build on our strong US domestic position to develop our export sales and explore international production opportunities.



Our Values
Cloud Peak Energy’s values are the underlying principles that guide the way we do business. We will hold each other accountable to not deviate from these values in all our business dealings.
Safety – The safety of everyone involved in our business will never be compromised.
Caring – We care about the impact of our actions on people and the environment both inside and outside the company.
Honesty – We are honest and transparent in all interactions with each other and those outside the company.
Courage – We will be courageous in all our dealings and will hold ourselves accountable for our actions and not avoid difficult issues.
Respect – We will show respect to all those involved in every interaction and work to engage all our employees in the business.

        Strong cost controls resulted in second quarter Adjusted EBITDA of 
        $45.2 million, up 21 percent from $37.3 million in the second quarter 
        of 2013, and first half 2014 Adjusted EBITDA of $84.6 million, in line 
        with the first half of 2013, despite continuing rail service issues 
        impacting 2014 shipments.
      

        Maintaining full year Adjusted EBITDA guidance, despite railroad 
        interruptions decreasing expected full year shipments. Reducing 
        capital expenditure guidance in the light of continued successes in 
        our asset management programs.
      

        Secured approval from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality 
        to release and self-bond $200 million of reclamation surety bonds. 
        This will help reduce on-going surety premiums and is a reflection on 
        the continued financial strength of Cloud Peak Energy.
      

        Maintained strong balance sheet with cash of $225 million and 
        available liquidity of $757 million.
      


      Colin Marshall, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We 
      were disappointed that rail service interruptions continued to impact 
      our shipments in the second quarter. However, we controlled costs and 
      capital expenditures, and we were pleased with the resulting financial 
      performance. We are continuing to work diligently with the railroad to 
      understand their plans for improvement. In the meantime, customer 
      stockpiles of PRB coal are at low levels and PRB coal remains a lower 
      cost fuel source compared to natural gas. We will continue to focus on 
      controlling costs as we await improved rail service to allow us to ship 
      our contracted tons through the rest of the year.”
    

Health and Safety Record


      We were saddened by the death of a haul truck operator at our Spring 
      Creek Mine in a single truck incident in June. Our thoughts and 
      condolences go to his family, friends, and colleagues. We are supporting 
      the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) during their 
      investigation and are awaiting their findings into the cause of this 
      incident.
    

      During the second quarter of 2014, of our approximately 1,400 full-time 
      mine site employees, two suffered reportable injuries resulting in a 
      year-to-date MSHA All Injury Frequency Rate (“AIFR”) of 0.77, an 
      increase from the full year 2013 rate of 0.59. During 32 MSHA inspector 
      days at our mine sites in the second quarter, we were issued just four 
      substantial and significant citations and total fines of $3,590 on two 
      of the citations. The fines for the other two citations have not been 
      assessed at the time of this release. During the second quarter, fines 
      of $5,931 were assessed on the eight citations we received in the first 
      quarter.
    

      In recognition of our commitment to safety, the Cordero Rojo Mine was 
      notified that it won the Governor’s Summit Safety Award in the large 
      mine category, and the Spring Creek Mine was awarded the 2014 Rocky 
      Mountain Coal Mining Institute Safety Award for large surface mines.

      While demand from our customers was very strong, second quarter 2014 
      tons sold from our Owned and Operated Mines segment were limited by rail 
      service interruptions which persisted throughout the quarter. We 
      understand the railways are taking measures to improve service but that 
      recent seasonal flooding and poor weather have delayed their efforts. We 
      will continue to work with the railways and our customers to maximize 
      shipments of contracted 2014 tons through the rest of the year.
    

      Revenue from our Owned and Operated Mines segment increased in the 
      second quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 due to a slightly higher average 
      realized price per ton sold and higher tons shipped. For the quarter, 
      the total cost of product sold decreased slightly which, combined with 
      slightly higher tons sold, led to the reduction in cost per ton. We 
      continued to achieve significant cost and capital savings from our 
      in-house condition monitoring and repair work. These savings were 
      partially offset by higher labor and fuel costs associated with the 
      additional workload and tons shipped. We continue to plan for higher 
      shipment rates for the rest of the year, which we expect to further 
      reduce our average costs per ton as the year progresses.

      Delivered shipments to our domestic and Asian customers decreased 
      slightly in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 due to rail 
      service issues on the northwest rail corridor. Along with weak 
      international market prices for seaborne thermal coal, this resulted in 
      lower revenue for the quarter. We have experienced increased demurrage 
      costs so far this year as ships were delayed at the terminal waiting for 
      coal. Recently, demurrage has been decreasing as we continued to work 
      closely with our customers, the BNSF Railway, and Westshore Terminals to 
      improve scheduling while rail delays continue. Our forward sales hedging 
      program mitigated some of the impact of lower spot prices with a 
      realized gain of $7.5 million in the second quarter.
    

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow


      Cash flow from operations totaled $22.6 million for the second quarter 
      of 2014. Capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest) were $2.6 
      million, none of which was financed under capital leases.
    

      For the first six months of 2014, operations generated cash flow of 
      almost $50 million (excluding the $14 million of refinancing costs paid 
      in the first quarter). Capital expenditures were $8.4 million (including 
      assets acquired under capital leases).
    

      As of June 30, 2014, unrestricted cash and investments were $225.5 
      million, and total available liquidity was $757 million.
    

      During the quarter, we received approval from the Wyoming Department of 
      Environmental Quality to self-bond and release $200 million of the 
      surety bonds held to cover reclamation obligations in accordance with 
      Wyoming regulations. The approval to release and self bond this amount 
      is a reflection of our balance sheet strength and will also help us save 
      around $2 million per year in surety premium costs.
    

Outlook


      Based on data from the Energy Information Administration, through April 
      2014, U.S. electric generation from coal-fired power was up seven 
      percent and coal consumption was 291 million tons, up 18 million tons 
      compared to last year. We understand that inventory levels vary 
      significantly from utility to utility, with some having very low levels 
      forcing them to conserve their coal burn. Total electricity generation 
      is up four percent while natural gas generation was down three percent, 
      which emphasizes the importance of coal-fired generation as a reliable, 
      low-cost energy source for the U.S.
    

      During the second quarter of 2014, domestic coal market fundamentals 
      continued to be favorable, but the lingering performance issues with the 
      western railroads have forced several utilities to conserve coal during 
      the quarter in anticipation of normal summer burn requirements. Even 
      with utilities conserving coal, inventories are at the lowest levels in 
      many years. Due to a slow start to the summer cooling season and 
      increased gas production, natural gas storage is recovering from very 
      low levels at the end of the winter. Natural gas prices have remained 
      consistently above $3.50/mmBtu, making PRB coal economic where it is 
      available.
    

      Domestic utility stockpiles of PRB coal are estimated to have fallen to 
      62 million tons at the end of June 2014, down 18 percent or 14 million 
      tons from a year ago. We and our customers will continue to focus on 
      ensuring the rail delivery of their contracted coal. So far this year, 
      we have seen an increase in requests for additional coal for delivery 
      this year. As we are fully sold out for 2014, we have not been bidding 
      on these requests.
    

      While shipments over the first half of the year have been disappointing, 
      we continue to expect an improvement in deliveries in the second half of 
      the year. With the planned improved deliveries, we believe that prices 
      will be supported based on fundamentals of strong coal consumption, well 
      below normal coal inventories and more sustainable natural gas prices.
    

      Internationally, we continue to see strong demand from our Asian 
      customers, which continues to be met by increased supply from projects 
      commissioned several years ago leading to current weak pricing. During 
      the first half of 2014, we saw strong interest in Spring Creek coal in 
      our primary focused markets of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan as they 
      work to increase generation in the face of growing demand and reduced 
      nuclear generation. These countries are moving ahead with numerous 
      projects to build additional modern coal-fired generation, which will be 
      designed to consume high-grade subbituminous coal, including our 
      benchmark Spring Creek coal.
    

      For 2014, we have contracted to sell 89 million tons from our three 
      owned and operated mines. Of this committed 2014 production, 86 million 
      tons are under fixed-price contracts with a weighted-average price of 
      $13.05 per ton. During the quarter, we fixed prices on approximately 3 
      million tons of previously contracted indexed coal for 2014 deliveries 
      at an average price of approximately $11.93 per ton.
    

      For 2015, we have currently committed to sell 61 million tons from our 
      three owned and operated mines. Of this committed 2015 production, 48 
      million tons are under fixed-price contracts with a weighted-average 
      price of $13.22 per ton. During the quarter, we contracted approximately 
      10 million tons for 2015 delivery at an average price of $12.00 per ton 
      reflecting the mix between 8,400 Btu and 8,800 Btu coal and prevailing 
      market prices.
    

      We are continuing to forecast 2014 export shipments through Westshore of 
      between 4.0 and 4.5 million tons. Demand from our international 
      customers continues to be strong, and we continue to seek to fill all 
      available capacity at Westshore while working to minimize demurrage 
      costs due to rail interruptions delaying shipments. At current 
      international pricing levels, there is little logistics margin available 
      on our export sales. However, we continue to benefit from the margins 
      realized by our Owned and Operated Mines segment and through our hedge 
      positions.
    

      As a result of our lower than expected second quarter shipments, we are 
      reducing our 2014 shipment guidance by one million tons to 85 to 89 
      million tons. This will still require an expected improvement in rail 
      performance through the end of the year. Due to the strong cost control 
      shown by the operations, we are maintaining our Adjusted EBITDA guidance 
      range of $180 to $210 million for the full year. We are reducing our 
      capital expenditure range by approximately $15 million to a new range of 
      $30 to $40 million.
    

      Marshall commented, “During the quarter, we were able to manage costs 
      well despite lower than expected shipments to produce a solid Adjusted 
      EBITDA result. We have also been able to maintain our strong balance 
      sheet and liquidity position to secure ourselves against the risk of a 
      delayed market improvement. Looking forward, our customers are keen to 
      take their contracted coal to rebuild their stockpiles in time for 
      winter, and our mines are well positioned with stripping and inventory 
      to supply the coal as long as rail performance improves as anticipated. 
      We are optimistic that the second half of the year will improve over the 
      first half and that increased shipments will allow coal burn to 
      normalize leading to improved pricing for future years.”

      or that we currently believe are not material. We make forward-looking 
      statements based on currently available information, and we assume no 
      obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      This release and our related presentation include the non-GAAP financial 
      measures of (1) Adjusted EBITDA (on a consolidated basis and for our 
      reporting segments) and (2) Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted 
      EPS”). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are intended to provide 
      additional information only and do not have any standard meaning 
      prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. 
      (“GAAP”). A quantitative reconciliation of historical net income (loss) 
      to Adjusted EBITDA and EPS (as defined below) to Adjusted EPS is found 
      in the tables accompanying this release.
    

      EBITDA represents net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing 
      operations, as applicable, before (1) interest income (expense) net, (2) 
      income tax provision, (3) depreciation and depletion, (4) amortization, 
      and (5) accretion. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted 
      to exclude specifically identified items that management believes do not 
      directly reflect our core operations. For the periods presented herein, 
      the specifically identified items are: (1) adjustments to exclude the 
      updates to the tax agreement liability, including tax impacts of our 
      2009 initial public offering and 2010 secondary offering, (2) 
      adjustments for derivative financial instruments, excluding fair value 
      mark-to-market gains or losses and including cash amounts received or 
      paid, and (3) adjustments to exclude a significant broker contract that 
      expired in the first quarter of 2010. Because of the inherent 
      uncertainty related to the items identified above, management does not 
      believe it is able to provide a meaningful forecast of the comparable 
      GAAP measures or reconciliation to any forecasted GAAP measures.
    

      Adjusted EPS represents diluted earnings (loss) per common share 
      attributable to controlling interest, or diluted earnings (loss) per 
      common share attributable to controlling interest from continuing 
      operations, as applicable (“EPS”), adjusted to exclude (i) the estimated 
      per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to 
      calculate Adjusted EBITDA as described above, and (ii) the cash and 
      non-cash interest expense associated with the early retirement of debt 
      and refinancing transactions. All items are adjusted at the statutory 
      tax rate of approximately 36 percent.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is an additional tool intended to assist our management 
      in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of 
      business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that 
      management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating 
      operating performance, comparing performance across periods, planning 
      and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels 
      of operating and capital investments. Period-to-period comparisons of 
      Adjusted EBITDA are intended to help our management identify and assess 
      additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be 
      shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss) or 
      income (loss) from continuing operations. Our chief operating decision 
      maker uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of segment performance. 
      Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also used as part of our incentive 
      compensation program for our executive officers and others.
    

      We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are also useful to 
      investors, analysts and other external users of our consolidated 
      financial statements in evaluating our operating performance from period 
      to period and comparing our performance to similar operating results of 
      other relevant companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure a 
      company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest 
      expense, taxes, depreciation and depletion, amortization and accretion 
      and other specifically identified items that are not considered to 
      directly reflect our core operations. Similarly, we believe our use of 
      Adjusted EPS provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our 
      performance across periods given that this measure provides an 
      adjustment for certain specifically identified significant items that 
      are not considered to directly reflect our core operations, the 
      magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and, 
      thereby, have a disproportionate effect on the earnings per share 
      reported for a given period.
    

      Our management recognizes that using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS as 
      performance measures has inherent limitations as compared to net income 
      (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS or other GAAP 
      financial measures, as these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, 
      including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to 
      investors. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in 
      isolation and do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss), 
      income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS or other GAAP financial 
      measures as a measure of our operating performance. Because not all 
      companies use identical calculations, our presentations of Adjusted 
      EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled 
      measures of other companies. Moreover, our presentation of Adjusted 
      EBITDA is different than EBITDA as defined in our debt financing 
      agreements.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.80      Net Money Flow ($)  -92,019    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

          Calculated by subtracting the average cost per ton sold from the 
          realized price per ton sold.
        















           
        




        Net income (loss) of $(20.1) million, Adjusted EBITDA of $20.4 
        million, and an average cost of $9.78 per ton, were all improved 
        results as compared to the first quarter of 2016.
      

        Exported 0.5 million tons during the first quarter and have contracted 
        3.3 million total tons of Asian export sales to be delivered in 2017.
      

        The Company received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and 
        commissions, of $64.7 million on the issuance of 13.5 million shares 
        of common stock. Equity issuance proceeds funded the full $64.5 
        million redemption of the outstanding 2019 Senior Notes. These 
        transactions resulted in a reduction in outstanding long-term debt and 
        no debt maturities until 2021.
      

        Ended the quarter with total available liquidity of $455 million.
      


      Colin Marshall, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our 
      lower operating costs reflect the many cost control and efficiency 
      initiatives we put in place during 2016 to adapt to lower shipments. We 
      delivered a solid operational and financial performance in the first 
      quarter as the industry environment continued to improve. During the 
      quarter, we continued to increase our export shipments, although the 
      volume ramp-up was challenged by severe weather in the Pacific Northwest 
      that negatively impacted rail performance. We currently have contracted 
      3.3 million tons to be exported during 2017, with additional sales 
      anticipated as the year progresses.”
    

Health, Safety, and Environment


      During the first quarter of 2017, of the Company’s approximately 1,150 
      full-time mine site employees, there was one reportable injury resulting 
      in a Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) All Injury Frequency 
      Rate (“AIFR”) of 0.34. During the 36 MSHA inspector days at the mine 
      sites during the quarter, the Company received one significant and 
      substantial citation with an assessment totaling $934.
    

      There were no reportable environmental incidents during the quarter.

      Shipments during the first quarter of 2017 were stronger than the first 
      quarter of 2016, supported by higher natural gas prices of around $3.00 
      per MMBtu. Utility coal-fired power plants continued to run during the 
      quarter and drew down coal inventories, although not as much as 
      anticipated due to the very mild winter.
    

      Revenue from the Owned and Operated Mines segment increased four percent 
      in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due 
      to higher shipments, partially offset by lower average realized prices 
      per ton. Cost per ton improved to $9.78 for the first quarter of 2017 
      compared with $11.15 for the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year 
      improvement was driven by increased shipments and the cost reduction and 
      efficiency measures taken during 2016.

      The Company exported 0.5 million tons to Asian customers during the 
      first quarter of 2017. This reflected the continued start-up of export 
      shipments announced in the third quarter of 2016, driven by increased 
      international thermal coal demand and pricing. Adjusted EBITDA includes 
      certain minimum payments pursuant to the Company’s new rail and port 
      agreements and unexpectedly high demurrage charges caused by rail delays 
      moving the coal to the terminal. The Company has currently contracted 
      3.3 million tons to export during 2017 and is planning to export 
      approximately 5 million tons during the full year, which will largely be 
      dependent on rail and port performance and prevailing prices.
    

Cash, Liquidity, and Financial Position


      Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 were $100.5 million. 
      During the first quarter, the cash inflow from operations totaled $19.7 
      million, while capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest) 
      used $4.1 million.
    

      At March 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the A/R 
      Securitization Program, which had an available borrowing capacity of 
      approximately $22 million. On January 31, 2017, the A/R Securitization 
      Program was amended to extend the term to January 23, 2020 to allow for 
      the ability to issue letters of credit and to reduce the combined 
      maximum borrowing capacity, subject to terms and conditions, for both 
      cash and letters of credit to $70 million.
    

      At March 31, 2017, the available borrowing capacity under the $400 
      million Credit Agreement was approximately $332 million, which reflects 
      approximately $68 million of outstanding, undrawn letters of credit used 
      as collateral for its reclamation bonds. The Company ended the quarter 
      with total available liquidity of $455 million.
    

      Throughout 2016 and early 2017, the Company made considerable progress 
      improving its financial position, as it exited reclamation self-bonding, 
      completed Exchange Offers on its senior notes, and renegotiated the 
      throughput contracts with Westshore and BNSF. During the quarter, the 
      Company issued 13.5 million shares of common stock for proceeds, net of 
      underwriting discounts and commissions, of $64.7 million. These proceeds 
      were used to retire the remaining 2019 Senior Notes, which were 
      redeemed, including a premium of 101.417 and accrued and unpaid 
      interest, for a total payment of $64.5 million. The Company now has no 
      debt maturities until 2021.
    

Government Affairs


      The early actions of the Trump administration and Congress have brought 
      some welcome regulatory relief for the industry. The overturning of the 
      Stream Protection Rule using the Congressional Review Act and the recent 
      Executive Orders that directed a review of the Waters of the U.S. rule 
      and the Clean Power Plan, the lifting of the federal coal-leasing 
      moratorium and halting of the associated Programmatic Environmental 
      Impact Statement will help U.S. coal producers. The suspension and 
      re-evaluation of the 2017 federal coal valuation rule is also a positive 
      change for the Company’s export logistics business as the Department of 
      the Interior reverts to the previous long-standing methodology during 
      this re-evaluation and removes the complexity and uncertainty that the 
      new rule would have introduced. These actions are important and welcome, 
      serving to add predictability and eliminate new and unnecessary costs 
      for mining operations. Looking forward, the Company is optimistic that 
      Congress and the current administration will support the development and 
      commercialization of advanced coal technology, as well as establish a 
      regulatory framework that gives utilities the confidence to invest in 
      the nation’s critical coal power plant fleet, which provides safe, 
      reliable and affordable electricity across the U.S.
    

Domestic Outlook


      Mine shipments to domestic customers for the first quarter were 13.5 
      million tons, in line with customer schedules and reflecting the usual 
      seasonal suspension of shipments on the Great Lakes. With natural gas 
      prices around $3.00 per MMBtu, utilities have maintained their 
      consumption levels of PRB coal and are taking their contracted coal. The 
      latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) 
      shows that natural gas inventories have declined by 368 BCF, or 14.8 
      percent, due to winter heating demand and reduced production, compared 
      to 2016 levels. Energy Ventures Analysis (“EVA”) estimates that PRB coal 
      inventories at utilities were 82 million tons as of the end of the first 
      quarter of 2017, a decline of 15 million tons from first quarter 2016 
      levels. Unfortunately, the very mild winter prevented PRB stockpiles 
      from declining further, resulting in continued elevated levels. Full 
      year shipments will largely depend on the level of summer cooling 
      demand, natural gas prices and associated coal burn. These factors will 
      dictate the level of third quarter coal buying and shipments utilities 
      require in preparation for winter.
    

      For 2017, the Company is currently planning to ship between 55 and 60 
      million tons, with current commitments to sell 56 million tons, which 
      includes 3.3 million tons with export customers. Of this committed 
      production, 55 million tons are under fixed-price contracts with a 
      weighted-average price of $12.19 per ton. The approximately 2 million 
      committed tons for 2017 that the Company priced during the first quarter 
      of 2017 were at an average price of $11.39 per ton, in line with the 
      prevailing prices at that time.
    

      The Company is currently contracted to sell 29 million tons in 2018, all 
      to domestic customers. Of this committed production, 27 million tons are 
      under fixed-price contracts with a weighted-average price of $12.51 per 
      ton. Utilities continue to delay new coal purchases due to their 
      elevated stockpiles after the very mild winter. While this maximizes 
      their flexibility, it could lead to some price support for coal during 
      periods of increased natural gas prices and electricity demand.
    

      “The current outlook for U.S. thermal coal producers is a lot brighter 
      than it was at this time last year. After good first quarter shipments, 
      many of our customers are indicating that they will continue to take 
      their contracted tons and will buy more coal for in-year delivery, if 
      summer demand is elevated. We remain optimistic that the PRB could see 
      year-over-year demand grow by approximately 10 million tons or more if 
      natural gas prices remain above $3.00 per MMBtu, and we have a normal 
      summer,” said Marshall.
    

International Outlook


      International thermal coal prices remained solid during the first 
      quarter of 2017 as China continued to manage its domestic production 
      levels and increase imports. This left international coal supplies 
      better matched to demand. Disruptions to Australian coal producers 
      caused by Cyclone Debbie in late March are forecast to impact the rail 
      system until early May. While metallurgical coal prices have risen 
      rapidly, Newcastle thermal coal prices have stabilized above $80 per 
      tonne. It will take some time for the full impacts of the disruption 
      from Cyclone Debbie to work their way through the system as buyers wait 
      for supply to resume or find alternative coal sources.
    

      Sustained international prices have allowed the Company to book export 
      sales of 3.3 million tons for delivery throughout 2017. Strong demand 
      should allow total 2017 export sales volumes of approximately 5 million 
      tons dependent on the capacity of the rail and port system to increase 
      shipment rates. The Company continues to receive strong interest from 
      Asian customers for its Spring Creek coal and will seek to layer in 
      sales for the remainder of 2017 as opportunities arise.
    

2017 Guidance – Financial and Operational Estimates


      “First quarter shipments showed a marked improvement over the first 
      quarter of 2016, with solid demand from both domestic and international 
      customers. Although the early end to winter and export rail challenges 
      negatively impacted our performance, we are now looking ahead to steady 
      summer demand and normalized export rail performance. While 2017 will 
      hold plenty of challenges, including a traditionally soft second 
      quarter, the actions we took in 2016 to control our costs and improve 
      our financial position mean we are well placed to successfully manage 
      through the current environment and prosper as it improves,” commented 
      Marshall.
    

      As explained in the February 2017 earnings call, reaching the top of the 
      Adjusted EBITDA range would have required an increase in the price of 
      export sales from then prevailing levels. To reflect year-to-date sales 
      made since then, the Company is lowering the top end of its Adjusted 
      EBITDA guidance range by $10 million to $110 million. The following 
      table provides the current outlook and assumptions for selected 2017 
      consolidated financial and operational metrics:

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements


      This release and our related quarterly investor presentation contain 
      “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor 
      provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are 
      not statements of historical facts and often contain words such as 
      “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” 
      “plan,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or words of 
      similar meaning. Forward-looking statements may include, for example: 
      (1) our outlook for 2017 and future periods for Cloud Peak Energy, the 
      Powder River Basin (“PRB”) and the industry in general; (2) our 
      operational, financial and shipment guidance, including export 
      shipments; (3) estimated thermal coal demand by domestic and Asian 
      utilities; (4) coal stockpile and natural gas storage levels and the 
      impacts on future demand and pricing; (5) our ability to sell additional 
      tons in 2017 and future periods at improved, economic prices; (6) the 
      impact of the Trump administration energy policies, ongoing state, local 
      and international anti-coal regulatory and political developments, NGO 
      activities and global climate change initiatives; (7) potential 
      commercialization of carbon capture technologies for utilities; (8) the 
      impact of competition from other domestic and international coal 
      producers, natural gas supplies and other alternative sources of energy 
      used to generate electricity; (9) the timing and extent of any sustained 
      recovery for depressed coal industry conditions, domestically and 
      internationally; (10) the impact of industry conditions on our financial 
      performance, liquidity and compliance with the financial covenants in 
      our Credit Agreement; (11) our ability to manage our take-or-pay 
      exposure for currently committed port and rail capacity; (12) our future 
      liquidity and access to sources of capital and credit to support our 
      existing operations and growth opportunities, including our ability to 
      renew or replace our credit facility before its early 2019 termination; 
      (13) the impact of our hedging programs; (14) our ability to renew or 
      obtain surety bonds to meet regulatory requirements; (15) our cost 
      management efforts; (16) operational plans for our mines; (17) business 
      development and growth initiatives; (18) our plans to acquire additional 
      coal to maintain and extend our mine lives; (19) our estimates of the 
      quality and quantity of economic coal associated with our development 
      projects, the potential development of our Youngs Creek and other 
      Northern PRB assets, and our potential exercise of options for Crow 
      Tribal coal; (20) potential development of additional export terminal 
      capacity and increased future access to existing or new capacity; (21) 
      industry estimates of the U.S. Energy Information Administration and 
      other third party sources; and (22) other statements regarding our 
      current plans, strategies, expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates 
      and prospects concerning our business, operating results, financial 
      condition, industry, economic conditions, government regulations, energy 
      policies and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical 
      facts.
    

      These statements are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and 
      assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results 
      to differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in 
      the forward-looking statements. The following factors are among those 
      that may cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from 
      our forward-looking statements: (1) the timing and extent of any 
      sustained recovery in the coal industry, domestically and 
      internationally, and the impact of ongoing or further depressed industry 
      conditions on our financial performance, liquidity and financial 
      covenant compliance; (2) the prices we receive for our coal and 
      logistics services, our ability to effectively execute our forward sales 
      strategy, and changes in utility purchasing patterns resulting in 
      decreased long term purchases of coal; (3) the timing of reductions or 
      increases in customer coal inventories; (4) our ability to obtain new 
      coal sales agreements on favorable terms, to resolve customer requests 
      for reductions or deferrals, and to respond to any cancellations of 
      their committed volumes on terms that preserve the amount and timing of 
      our forecasted economic value; (5) the impact of increasingly variable 
      and less predictable demand for thermal coal based on natural gas 
      prices, summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth 
      rates and other factors that impact overall demand for electricity; (6) 
      our ability to efficiently and safely conduct our mining operations and 
      to adjust our planned production levels to respond to market conditions 
      and effectively manage the costs of our operations; (7) competition with 
      other producers of coal and with traders and re-sellers of coal, 
      including the current oversupply of thermal coal, the impacts of 
      currency exchange rate fluctuations and the strong U.S. dollar, and 
      government environmental, energy and tax policies and regulations that 
      make foreign coal producers more competitive for international 
      transactions; (8) the impact of coal industry bankruptcies on our 
      competitive position relative to other companies who have recently 
      emerged from bankruptcy with reduced leverage and potentially reduced 
      operating costs; (9) competition with natural gas, wind, solar and other 
      non-coal energy resources, which may continue to increase as a result of 
      low domestic natural gas prices, the declining cost of renewables, and 
      due to environmental, energy and tax policies, regulations, subsidies 
      and other government actions that encourage or mandate use of 
      alternative energy sources; (10) coal-fired power plant capacity and 
      utilization, including the impact of climate change and other 
      environmental regulations and initiatives, energy policies, political 
      pressures, NGO activities, international treaties or agreements and 
      other factors that may cause domestic and international electric 
      utilities to continue to phase out or close existing coal-fired power 
      plants, reduce or eliminate construction of any new coal-fired power 
      plants, or reduce consumption of coal from the PRB; (11) the failure of 
      economic, commercially available carbon capture technology to be 
      developed and adopted by utilities in a timely manner; (12) the impact 
      of “keep coal in the ground” campaigns and other well-funded, anti-coal 
      initiatives by environmental activist groups and others targeting 
      substantially all aspects of our industry; (13) our ability to offset 
      declining U.S. demand for coal and achieve longer term growth in our 
      business through our logistics revenue and export sales, including the 
      significant impact of Chinese and Indian thermal coal import demand and 
      production levels from other basins on overall seaborne coal prices; 
      (14) railroad, export terminal and other transportation performance, 
      costs and availability, including the availability of sufficient and 
      reliable rail capacity to transport PRB coal, the development of future 
      export terminal capacity and our ability to access capacity on 
      commercially reasonable terms; (15) the impact of our rail and terminal 
      take-or-pay commitments if we do not meet our required export shipment 
      obligations; (16) weather conditions and weather-related damage that 
      impact our mining operations, our customers, or transportation 
      infrastructure; (17) operational, geological, equipment, permit, labor, 
      and other risks inherent in surface coal mining; (18) future development 
      or operating costs for our development projects exceeding our 
      expectations; (19) our ability to successfully acquire coal and 
      appropriate land access rights at economic prices and in a timely manner 
      and our ability to effectively resolve issues with conflicting mineral 
      development that may impact our mine plans; (20) the impact of asset 
      impairment charges if required as a result of challenging industry 
      conditions or other factors; (21) our plans and objectives for future 
      operations and the development of additional coal reserves, including 
      risks associated with acquisitions; (22) the impact of current and 
      future environmental, health, safety, endangered species and other laws, 
      regulations, treaties, executive orders, court decisions or governmental 
      policies, or changes in interpretations thereof and third-party 
      regulatory challenges, including additional requirements, uncertainties, 
      costs, liabilities or restrictions adversely affecting the use, demand 
      or price for coal, our mining operations or the logistics, 
      transportation, or terminal industries; (23) the impact of required 
      regulatory processes and approvals to lease coal and obtain permits for 
      coal mining operations or to transport coal to domestic and foreign 
      customers, including third-party legal challenges to regulatory 
      approvals that are required for some or all of our current or planned 
      mining activities; (24) any increases in rates or changes in regulatory 
      interpretations or assessment methodologies with respect to royalties or 
      severance and production taxes and the potential impact of associated 
      interest and penalties; (25) inaccurately estimating the costs or timing 
      of our reclamation and mine closure obligations and our assumptions 
      underlying reclamation and mine closure obligations; (26) our ability to 
      obtain required surety bonds and provide any associated collateral on 
      commercially reasonable terms; (27) the availability of, disruptions in 
      delivery or increases in pricing from third-party vendors of raw 
      materials, capital equipment and consumables which are necessary for our 
      operations, such as explosives, petroleum-based fuel, tires, steel, and 
      rubber; (28) our assumptions concerning coal reserve estimates; (29) our 
      relationships with, and other conditions affecting, our customers 
      (including our largest customers who account for a significant portion 
      of our total revenue) and other counterparties, including economic 
      conditions and the credit performance and credit risks associated with 
      our customers and other counterparties, such as traders, brokers, and 
      lenders under our Credit Agreement and financial institutions with whom 
      we maintain accounts or enter hedging arrangements; (30) the results of 
      our hedging programs and changes in the fair value of derivative 
      financial instruments that are not accounted for as hedges; (31) the 
      terms and restrictions of our indebtedness; (32) liquidity constraints, 
      access to capital and credit markets and availability and costs of 
      credit, surety bonds, letters of credit, and insurance, including risks 
      resulting from the cost or unavailability of financing due to debt and 
      equity capital and credit market conditions for the coal sector or in 
      general, changes in our credit rating, our compliance with the covenants 
      in our debt agreements, the increasing credit pressures on our industry 
      due to industry conditions, or any demands for increased collateral by 
      our surety bond providers; (33) volatility in the price of our common 
      stock, including the impact of any delisting of our stock from the New 
      York Stock Exchange if we fail to meet the minimum average closing price 
      listing standard; (34) our liquidity, results of operations, and 
      financial condition generally, including amounts of working capital that 
      are available; (35) litigation and other contingent liabilities; (36) 
      the authority of federal and state regulatory authorities to order any 
      of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain 
      circumstances; and (37) other risk factors or cautionary language 
      described from time to time in the reports and registration statements 
      we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those in 
      Item 1A - Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and any updates 
      thereto in our Forms 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
    

      Additional factors, events or uncertainties that may emerge from time to 
      time, or those that we currently deem to be immaterial, could cause our 
      actual results to differ, and it is not possible for us to predict all 
      of them. We make forward-looking statements based on currently available 
      information, and we assume no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any 
      obligation to, update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements 
      made in this release or our related quarterly investor presentation, 
      whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, 
      except as required by law.
    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      This release and our related presentation include the non-GAAP financial 
      measure of Adjusted EBITDA (on a consolidated basis and for our 
      reporting segments). Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide additional 
      information only and does not have any standard meaning prescribed by 
      generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of 
      America. (“U.S. GAAP”). A quantitative reconciliation of historical net 
      income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is found in the tables accompanying 
      this release. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before: (1) interest 
      income (expense), net, (2) income tax provision, (3) depreciation and 
      depletion, and (4) amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as 
      further adjusted for accretion, which represents non-cash increases in 
      asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of 
      time, and specifically identified items that management believes do not 
      directly reflect our core operations. For the periods presented herein, 
      the specifically identified items are: (1) adjustments to exclude 
      non-cash impairment charges, (2) adjustments for derivative financial 
      instruments, excluding fair value mark-to-market gains or losses and 
      including cash amounts received or paid, (3) adjustments to exclude debt 
      restructuring costs, and (4) non-cash throughput amortization expense 
      related to payments made to amend the BNSF and Westshore agreements. We 
      enter into certain derivative financial instruments such as put options 
      that require the payment of premiums at contract inception. The 
      reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the 
      mark-to-market gains or losses. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA does 
      not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments; either 
      at contract inception, as these payments pertain to future settlement 
      periods, or in the period of contract settlement, as the payment 
      occurred in a preceding period. In prior years the amortization of port 
      and rail contract termination payments were included as part of EBITDA 
      and Adjusted EBITDA because the cash payments approximated the amount of 
      amortization being taken during the year. During 2017, management 
      determined that the non-cash portion of amortization arising from 
      payments made in prior years as well as the amortization of contract 
      termination payments should be adjusted out of EBITDA because the 
      ongoing cash payments are now significantly smaller than the overall 
      amortization of these payments and no longer reflect the transactional 
      results. Because of the inherent uncertainty related to the items 
      identified above, management does not believe it is able to provide a 
      meaningful forecast of the comparable GAAP measures or reconciliation to 
      any forecasted GAAP measure.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is an additional tool intended to assist our management 
      in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of 
      business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that 
      management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating 
      operating performance, comparing performance across periods, planning 
      and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels 
      of operating and capital investments. Period-to-period comparisons of 
      Adjusted EBITDA are intended to help our management identify and assess 
      additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be 
      shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss). 
      Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also used as part of our incentive 
      compensation program for our executive officers and others.
    

      We believe Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors, analysts and 
      other external users of our consolidated financial statements in 
      evaluating our operating performance from period to period and comparing 
      our performance to similar operating results of other relevant 
      companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure a company’s 
      operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, 
      taxes, depreciation and depletion, amortization and accretion and other 
      specifically identified items that are not considered to directly 
      reflect our core operations.
    

      Our management recognizes that using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance 
      measure has inherent limitations as compared to net income (loss) or 
      other GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain 
      items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be 
      meaningful to investors. As a result of these exclusions, Adjusted 
      EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be 
      an alternative to net income (loss) or other GAAP financial measures as 
      a measure of our operating performance. Because not all companies use 
      identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
