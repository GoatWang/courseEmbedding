As many of you may already know, Fitchburg State University’s President Robert V. Antonucci announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year. While the student body has been pre-occupied with academics, athletics, club meetings and typical Thursday nights on Highland, Antonucci has been putting all of his time and dedication into making the Fitchburg State campus a better place for each one of us. His vision and leadership has had a profound impact on both the campus and the larger North Central Massachusetts region and here is how it all began…
Eleven years ago, a man of Italian heritage named Robert V. Antonucci decided to fulfill the role as President of Fitchburg State University. He made this decision after having a long history of working in education. However, many of us do not know that Antonucci has had an extremely successful and busy professional life beyond his work as university president. Antonucci discussed how his father had immigrated as a young man from a small farming community near Rome.
As the first generation in his family to attend college, Antonucci decided to begin his career by obtaining an education at Fitchburg State College, receiving a Bachelor of Science Education with a Minor in Science and Math. He also has a doctorate of education from Boston University and holds honorary degrees from Endicott College and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. After graduation, his career involved employment in various jobs in the field of education. He taught in Lunenburg for seven years as assistant principal. He continued his career in Leominster from 1974-1980 as an Assistant Superintendent and then headed to Falmouth, MA to take the position of Superintendent of Schools.
Robert V. Antonucci was an education commissioner in the 1990’s and played a key role in the passage of the state’s historic Education Reform Act of 1993. He is a former president of the Riverdeep Learning Company, which is a leading provider of electronic educational software, and he has held positions such as president and chief executive officer with the Harcourt Higher Education and California College for Health Sciences.
To add to his amazing community work, he was chair of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges strategic planning initiative as well as the State University System of Massachusetts Council of Presidents. After his time as comissioner, he decided to venture into a different line of work with a five-year stint in the private sector where he worked with a national publishing company.
In 2003, he came back again to Fitchburg State University to act as the President, a decision he felt was highly influential. “I love leadership, I like administration.” he said. “I came back to my Alma mater. I took a positive step in attempting to make that happen and it did happen, and it was probably one of the best decisions I made in my whole academic career.” Since his start, enrollment has increased greatly, academic programs have been added, online programs have multiplied and major fundraising campaigns have been completed. Antonucci was also a leader in the successful effort to rename the state colleges as universities.
“I think the college has changed significantly in the last 11 years. We invested a lot of money into making the campus a lot more adaptable to students.” Antonucci said. He then went on to list projects such as the Science Building, the North Hike Fields and the new Nursing Lab as some of those accomplishments. Under Antonucci’s reign the dining commons have been renovated, our aging athletic facilities have been converted into top of the line stadiums, and technological initiatives have been constructed including the establishment of a wireless campus.
There has been a total upgrade of computer laboratories and many new classrooms have been added that allow technological access for faculty and students alike. Historic buildings were renovated and we have branched campus buildings onto North Street where the science center opened in 2013. This was the first new academic building to be built on the Fitchburg State campus in 30 years!
Antonucci had made a promise to strengthen the university’s commitment to the city of Fitchburg and he kept his word. The university has purchased many distressed properties, has constructed a new police station on campus, and has relocated the Professional Studies office to Main Street. The university has taken over control of the Wallace Civic Center and has beautified the arena, which had aged greatly.
Over the past few years and to this day, a major renovation of the campus center has been happening which has provided additional academic space and has made the campus more aesthetically welcoming to prospective students.
As a part of the Fitchburg State student body, we may not have been aware of Antonucci’s amazing community accomplishments, but we have been able to see the beneficial changes that have occurred around our campus over the last 11 years.
“It would be difficult to overstate the impact President Antonucci has had on this institution,” said Board of Trustees Chairman Carol T. Vittorioso. “He has overseen what is likely to be the most extensive transformation of the campus in its 120-year history.”
President Antonucci shows a great love and enthusiasm for Fitchburg State University and its students. He very much wants everyone working and studying on campus to have the best possible experience here. Antonucci broke down what he thought needs to be done in order for the university to continue thriving. “ The University needs to focus on teaching, learning, and service. If you look at the Rec Building, the same banners that I had when I first came here were about teaching, learning, and service. Those are our basic principles.”
Antonucci also said that students play a major role in the university’s success. “Without students, we don’t have a university. Everything that the President does, the faculty does, the administrators do really should revolve around making the student experience much more positive.” He also explained the final element to be taken into consideration. “Take a good look at the capital of facilities here. I think college has changed significantly in the last eleven years.” he said.
Upon taking the position, Antonucci knew the job would not be easy. “This job as president requires you to be on duty twenty-four seven, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, if you do it right.” he said.
One of Antonucci’s plans before leaving Fitchburg State is to begin to combat the smoking problem on campus. He mentioned that he was aware that there is a smoking problem in the school, but that it must be handled delicately. Although, some people are upset by the habit, he also has to consider the rights and feelings of the smokers. He said that the first step is to put signs on all the buildings that prohibit smoking within 25 feet of that building. The rest of the process might have to land in the hands of the next President.
Though he is retiring this year and plants to spend time with his five grandsons, President Antonucci still believes that he will help the college, considering his experience. He feels that he could continue to act as a resource and be a positive influence.“I will keep active and I will keep busy, and hopefully, I will stay linked with Fitchburg, and if I can help them in any way, I will.”
It is apparent that our President Antonucci has set the bar very high for any potential Fitchburg State University presidents in our campus’ future. He has been dedicated to making this campus the best it could possibly be and he has been successful in all of these endeavors. Antonucci has gone above and beyond, around this community and surrounding communities, to make education beneficial for all, which no doubt contributes to the successful programs we have here at Fitchburg State.
As students at Fitchburg State, we are grateful for the growth of our campus over the past 11 years under Antonucci’s watch. We can only hope that during this 2014-2015 academic year, the Board of Trustees may choose a new President to continue the beneficial work that has been accomplished during the Antonucci legacy and choose someone who is as influential to individual students as Antonucci has been.
We hope that we will have a president that is as involved as President Antonucci has been. One specific student, Shelby Tozier says, “The president personally appeared on my radio show junior year. I was so thankful. It really helped me stay with clubs and want to succeed, knowing that our president genuinely cared.”
So we thank you Dr. Antonucci, for your years of hard work and dedication to this institution and to all who are apart of it. You made a large impact on everyone and your presence as our President will never be forgotten.

President Antonucci to retire in 2015

          Posted 05/19/14
          


Fitchburg State University President Robert V. Antonucci, whose vision and leadership have had a profound impact on both the campus and the larger North Central Massachusetts region, today announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year.
“I am honored to have been chosen to lead this great university and its dedicated faculty and staff, and thankful to have served under a supportive and talented Board of Trustees,” Antonucci wrote in a letter to the campus community. “I value the past 11 years as the most rewarding of my professional life.”
Antonucci, Fitchburg State’s 10th president, made the initial announcement before a campus gathering in Hammond Hall. He noted that he was announcing his intentions now to allow as much time as possible for a broad national search.
“It would be difficult to overstate the impact President Antonucci has had on this institution,” said  Board of Trustees Chairman Carol T. Vittorioso. “He has overseen what is likely the most extensive transformation of the campus in its 120-year history. Moreover, he has advanced our stature, our academic position and our interaction with communities near and far. I look forward to working with him in his final year at Fitchburg State as we embark on a search for a new president to continue the university’s progress.”
Of the search process, due to begin in earnest at the start of the fall semester, Vittorioso said, “It will be open and transparent, with all voices heard. This institution and the people who care so deeply about it deserve nothing less. I have no doubt that we are positioned to attract high-quality applicants.”
Addressing the coming year, Antonucci said in his message, “I assure you that I will be as fully engaged as ever. There is much to be done, and I will continue to work with all of you until my last day as president.”
Antonucci, former Massachusetts commissioner of education, began his tenure at Fitchburg State in June 2003. Since then, enrollment has increased, as have the number of full-time undergraduate faculty members. Academic programs have been revised or added, online programs have multiplied, and a major fundraising campaign was completed. Antonucci was also a leader in the successful effort to rename the comprehensive state colleges as universities.
Other accomplishments include the drafting of a new strategic plan, administrative reorganization, and completion of a host of capital projects. Historic buildings have been renovated with the latest technology and new spaces created to enhance the experience of student life. The science center on North Street, opened in 2013, was the first new academic structure to be built on campus in 30 years.
Additional projects include renovation of the dining commons, conversion of the university's aging outdoor athletic facilities into a professional-level stadium, and construction of a faculty teaching center in the library. Antonucci also embarked on an ambitious series of technology initiatives, including establishment of a “wireless” campus, a total upgrade of the computer laboratories, and the creation of dozens of new classrooms that allow faculty access to the latest technologies.
Early on, Antonucci made a commitment to strengthen the university’s commitment to the city of Fitchburg. The multi-year effort to create an attractive boulevard connecting the university’s central artery, North Street, with the city’s Main Street was accelerated with the purchase of several distressed properties, construction of a new campus police station, relocation of the Center for Professional Studies to Main Street and completion of the final phase of street beautification. A new exercise and sports science facility was also completed in the corridor. At the city’s request, the university assumed control of the Wallace Civic Center and refurbished the aging ice arena.
A major renovation of the university’s campus center was completed in 2012. In an effort to provide additional academic space, Antonucci worked with the university’s foundation to purchase an off-campus building that now houses many of the institution’s auxiliary services.
Antonucci has significantly increased the university’s visibility in Boston as well as the local region, meeting frequently with elected officials, members of the Department of Higher Education and other state agencies. Governor Deval Patrick appointed him to co-chair the Higher Education Task Force and to serve as a member of the Pre-K through 12 Task Force. Subsequently he was appointed by the governor to chair the University of Massachusetts and Public Higher Education subcommittee of the Readiness Project Leadership Council, and to serve as a member of the Workforce Standards and Performance Accountability Task Force.
As education commissioner in the 1990s, Antonucci played a key role in the passage and enactment of the state’s historic Education Reform Act of 1993, a landmark law now seen as a national model.
Antonucci is former president of the school group at Cambridge-based Riverdeep—The Learning Company, a leading provider of electronic educational software. He has also held the positions of president and chief executive officer with Harcourt Learning Direct and Harcourt Higher Education, and chief executive officer of Harcourt eLearning and the California College for Health Sciences. Harcourt was the first online college in Massachusetts granted authority to award bachelor and associate degrees.
For 12 years Antonucci was superintendent of schools in Falmouth, serving as the chief executive officer of the town's K-12 system. From 1974 to 1980, Antonucci served as assistant superintendent of the Leominster Public Schools. He began his career in education in 1967 as a teacher and administrator in Lunenburg.
A member of the NCAA Division III Chancellors/Presidents Council, he serves as a member of its Joint Legislative Steering Committee.
Antonucci is a trustee or director at Eastern Bank, Unitil, Fallon Clinic and Our Father’s House, as well as a corporator at Cape Cod Healthcare and the Greater Worcester Community Foundation. He is an elected town meeting member in Falmouth and a member of the board of directors of the United Way of North Central Massachusetts and former president of the Chamber of Commerce.
Antonucci has also chaired the New England Association of Schools and Colleges strategic planning initiative and the State University System of Massachusetts Council of Presidents.
He holds two degrees from Fitchburg State, and was presented with an honorary doctoral degree as well as the university’s Distinguished Alumnus Award. He holds a doctorate in education from Boston University, where he served as an adjunct faculty member from 1994 to 1998, teaching graduate courses on state and local politics and education. He also holds honorary degrees from Endicott College and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.
His wife, Jeanne, also holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Fitchburg State. The Antonuccis have a son, a daughter, and five grandchildren.
