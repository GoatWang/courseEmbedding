Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

I am on a fixed income. I have been working on my credit, so I know that I need a car and I need to start my own business. I am a leader and serious about my finances.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

How to Avoid Five Common M&A Pitfalls


What can go wrong with a merger or acquisition? Plenty. Here private equity expert Bruce R. Evans shares the top pitfalls of the M&A process and strategies for avoiding them.






By Bruce R. Evans

CREDIT: 










A combination of low interest rates, ready financing, and a strong economy have encouraged more and more midsize companies to seek growth through merger and acquisition (M&A). As a result, companies are using acquisitions to increase market share, broaden product offerings, enter new geographic markets, access emerging technology or intellectual property, and expand into new distribution channels.
Over the last 20 years, I have seen hundreds of M&A transactions succeed -- and more than a few fail. What can go wrong? Here are five of the most common pitfalls, along with strategies for avoiding them.
#1: Poor strategic fit
Oftentimes, an M&A transaction does not work because a company has strayed outside its core competencies -- the markets, products, customers, and technologies that it knows best. Sometimes, these differences are subtle. Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, for instance, both made cars, but served dramatically different customer bases with very distinct price and quality expectations. At other times, the differences are more blatant, as when a department store chain buys a brokerage firm, perhaps hoping to sell socks and stocks in the same aisles. Before settling on an acquisition target, acquirers must take a hard look at their core strengths, weaknesses, and strategies for growth. Instead of buying a company because it is available or attractive in its own right, make sure the acquisition fits into your company's overall strategy.
#2: Culture clash
Another problem occurs when you buy a company for its people -- research and development teams, technical experts, top sales people, or seasoned creative talent -- and then fail to provide an environment in which they can flourish. If you are not cautious, you could end up losing the people and owning the furniture. To avoid this pitfall, you need to ensure that your due diligence incorporates not only the hard numbers, but also the intangibles like culture and corporate structure. During the integration process, be sensitive to the expectations of the people whom you want to retain. Within reason, allow these professionals to maintain the culture that keeps them productive, even if it differs from your own. And, finally, don't expect to be able to make really radical adjustments. If the cultures are too different, you may just want to scrap the acquisition.
#3 Due diligence mistakes
Transactions can also fail because of problems that are not uncovered or are misjudged during your due diligence process. There are many ways to make mistakes in this regard. For example, at the time of the deal, you simply may not be aware of certain issues such as new competition or changes in the regulatory environment. Second, in some cases, you may have identified a potential problem, but misjudged its importance and decided to go ahead with the transaction anyway. Let us say, for example, that a lawsuit is pending against the company you are buying. Because your lawyers assure you that the case is likely to go in your favor, you buy the company -- and then lose the case. Careful due diligence could minimize such unexpected events, but it will not eliminate them. A degree of judgment and risk will be inherent in almost every M&A transaction.
#4: Betting the whole company
A fourth pitfall arises when an acquisition is so large or costly that its size or cost impacts the rest of the company in a negative way. For example, your company may have a high rate of growth. If you buy a large company that is growing much more slowly, that acquisition could drag down your entire firm's growth rate and could potentially negatively affect its valuation as well. Or, perhaps you take on too much leverage to buy a large company, and then have to cut back on growth initiatives to make your interest and principal payments. Most entrepreneurs are careful not to make acquisitions that jeopardize their core businesses. However, with financing so easy to come by these days, your company could be easily swept up in grand growth strategies that ultimately undermine your success.
#5: Not allocating enough resources
Successful acquirers treat their M&A activities as another business line. They make sure that they have experienced people in place for every stage of the deal -- from identifying acquisition candidates to performing due diligence to structuring deals to integrating the acquired company into their own. If you plan on acquiring a large number of companies, you should first establish a formal corporate development group that can handle smaller transactions on its own; then you can work closely with senior management on the larger transactions. You also may want to create a working team for integration, making sure that acquired companies will fit into your firm's overall strategy and operating structure.
When executed properly, M&A deals can be an important element of a company's growth strategy, allowing you to expand into new markets, product areas, and distribution channels. By ensuring that your transactions are aligned with corporate strategy, carefully investigated, thoughtfully integrated, appropriately sized, and sufficiently resourced, you can increase the success of your M&A program.
