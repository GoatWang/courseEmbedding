Lazarus Investment Partners LLLP Delivers Letter to Perceptron, Inc.




















November 09, 2011 07:00 ET

 | Source: Lazarus Investment Partners LLLP





DENVER, Nov. 9, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lazarus Investment Partners LLLP, the largest shareholder of Perceptron, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRCP) with ownership of approximately 9.4% of the outstanding shares, today announced that it delivered a letter to the Company's Chairman, Richard Marz, and the Company's CEO, Harry T Rittenour.

	The full text of the letter follows:



				November 8, 2011



				 



				Richard Marz, Chairman



				Harry T Rittenour, CEO



				 



				Perceptron, Inc.



				47827 Halyard Drive



				Plymouth, MI 48170-2461



	Gentlemen:

I am writing to the Board of Directors of the Company to request that Perceptron, Inc. ("PRCP" or "the Company") immediately engage a prominent investment bank with a clear mandate to sell part or all of the Company. 

	Lazarus Investment Partners LLLP currently owns approximately 9.4% of the outstanding shares of Perceptron. We believe this makes us the Company's largest shareholder. We have owned shares in the Company for over eight years. 

	PRCP's stock is deeply undervalued and meaningful opportunities exist to unlock shareholder value which are in the control of the Company's Board of Directors and management. Despite market-leading technology and valuable intellectual property, PRCP's stock has dramatically underperformed its peers and the overall market over an extended time period. We do not feel that the current slate of directors possess the requisite skill sets to assist the Company in evaluating opportunities to improve performance and shareholder value.

	I have approached the Company on a number of occasions and asked for some new perspective to be brought to the Board. Currently, the average tenure for the Board's directors is approximately 12 years. In fact, four directors, Mr. Oswald, Mr. DeCocco, Mr. Smith and Mr. Beattie, have served since July 1996 or July 1997 during which time shareholders have witnessed a decline in the value of their holdings of approximately 85% while the Russell 2000 has increased over 150%. The most recently appointed Board member, Mr. Ratigan, previously served on the board prior to 1996. Mr. Ratigan was a board member when the company went public, further demonstrating the Board's inability to go outside of a very shallow well for leadership direction. 

	I have also asked for the Company to utilize its sizeable cash position, currently around $2.65 per share, to create shareholder value or to return the money to the shareholders, yet the Company still has not been able to even achieve the previously announced $5 million stock buyback. Simply stated, we have had enough of the inertia that has enveloped the Company. I am tired of the same 'group think' that has only provided shareholders a decreased share price since the majority of the current directors joined the board. I am appalled at management and the Board's inability at monetizing significant intrinsic value of Perceptron's technology and intellectual property. I can no longer accept the persistent tunnel vision and inability to diversify and utilize the Company's technology outside of the auto sector and the current feeble and failing attempt in the construction and trade industry. Thus far, shareholders have no recognizable value for the millions of dollars in salaries and board fees we have born over the years. Enough is enough.

	For several years, management has invested in R&D with the promise that a new product is around the corner. Yet, sales have declined from $72.5 million in 2008 when the current Chairman and current CEO took control to $59.3 million in the last fiscal year. The share price has decreased approximately 50% over this time frame and the Company has only entered one new business line. The Company's diversification into the trade sector appears to not only be poorly timed, but ill-conceived with its first major vendor leaving the company. The CBU unit has cost the Company millions of dollars over the last three years in a failed attempt to diversify away from the auto sector. We encourage the Company to diversify and leverage its technological prowess, but pursuing the trade sector when the construction market is in freefall does not seem to be the diversification anyone would desire. Therefore, it is terribly disheartening to learn that our years of trust and patience have been in vain as management has instead expended millions of dollars worth of shareholder's assets and has not successfully diversified or grown the Company. 

	As we discussed with the management team on several occasions during 2011, since Perceptron went public nearly 20 years ago, the Company has created virtually ZERO shareholder value. During your time as Chairman, you have made in excess of $430,000 in cash compensation in addition to share grants. During his time as CEO, Mr. Rittenour has received in excess of $1.1 million in cash compensation in addition to share grants. In fact, Mr. Rittenour has received a generous raise every year since becoming CEO, even while the company has struggled during the economic downturn.

	It appears that the benefits reaped by the Company's customers, officers & directors, and employees, have come at the expense of its shareholders. Quarter after quarter, year after year, decade after decade, Perceptron has failed its shareholders and it is time to deliver the value for which the shareholder's have so patiently waited. I no longer have any confidence that management or the Board of Directors have the knowledge, interest or skill set necessary for creating shareholder value. A glaring example of management's apathy towards creating shareholder value can be seen on the Company's website where the investor presentation has not been updated since December, 2010. This lack of even the most fundamental investor relations effort is truly astonishing. 

	Frankly, the decades of dismal results and the current share price speak for itself. This is a public company and the Board of Directors of Perceptron has a fiduciary responsibility first and foremost to its shareholders. If management and the Board of Directors really believe that the Company is on the proper path to success and we (and the rest of the world) just don't get it, feel free to make the shareholders an offer and take the Company private.

	We are confident that Perceptron will find a prominent investment bank that is very eager to take on this transaction. The out-of-pocket expenses for engaging an investment bank to explore the sale of part of all of the Company will be minimal. We have nothing to lose and we can always turn down an offer we deem inadequate. It's time for change and we expect the Board to live up to its fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders and maximize the value of the Company. I have no interest in engaging in a proxy fight where the Company's management and Board of Directors squanders millions of PRCP's cash resources to protect their jobs. After eight long and frustrating years as a patient shareholder of this Company, I am simply requesting that we explore our strategic alternatives. I am very hopeful that management and the Board of Directors will comply with this request and we can continue a friendly and constructive dialogue with the Company.

	Please feel free to call me with any questions.

	Sincerely,



				Justin B. Borus



				Managing Partner

Punching Above Its Weight, Little-Known Pointer Telocation Has Multi-Bagger Potential






Disclosure: Long PNTR. Please read our full
disclaimer.



Pointer
     is a high quality business with recurring revenues, growth, profitability,
     and scale. 
Pointer
     trades at a low multiple in a growing industry that has high multiples. 
Pointer’s
     growth and margin plans, newly invigorated investor relations efforts, and
     acquisition potential are reasons we expect Pointer’s share price to
     appreciate materially. 
We
     provide an interview with the company’s CEO. 


Introduction. Pointer's (NASDAQ: PNTR) modest market
cap of $57 million makes the company easy to overlook by investors. But those
who take the time to look behind the market cap will find a profitable and
growing company with over $100 million in sales, $9 million in cash, and
innovative technology in a hot industry - and it just happens to trade at
around 7x earnings.

The Warren Buffett Of Flavors









Disclosure: Long Frutarom (the Tel Aviv listed shares). Please
read our full
disclaimer.



Ori Yehudai of Frutarom may be the best manager at the
best company you never heard of.







Frutarom's CEO, Ori Yehudai



For the past twenty-eight years, Ori Yehudai has been
quietly building an empire. Out of a nondescript office near the Mediterranean
Sea in Herzliya, Israel, Yehudai has grown Frutarom's sales from $3.5 million
in 1986 to $792 million in 2013, adjusted for acquisitions. He's targeting
crossing the $1 billion mark in the near future. Although few outside the
industry have heard of Frutarom, today it is one of the ten largest flavor and
fine ingredients companies in the world. Under Yehudai's leadership, investors
in Frutarom's 1996 IPO have made over 110x their money.

Catching Up With Barfresh's CEO: Others Can Only Dream Of What We Have









Disclosure: Long BRFH. Please read our full
disclaimer.



Summary

Barfresh
     has been quietly executing on its business plan. 
Barfresh’s
     agreement with Sysco, the largest food service company in the country, is
     a game changer. 
We
     provide an update interview with the company’s CEO. 


In December of last year, we explained why
we invested $2 million in a tiny, early stage company called Barfresh
(OTCQB:BRFH). Since that article we have added to our investment in the
company. Barfresh remains in the risk portion of our portfolio, yet we are
excited about what this company can turn into. We've heard more than one
investor call this company the next Green Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR).

Silver Bull has over $2 billion worth of zinc which it gets little credit for. Zinc is near a 3 year high.
        
We argue that even critics would have to agree that this company is worth multiples of its current market cap.

Ur-Energy: A Uranium Giant In The Making, Part 2





Disclosure: Long URG. Please read our full disclaimer.

Since December, Ur-Energy has transitioned from a development company to one of the largest domestic producers of uranium, with capacity to produce 20% of US supply this year.
The company has materially added to its resource, posted two quarters of solid production, and given strong guidance through 2015 yet the stock price is unchanged.
We explain the upside potential that convinced us to become a top shareholder of the company.
We provide an interview with the company’s Chairman highlighting progress at the company.

Cbeyond Won't See Beyond 2014





Disclosure: No position in CBEY. Please read our full disclaimer.
  
Cbeyond (CBEY)
 has some challenges, but it's too cheap to ignore. This telecom 
services company has had trouble growing and differentiating its 
technology, but still offers nearly half a billion dollars in revenue, a
 clean balance sheet, and an attractive customer base. It is also free 
cash flow positive and rather cheap, with a multiple of 2.9x EV/EBITDA. 
In November 2013 the company announced that it was forming a committee 
to explore strategic alternatives, which may include "a business 
combination or sale of the Company." We wouldn't be surprised if someone
 bit.

 SuperCom CEO: We Just Tripled Our Revenues And We're Only Getting Started 








Disclosure: Long SPCB. Please read our full disclaimer.





Every once in a while we walk out of
a first meeting with a management team and are interested in immediately buying
stock in the company they run. That was the feeling we had the first time we
met with the team from SuperCom (Nasdaq: SPCB). We were so intrigued by our initial visit
that we followed up the next day by returning to their office for a second
meeting. Weeks later we became one of the company's largest shareholders. 




What we saw, and still see, in
SuperCom is the rare combination of:



a highly incentivized management team with a track
     record of building shareholder value
a corporate turnaround to which the market was giving
     no credit
an acquisition (now complete) of the company's largest
     competitor that nearly triples the revenue base and grows EBITDA 2.5x
a recurring revenue model with long term visibility
a loyal customer base that's extremely sticky
growth opportunities that offer the prospect of
     multiplying the top line
a very low valuation

article on SuperCom here.
