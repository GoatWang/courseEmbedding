Meet Our Founders – Harry and Kay 



World of Children co-founders Harry Leibowitz and Kay Isaacson-Leibowitz led successful careers as senior executives before deciding to dedicate their lives to a shared passion: serving the needs of vulnerable children worldwide. They frequently visit our Honorees to see their work in action. Most recently, they traveled to South America, Rwanda, Nepal, Argentina, Ukraine and Haiti.
Harry Leibowitz, Ph.D.
“One little hand by one little hand, we will fulfill that sacred duty given to us by our forebearers — life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — for every child we can reach.”

Harry grew up with humble beginnings in Brooklyn, New York. Throughout World War II and into the early 1950s his family lived in an old bungalow on Coney Island where ten families shared a common bathroom. He began working long hours as soon as he became a teenager. Through these experiences, he developed an incredible work ethic and an appreciation for the plight of children born into challenging circumstances.
Harry went on to enjoy a successful business career, serving in senior executive positions at companies such as Procter & Gamble, ESMARK and also running his own marketing consultancy. His years of business travels around the world gave him a firsthand taste of the plight of children in developing countries and made a lasting impression.
In 1996, Harry had a vision for the World of Children when he was recovering from cancer surgery at age 55. Watching the Pulitzer Prize announcements on television, he realized that though there was a Pulitzer for art and literature, a Nobel Prize for the sciences and peace and an Oscar for motion pictures, there were no awards for those who were tirelessly serving vulnerable children.
That realization was a catalyst for Harry, and he subsequently founded the World of Children and pledged to dedicate the rest of his life to creating an Awards program to support heroes serving vulnerable children worldwide.
Harry’s honors include the Procter & Gamble Alumni Humanitarian Award in 2007, the Reclaiming Youth International Child Advocacy Award in 2006 and the Starr Commonwealth Child Advocacy Award in 1999. He has been featured in AWEARNESS by Kenneth Cole and The Humanitarian in Each of Us by Dr. Frank LaFasto and Dr. Carl Larson. Most recently, he was awarded the 2012 Ellis Island Medal of Honor.
Kay Isaacson-Leibowitz
“This is my passion and my life’s work, helping change the lives of vulnerable children and honor the heroes who dedicate their lives to these children.”

Kay was the daughter of an Air Force fighter pilot. She went to grade school in Taiwan and high school in Ethiopia, which afforded her the opportunity to understand how difficult life can be for children and families outside of the U.S.
Kay first entered the world of fashion after graduating from college and enjoyed a very successful 40-year-long career. She has served as an Executive Vice President for Victoria’s Secret Stores as acting President and Senior Vice President of Merchandising for Banana Republic. She also served as Chairman of the Advisory Board for City University of New York Honors College. Currently, Kay serves as an Independent Director on the Board of GUESS? (NYSE).
In addition to her leadership with the World of Children, Kay has also made significant contributions to a myriad of nonprofit organizations. She was instrumental in the early success of Brian’s House, a home for children with AIDS in Dallas, Texas.
Kay met Harry in 1999, who introduced her to the World of Children after it had been going for two years. She fell in love with Harry and the World of Children simultaneously.

December 1st, 2014
World of Children Co-Founder Selected for Honorary National Committee


Kay Isaacson-Leibowitz will join Tom Brokaw and other national leaders as an Honorary National Committee Member at upcoming celebration of World War II heroes.

 
December 1, 2014 – Longtime Rancho Santa Fe resident Kay Isaacson-Leibowitz, Co-Founder of World of Children (www.worldofchildren.org), has accepted an exclusive invitation to serve on the Honorary National Committee for the grand opening of The Road to Berlin: America’s Journey of Courage and Sacrifice at The National WWII Museum in New Orleans. Other Committee members include news anchor Tom Brokaw, Hank Greenberg (former Chairman of AIG), John Whitehead (former Deputy of State and Co-Chairman of Goldman Sachs), and Michael O’Neil (Chairman of Citigroup).
The museum will host a special celebration from December 10-12 to mark the grand opening of The Road to Berlin: America’s Journey of Courage and Sacrifice, a new gallery on the museum’s campus that is expected to attract worldwide attention from veterans and their families, corporate leaders and elected officials.
As a member of the Honorary National Committee for the The Road to Berlin: America’s Journey of Courage and Sacrifice, Isaacson-Leibowitz will attend the celebration and endorse the museum’s mission to ensure future generations can learn about the American experience of World War II and understand the price of freedom.
“Our family has been honored to serve our great country in almost every major conflict since the Civil War, and we are still serving today with my nephew as a Commander in the Navy,” Isaacson-Leibowitz said. “My father, Brigadier General Clayton, ‘Ike’, Isaacson, was a fighter pilot and an ACE in WWII having served in both theaters. So it is a special honor for me and my family to be a part of this outstanding tribute by the WWII Museum to our heroes. Accompanying me on this exciting and emotional journey will be my husband, Harry Leibowitz, my mom, Nona Isaacson and my sister and her husband, Marilyn and John Fairbairn.”
