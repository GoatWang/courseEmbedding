Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

About Petrus
Get the Full Story






Chateau Petrus, from a prime vineyard on well-drained clay soil atop the Pomerol plateau, has for decades stood as the world's greatest example of Merlot. Petrus's rise to the top, however, was rather meteoric, happening all at once in the second half of the 20th century.
Chateau Petrus, which is really not a Chateau at all, just a two-story farmhouse 40km from Bordeaux, dates to the mid 18th century. The golden age of Petrus, however, didn't begin until after World War II, when Madame Edmond Loubat became sole proprietor of the estate. Under her direction, Petrus became one of the first estates in Bordeaux to implement green harvesting -- a technique used to lower crop yields and increase concentration in mature berries. The terroir, unique to the 28 acre site at Petrus, produces a wine that is extraordinarily creamy and thick but with the substantial tannic underpinning to ensure decades of development in bottle.
The panoply of exotic aromas and flavors typically encompasses black raspberry, mulberry, iron, cocoa powder, truffle and expensive new oak. Petrus bottlings are generally 100% Merlot, although some vintages will contain 2-3% of Cabernet Franc. The vineyard itself is planted to 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. An average vintage produces only 2500 cases of the Grand Vin and no second wine. This limited supply accounts for much of the astronomical price of a Petrus bottle.
In 2007, After 44 seasons as Technical Director at Petrus, Jean Claude Berrouet retired and was replaced by Eric Murisasco. Berrouet's son, Olivier Berrouet, is winemaker at Petrus and is currently in training to assume the position of Technical Director.

“Wonderfully Drinkable” Gambero Rosso
When Gambero Rosso’s annual wine guide drops, the Italian wine world stops, as winemakers scan the influential Italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes. Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is a perennial Gambero favorite, having earned multiple “Due Bicchieri” (“Two Glasses”) honors in addition to praise as a “sincere, wonderfully drinkable wine.” The Wine Access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more, and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent 2015 vintage by the case. 
The land of Badia di Morrona in the picturesque hills between Florence and Pisa was first worked by 11th century Benedictine monks. Today it is owned by Count Gaslini Alberti, who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past 50 years, outfitting winemaker Corrado Dal Piaz with a refurbished facility, enlarged cellars, and new casks and barrels.
Dal Piaz is notoriously hard on the Badia’s 282 acres of grapes, which soak up the sun on south- and south-eastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone. He tightened spacing in the vines, orchestrating a Darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skin-to-juice ratio. The result is Sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity.
2015’s long growing season allowed temperamental Sangiovese to reach rare, almost perfectly uniform maturity. The vines stretched deep underground, sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil, putting out a dark, crushed-red-fruit Sangiovese, infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins.
If you’re looking for vibrancy in your top-class Chianti, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything quite like this luscious 2015. At $13.99 (and as Gambero Rosso would advise), this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation.








Tasting Notes



WineAccess Travel Log
The 2015 Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is bright ruby to the edge, with a fabulous nose of wild berry, blue flower, and tangy spices. Juicy and high-toned on the attack, with sneaky weight and supple texture. This is textbook Chianti.

Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.
