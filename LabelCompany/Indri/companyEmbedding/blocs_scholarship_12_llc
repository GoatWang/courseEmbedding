Who is Scholarships4Moms?

FreeCollegeScholarships, LLC was founded in 2005 and operates an education and media online business. We have been awarding $10,000 scholarships since 2005 and in this time we've awarded over $1,000,000 in scholarships. The Scholarship money is provided by us, we’re able to award the scholarship because we show advertisements for colleges and universities as well as other educational services on our website. We uphold the values and requirements for both the Better Business Bureau and privacy companies to maintain our memberships each year.


What is the entry process?
Entry for the scholarship and our school matching service is quick and easy.

Next, if you choose, you can view offers available from the colleges and universities advertising on our site. You can request information from these schools and they will contact you with more information. This is not a required step to complete your entry. Be sure to check your email for the confirmation message.


This sounds too good to be true, what's the catch?
This is real, and entry, which is used to connect students with education programs, is free. We award a new winner on a quarterly basis. Since 2005, we have awarded over $1,000,000. But, don't take it from us, hear what our winners have to say: Here


How is my information used?
The quality, transparency and security of this site have been certified by the BBB(Better Business Bureau) and privacy companies, and we collect only what information we operationally require. Before submitting personal information, please read our privacy policy for information on how we gather and use what information you submit.


How many people enter to win the scholarship?
There are no limits on the number of entrants we can accept within each entry time frame. The number of eligible applicants varies for each drawing date but it is approximately 1:250,000. One winner will be selected by a random drawing from all eligible pooled from our multiple websites.


How can I use my money if I win?
Winners of our scholarship can use the money for any educational opportunity. Some past winners have used the money to help pay for college tuition, books or paying off student loans. Please note that a scholarship is tax free only if you are a candidate for a degree at an eligible education institution. An eligible education institution is one that provides a program that is acceptable for full credit towards a bachelors or higher degree, or offers a program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation; and is authorized under federal or state law to provide such a program and is accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation agency. The prize money must be used for qualified education expenses for the original entrant.
Qualified education expenses do not include the cost of room and board, travel, research, clerical help, or equipment and other expenses that are not required for enrollment in or attendance in an eligible education institution.


Do I have to use the $10K money for a specific school or program?
If you're the lucky winner, you are required to use the scholarship to pay for education and/or related expenses. We do not require you to be enrolled in a particular college or university, but you do need to be a student or planning to enroll within 3 months to be eligible. Upon winning the prize money, you must provide proof of enrollment otherwise you will be deemed ineligible to receive the prize money. Previous winners have used the money for college tuition, books or paying off student loans.


Do I have to pay it back?
Nope! The $10,000 scholarship is funded by Free College Scholarships and is not a loan. You may need to pay taxes on the prize, however.


How will I know if I'm the winner?
If you are selected as the winner of our $10,000 giveaway, we will contact you directly either by email, telephone, regular U.S. postal mail, or by overnight carrier. If we cannot contact you after reasonable effort within two days after our first attempt to contact you, we will select an alternate winner.


Do I need to sign up with the schools to be qualified for the scholarship?
No it is not a requirement to sign up with a school. You are not obligated to accept free information from our sponsors, and your chances of being awarded our scholarship will not be affected. You are not obligated to purchase any product or services, regardless of whether you request any free information from our sponsors. However, if you're interested in going back to school, you can request information during the entry process.
