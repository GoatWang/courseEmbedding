About Us



            About Us
            







A Proud Legacy







Thematic Approach







The GA Difference







GA Value Add







Philanthropy












Dedicated to Growth Equity Since 1980 Helping growing businesses rise to new heights is our purpose and our passion. Drawing from over three decades of experience investing in 250 growth companies, we focus exclusively on partnering with exceptional companies that have proven business models and strong revenue growth in dynamic industries. Today we have $20 billion in assets under management, as of June 30, 2016. We know that fast-growing businesses are different. They face a unique set of challenges and opportunities. Many are at an inflection point in their development, looking for a patient and strategic partner to help themtransform from an ascending star into an enduring market leader. 




 
Serving as a steady and strategic co-pilot, we help our portfolio companies manage and accelerate their growth by seizing new opportunities, mitigating risks, and preparing to scale their business models.Our firm was founded as a family office for a single entrepreneur who enlisted our team to help fellow entrepreneurs build great companies and enable others to invest in innovation and growth. Today, we remain true to our original mission. We are committed to helping high-quality companies achieve unprecedented, long-term success. And, by doing that, we stay committed to helping our capital partners — more than half of whom are families — achieve their investment objectives.

General Atlantic was founded in 1980 as the captive investment team inside of Atlantic Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Charles F. Feeney a co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers Group who became one of the world’s leading living philanthropists. Two of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, credit Feeney as a major inspiration for both the $30 billion-strong Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Giving Pledge, which has enlisted more than 90 of the world’s richest to (eventually) grant half their wealth to charity.[5][6]
The firm was initially led by CEO Edwin Cohen, previously a partner of McKinsey & Company. Cohen was joined by Steven A. Denning, also from McKinsey & Company, as a founding member of the firm. Steven Denning served as General Atlantic’s CEO from 1995 to 2006 and currently serves as GA’s Chairman. Today, William (Bill) E. Ford, who joined the firm in 1991, is the current CEO of General Atlantic LLC.[7]
General Atlantic focused initially on investments in computer software, oil and gas exploration, real estate and retailing. Among the firm's first major investments was United Health Services, which tripled in value in three years for the firm. By the late 1980s, General Atlantic began to expand its funding sources to include other family offices, as well as foundations and endowments.[8]
Coincident with General Atlantic's expansion of its funding source, the firm began exploring expanding its presence overseas. Starting in 2000, General Atlantic began to open offices in Europe and Asia and currently has 11 offices globally.[9]

General Atlantic Reportedly In Talks To Buy 74% Stake In Karvy Computershare
Jun 19 17
General Atlantic LLC is in advanced talks to purchase a stake of about 74% in Karvy Computershare Private Limited for roughly INR 15 billion, two people with direct knowledge of the plan said. Computershare Limited (ASX:CPU), which owns half the company, will sell its entire stake while Indian partner and Karvy Group owner C Parthasarathy will sell around 24%, the people said. Computershare is contemplating the move as part of its global strategy of exiting non-core businesses. “It will sell its 50% stake through this transaction while C Parthasarathy will cede a significantly minority stake to give the incoming investor a larger stake and control of the board,” said one of the persons cited above. The deal, once concluded, will value the company at around INR 20 billion-INR 21 billion. The spokesperson for General Atlantic declined comment while the spokespersons for Karvy and Computershare did not respond to emailed queries.

General Atlantic to sell SnapAV to H&F


June 20, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






Hellman & Friedman LLC has agreed to acquire Charlotte, North Carolina-based SnapAV, a provider of audio/video, security, networking, and automation products. The seller is General Atlantic. No financial terms were disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. UBS Investment Bank and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey served as M&A advisers to Hellman & Friedman while Evercore Partners did likewise for General Atlantic.
PRESS RELEASE
Charlotte, NC – June 20, 2017 – SnapAV, a leading vertically-integrated supplier in the rapidly growing connected home sector, today announced that affiliates of Hellman & Friedman LLC (“H&F”) have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the company from General Atlantic.
SnapAV sells proprietary-branded audio/video (“AV”), security, networking, and automation products to residential and commercial AV, security and technology integrators. These integrators in turn serve “DoIt-For-Me” consumers, selling, installing and integrating SnapAV’s products as part of a custom home solution. The company wholesales approximately 2,700 SKUs across 14 proprietary brands and serves integrators across the United States with outstanding eCommerce, customer service and support capabilities—enabling its dealer customers to operate more confidently, more efficiently and ultimately more profitably. 





John Heyman, CEO of SnapAV, said: “Our broad, high-quality product lineup and ability to anticipate and support our dealers’ needs has been critical to our success. We know what dealers want and how to make their job easier, and our logistics system ensures they get what they need fast and at the right price. Responding to our customers, we have expanded into the networking, surveillance and remote cloud management categories, and created a one-stop solution for technology integrators. We thank General Atlantic for their contributions to SnapAV’s growth and development over the past four years and welcome Hellman & Friedman as our new partner.
Hellman & Friedman’s industry expertise and outstanding track record of helping companies like us grow will serve us well as we continue to execute on our strategy of providing great products and exceptional service to our dealer customers.”
“SnapAV’s innovative eCommerce platform, compelling products and excellent service deliver tremendous value to the integrator community,” said Erik Ragatz, Managing Director of Hellman & Friedman. “With its network of loyal dealers and an outstanding base of employees, SnapAV is very well positioned to continue on its growth trajectory. We look forward to partnering with John and the rest of the management team as the company moves into its next phase of growth.”
Mark Dzialga, Managing Director at General Atlantic, said, “We have been pleased to support SnapAV through a period of substantial growth and appreciate our strong partnership with the management team. As SnapAV enters its next phase of development, we are confident the company is in great hands with Hellman & Friedman and we look forward to watching its future success. 





The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017. Additional terms were not disclosed.
UBS Investment Bank and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey acted as M&A advisors to Hellman & Friedman on the transaction. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP acted as legal counsel to Hellman & Friedman. Evercore Partners acted as M&A advisors and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP acted as legal counsel to General Atlantic.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'

General Atlantic was founded in 1980 as the captive investment team inside of Atlantic Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Charles F. Feeney a co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers Group who became one of the world’s leading living philanthropists. Two of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, credit Feeney as a major inspiration for both the $30 billion-strong Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Giving Pledge, which has enlisted more than 90 of the world’s richest to (eventually) grant half their wealth to charity.[5][6]
The firm was initially led by CEO Edwin Cohen, previously a partner of McKinsey & Company. Cohen was joined by Steven A. Denning, also from McKinsey & Company, as a founding member of the firm. Steven Denning served as General Atlantic’s CEO from 1995 to 2006 and currently serves as GA’s Chairman. Today, William (Bill) E. Ford, who joined the firm in 1991, is the current CEO of General Atlantic LLC.[7]
General Atlantic focused initially on investments in computer software, oil and gas exploration, real estate and retailing. Among the firm's first major investments was United Health Services, which tripled in value in three years for the firm. By the late 1980s, General Atlantic began to expand its funding sources to include other family offices, as well as foundations and endowments.[8]
Coincident with General Atlantic's expansion of its funding source, the firm began exploring expanding its presence overseas. Starting in 2000, General Atlantic began to open offices in Europe and Asia and currently has 11 offices globally.[9]

General Atlantic was founded in 1980 as the captive investment team inside of Atlantic Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Charles F. Feeney a co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers Group who became one of the world’s leading living philanthropists. Two of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, credit Feeney as a major inspiration for both the $30 billion-strong Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Giving Pledge, which has enlisted more than 90 of the world’s richest to (eventually) grant half their wealth to charity.[5][6]
The firm was initially led by CEO Edwin Cohen, previously a partner of McKinsey & Company. Cohen was joined by Steven A. Denning, also from McKinsey & Company, as a founding member of the firm. Steven Denning served as General Atlantic’s CEO from 1995 to 2006 and currently serves as GA’s Chairman. Today, William (Bill) E. Ford, who joined the firm in 1991, is the current CEO of General Atlantic LLC.[7]
General Atlantic focused initially on investments in computer software, oil and gas exploration, real estate and retailing. Among the firm's first major investments was United Health Services, which tripled in value in three years for the firm. By the late 1980s, General Atlantic began to expand its funding sources to include other family offices, as well as foundations and endowments.[8]
Coincident with General Atlantic's expansion of its funding source, the firm began exploring expanding its presence overseas. Starting in 2000, General Atlantic began to open offices in Europe and Asia and currently has 11 offices globally.[9]

General Atlantic was founded in 1980 as the captive investment team inside of Atlantic Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Charles F. Feeney a co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers Group who became one of the world’s leading living philanthropists. Two of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, credit Feeney as a major inspiration for both the $30 billion-strong Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Giving Pledge, which has enlisted more than 90 of the world’s richest to (eventually) grant half their wealth to charity.[5][6]
The firm was initially led by CEO Edwin Cohen, previously a partner of McKinsey & Company. Cohen was joined by Steven A. Denning, also from McKinsey & Company, as a founding member of the firm. Steven Denning served as General Atlantic’s CEO from 1995 to 2006 and currently serves as GA’s Chairman. Today, William (Bill) E. Ford, who joined the firm in 1991, is the current CEO of General Atlantic LLC.[7]
General Atlantic focused initially on investments in computer software, oil and gas exploration, real estate and retailing. Among the firm's first major investments was United Health Services, which tripled in value in three years for the firm. By the late 1980s, General Atlantic began to expand its funding sources to include other family offices, as well as foundations and endowments.[8]
Coincident with General Atlantic's expansion of its funding source, the firm began exploring expanding its presence overseas. Starting in 2000, General Atlantic began to open offices in Europe and Asia and currently has 11 offices globally.[9]
