The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 2,500,000 Shares offered at a
public Offering price of $0.02 per share will vary depending upon the total
number of Shares sold. Regardless of the number of Shares sold, we expect to
incur Offering expenses estimated at approximately $11,500, consisting of
$10,000 for legal, accounting, and $1,500 of other costs in connection with this
Offering (estimated transfer agent fees). The table below shows the intended net
proceeds from this Offering that we expect to receive for scenarios where we
sell various amounts of the Shares. Since we are making this Offering without
any minimum requirement, there is no guarantee that we will be successful at
selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus. Accordingly, the
actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this Offering, if any, may differ.

None of the proceeds from this Offering will be used to pay the salaries to our
officers and directors.

transfer agent fees relating to the Offering. Our Officers and Directors will
not receive any compensation for their efforts in selling our Shares.

We intend to use the proceeds of this Offering in the manner and in order of
priority set forth above. We do not intend to use the proceeds to acquire assets
or finance the acquisition of other businesses. At present, no material changes
are contemplated. Should there be any material changes in the projected use of
proceeds in connection with this Offering, we will issue an amended prospectus
reflecting the new uses.

In all instances, after the effectiveness of this Registration Statement, the
Company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general
existence and comply with its public reporting obligations. Our Company
estimates that we will need approximately an additional $10,000 per year to
cover additional expenses for public reporting, legal fees, accounting,
auditing, and transfer of agent fees. The Company recognizes that if it does not
raise net proceeds of at least $18,500 in this Offering, it will have to seek
additional funds to cover these expenses. The $18,500 in net proceeds that we
need to stay in business for twelve months is comprised of (i) $1,000 for
existing liabilities, (ii) $7,500 for web design and social media marketing
expenses, and (iii) $10,000 for SEC reporting expenses. While the existing
liabilities on our balance sheet also include $17,250 in shareholder loans, the
shareholder loans do not have a fixed repayment date, and the Offering costs
will also be paid out of the gross proceeds from the Offering.  The net proceeds
from the Offering will not be used to pay either of these liabilities.

Up and until 23% raised of the Offering , the Use of proceeds raised $11,500
(23% * 2,500,000 * 0.02 ) will be used to pay the offering expenses and no funds
will be available for continuing to operate the Company.

40% raised = net $8,500 will enable the Company to continue as a public Company.

60% raised = net $18,500 will enable the Company to start initiating its
business plan.

The Company will fail if it does not raise a minimum of net proceeds of $8,500
and the Director will not be able to fund the Company.

In addition to changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received,
we may change the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business
plan. Investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of
proceeds. Therefore, management decisions may not be in line with the initial
objectives of investors, who will have little ability to influence these
decisions.


There are two main areas of competition for the Caleminder Inc. web-based
calendar reminder service. The first area includes greeting card manufacturers
such as Hallmark Cards Inc. and American Greetings Corporation. While both of
these companies have websites that offer ecards, otherwise known as electronic
cards, neither side offers the calendar functionality that we hope to include in
our service. While in the initial stages of development their sites are more
developed and offer more customization of the cards being sent electronically,
our long-range plans also include extensive customization options.

In addition to these two major competitors, there are a large number of websites
in the greeting card industry in the United States, ranging from small
organizations to large national and international companies. With the expansion
of the Internet as a distribution channel for greeting cards with digital
photographs and other personalized content, the competition has increased
tremendously.


Company Description
Our company has developed a business plan for an online service that provides 
a calendar- based greeting and reminder service to assist subscribers in 
remembering important life events such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc.

The Company operates out of Israel however the web application will be


 available
worldwide.

Users will register with the system and enter these important dates as well as
configure a variety of settings, including how they want to be notified, for
example by email or by text message or via Facebook or other social media tools;
when they want to be notified, for example one month prior, two weeks prior, one
week prior, etc. The user can also designate contacts as belonging to specific
user groups such as Friends, Family, Professional Contact. These user groups
will be customizable. The content of the reminder can also be customized so that
the user can either enter all the relevant details, or leave the reminder
cryptic so as not to alert others to the upcoming event. Many of the settings
will be one-time preferences while other fields will need to be customized per
reminder set. A series of reports will be made available to the end-user to
indicate what reminders are pending, already sent, etc. Because the website will
run entirely on the Cloud, end-users will not be required to download any
application.

The company plans to work with an outside web developer to create the
programming, back office and infrastructure, as well as the look and feel of the
website. We plan to work with marketing and social media experts to determine
the best way to promote the site and brand our offering. We will also need to
hire user interface experts to optimize the graphic user interface.

We plan to monetize the site through several means including topic-based
advertisement; local, national, global and corporate sponsors, and more. While
the base service will be free to end-users, additional for-pay services will be
added. These will include not only the reminder messages that are free, but the
ability to configure automatic emails that will be sent on the day of the event
– birthday, anniversary, etc. to another person. We believe we can create an
interface that will enable the end-user to customize many factors within the
notification. We will offer the for-pay users the opportunity to upload a video
or tape an audio message that will be attached to the email or included in a
link. A full set of for-pay end-user benefits will need to be discussed with the
development agency we hire. Some of the initially planned features may need to
be shifted to later development cycles.

Certain features of the proposed services may not be developed without proper
funding.

In the early stages, we plan to develop template-like options that enable a user
to upload digital photographs, logos, etc. to customize templates that can be
saved and reused when needed. Each template will be created via a Template
Editor. Ideally, the Template Editor will have a graphic “What You See Is What
You Get” interface that enables the user to drag and drop elements to customize
the template. The user should be able to control the font, color and size of
text, move graphics around, and more.

At the same time, for users who feel that they are less creative, the Caleminder
service should include some basic samples that can quickly be modified by adding
a name, user address, and event title and quickly generate and send the
appropriate card.

development stage company.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
250% Stock Dividend
 
The Board of Directors Caleminder Inc. (the
“Company”), has declared a 3.5-for-one split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a 250% stock dividend
(the “Stock Dividend”), payable on June 30, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 15,
2017. The Stock Dividend will be an additional two and one-half shares of common stock for every share held.
 
The Stock Dividend will become effective with
FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and in the marketplace at the open of business on July 3, 2017, whereupon the
common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis under the trading symbol “CMNDD” for a period of 20 business
days. After such 20-day period, the “D” will be removed from the trading symbol, which will revert to the original
symbol of “CMND”. No fractional shares will be issued to stockholders in connection with the Stock Dividend. In lieu
of fractional shares, stockholders will receive cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying $1.25 by the fraction
of a share to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled.
 
The Company currently has 10,000,000 shares
of common stock outstanding and will have approximately 35,000,000 shares outstanding as a result of the Stock Dividend.
 
SEC Investigation
 
On or about June 1, 2017 (i) current management
of the Company became aware that the Company is the subject of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), and (ii) the Company and David Lamadrid, its Chief Executive Officer, received requests from the SEC to provide
it with certain documents in connection with such investigation. Management has now learned that the investigation has been ongoing
since at least January 2016, and focuses on the offer and sale of securities by the Company prior to the purchase of a controlling
interest in the Company by the current stockholders and the appointment of current management in May 2017. Current management of
the Company did not become aware of the investigation until June 2017. The Company and Mr. Lamadrid are cooperating fully with
the SEC.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2017



	(Unaudited)


	 




	NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS




	 


	Caleminder Inc. (the “Company”)
	was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on May 28, 2014. The Company has not yet realized any revenues from its
	planned operations.


	 


	The Company’s sole operations since
	inception have been limited to the development of an online calendar-based greeting and reminder service. In connection with the
	change in control described in Note 7 below, the Company intends to become a vertically integrated producer and distributor of
	medical-grade cannabis products. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in executing its business
	plan.


	 


	The Company’s activities are subject
	to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company’s
	business plan.



	 





	NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	PRACTICES






	 






	Basis of Accounting




	 


	The Company’s condensed financial statements
	are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end.


	 


	In the opinion of management, the accompanying
	unaudited condensed financial statements of Caleminder Inc. contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company’s
	financial position as of March 31, 2017 and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended March 31, 2017. The
	accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q.
	The results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
	the full year.




	 






	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.




	 






	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.




	 






	Income Taxes




	 


	A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded
	for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense
	(benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced
	by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
	tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
	on the date of enactment.


	 






	 


	 

	4



	 







	 




	 


	When required, the Company records a liability
	for unrecognized tax positions, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and
	the benefits recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater
	than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not
	meet this threshold. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability.


	 


	The Company recognizes penalties and interest
	associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related tax
	liability in the balance sheet. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest as of March 31, 2017.




	 






	Loss per Share




	 


	The basic loss per share is calculated by
	dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss)
	per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
	The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially
	dilutive debt or equity. The Company has not issued any potentially dilutive debt or equity securities.




	 






	Recently issued accounting pronouncements




	 


	The Company does not believe that there are
	any new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results
	of operations.



	 





	NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES




	 


	The Company uses the liability method, where
	deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
	the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. As of March 31, 2017 and
	2016, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss
	carry-forward has been fully reserved. As of March 31, 2017 the cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $99,000
	and will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred.



	 





	NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT






	 






	Authorized




	 


	The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000
	shares of $0.0001 par value common stock. All common shares have equal voting rights, are non-assessable and have one vote per
	share. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they choose
	to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company.




	 






	Issued and Outstanding




	 


	On June 1, 2014, the Company issued 7,500,000
	common shares to its sole stockholder for cash consideration of $0.0001 per share. The proceeds of $750 were received on June
	27, 2014.


	 


	On February 9, 2015, the Company issued 2,500,000
	shares of common stock for $50,000 as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC, at an offering price of $0.02 per share.



	 





	NOTE 5. GOING CONCERN




	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has no revenues, and an accumulated deficit
	of approximately $99,000. This condition among others raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain
	additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	Management is planning to raise funds through
	debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.

	NOTE 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS




	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
	loans from the Company’s principal stockholder amounted to $31,571 and $31,064, respectively, and represent working capital
	advances. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. In connection with the change in control described
	in Note 7 below, the stockholder released the Company from its obligations to repay these advances.


	 






	NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	 







	Change in Control





	 


	On May 1, 2017, Shira Halperin, the holder
	of 7,500,000 shares (the “Restricted Shares”) of common stock of the Company, representing 75% of the Company’s
	outstanding shares, sold all of such shares to certain third parties, including (i) Pure Harvest Cannabis Producers Inc., a Nevada
	corporation (“Pure Harvest”), which purchased 5,486,041 of the Restricted Shares, and (ii) David Lamadrid, the sole
	shareholder and officer of Pure Harvest, who purchased 428,572 of the Restricted Shares.


	 


	Concurrently with the closing of the sale
	of the Restricted Shares, holders of an aggregate of 2,495,000 shares (the “Unrestricted Shares”) of common stock
	sold such shares to certain third parties, including Pure Harvest, which purchased 656,816 of the Unrestricted Shares.


	 


	Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement
	between Shira Halperin and Pure Harvest under which the Restricted Shares were sold (i) David Lamadrid was appointed as a director,
	and as the Chief Executive Officer and President, of the Company, and (ii) Shira Halperin resigned as an officer of the Company
	and agreed to resign as director of the Company upon request by Pure Harvest.


	 


	Pursuant to agreements entered into by Pure
	Harvest with certain purchasers of the Unrestricted Shares, Pure Harvest agreed to submit to the Company for cancellation all
	6,142,857 shares purchased by it.

	Item 2. Management ’
	s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations.



	 


	As used in this Form 10-Q, references to “
	Caleminder , the ” Company, ” “ we, ” “ our ” or “ us ” refer to Caleminder Inc.,
	unless the context otherwise indicates.


	 




	Forward-Looking Statements




	 


	The following discussion should be read in
	conjunction with our unaudited financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q (the “ Report ”
	). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some
	cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “ may, ” “ should, ” “
	expects, ” “ plans, ” “ anticipates, ” “ believes, ” “ estimates, ” “
	predicts, ” “ potential ” or “ continue ” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
	These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our
	or our industry ’ s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
	future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.


	 




	Corporate Background and Business Overview




	 


	We were incorporated in the State of Delaware
	on May 28, 2014 and are a development stage company. The Company’s sole operations since inception have been limited to
	the development of an online calendar-based greeting and reminder service. In connection with the change in control described
	in Note 7 above, the Company intends to become a vertically integrated producer and distributor of medical-grade cannabis products.
	However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in executing its business plan.


	 




	Employees




	 


	Other than our current director and officer,
	we have no employees.




	 





	Results of Operations



	 



	Results of operations for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 




	Revenues



	 


	During the three months period ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016 we have not generated any revenue.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	The Company’s operating expenses for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $8,356 and $8,742, respectively. The operating expenses primarily consisted
	of professional fees, legal, auditing and other consulting fees associated with SEC compliance.


	 


	We expect to continue to incur significant
	operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur.
	Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the
	future.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017
	and 2016 the Company recognized net losses of $8,356 and $8,742, respectively.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	Our cash balance as of March 31, 2017 was
	$1,653, which is not sufficient to support our operations for the next 12 months.


	 


	Historically, we have financed our cash flow
	and operations from the sale of common stock and loans from a related party.  Net cash provided by financing activities
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $507 and $6,900, respectively.


	 


	We have not generated any revenue from our
	operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds may be raised through equity financing,
	debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We currently do not
	have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent
	upon our ability to obtain financing and generate revenue. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in
	a significant dilution to our stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase
	our liabilities and future cash commitments.   We will require additional funds to maintain our reporting status
	with the SEC.

	Going Concern Consideration




	 


	We have incurred net losses since our inception
	through March 31, 2017 totaling $98,814 and have completed only the preliminary stages of our business plan.  We anticipate
	incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing
	obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.  Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the
	issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain.  Accordingly, our independent auditors’
	report on our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns
	about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements
	describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.


	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
	that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
	revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.



	 







	Item 3. Quantitative
	and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.



	 


	A smaller reporting company, as defined by
	Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.



	 







	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures




	 


	The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who
	is also the Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing
	and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
	designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is
	required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that
	evaluation, the CEO concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not
	effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules
	and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.   As a result of this evaluation, management identified the following deficiencies,
	which are deemed to be material weaknesses:


	 







	·




	Due
	to the size of the Company, there is a lack of segregation of duties, which would allow
	for proper processing, review and approval of transactions and events that have an impact
	on the Company’s financial results.










	·




	The
	Company lacks a system to allow for the review and monitoring of internal control over
	financial reporting, which would mitigate concerns related to management’s override
	of controls.










	·




	The
	Company lacks an independent Audit Committee, which can provide oversight of management
	and the financial reporting process.






	 





	Changes in Internal
	Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	There were no changes in our internal controls
	over financial reporting for the three months ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
	affect our internal control over financial reporting.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

	STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	 

	Except for the historical information contained herein, some of the statements in this Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements are found in the sections entitled "Business," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and "Risk Factors." They include statements concerning: our business strategy; expectations of market and customer response; liquidity and capital expenditures; future sources of revenues; expansion of our product lines; addition of new product lines; and trends in industry activity generally. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "could," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "goal," or "continue" or similar terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, the risks outlined under "Risk Factors," that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For example, assumptions that could cause actual results to vary materially from future results include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully develop and market our products to customers; our ability to generate customer demand for our products in our target markets; the development of our target markets and market opportunities; our ability to produce and deliver suitable products at competitive cost; market pricing for our products and for competing products; the extent of increasing competition; technological developments in our target markets and the development of alternate, competing technologies in them; and sales of shares by existing shareholders. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Unless we are required to do so under U.S. federal securities laws or other applicable laws, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

	. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results Of Operations.



	 


	The following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.


	 



	Plan of Operations




	 



	We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 28, 2014 and are a development stage company. Our company has developed a business plan for an online service www.caleminder.net that provides a calendar-based greeting and reminder service to assist subscribers in remembering important life events such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc.


	 


	Users will register with the system and enter these important dates as well as configure a variety of settings, including when they want to be notified, for example one month prior, two weeks prior, one week prior, etc. Currently we are developing the web based application.


	 


	We plan to monetize the site through several means, including advertisements; possibly local, national, global and corporate sponsors, and more. While the base service will be free to end-users, we believe that we may be able to earn additional revenue by developing an additional level of end user, who will subscribe to our for-pay services. These will include not only the reminder messages that are free, but the ability to configure automatic emails that will be sent on the day of the event – birthday, anniversary, etc. to another person. We believe we can create an interface that will enable the end-user to customize many factors within the notification. We may offer the for-pay users the opportunity to upload a video or tape an audio message that will be attached to the email or included in a link.


	 


	The Company will seek to generate revenue from third party advertising banners on its website.


	 


	However, management cannot provide any assurances that our company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 


	 



	Limited Operating History



	 


	We have generated no independent financial history and have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business. Our business is subject to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible rejection of our business model and/or sales methods.

	Results of Operations



	 



	For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015



	 



	Revenue



	 


	For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we did not generate any revenues.


	 



	Expenses



	 


	Expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $24,215 as compared to $46,857 in 2015. The majority of the expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of corporate filings, professional fees and consulting fees and the decrease in 2016 was mainly attributable to reduced costs incurred for consulting.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	As a result of the factors described above, our net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 was $24,215 as opposed to $46,857 in 2015.



	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	On December 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $4,299 which consisted of $4,299 in cash and cash equivalents and total current liabilities of $50,007 which consisted of $31,064 in loans from related party and $18,943 in accounts payable. On December 31, 2015, we had total current assets of $270 which consisted of $270 in cash and cash equivalents total current liabilities of $21,763 which consisted of $11,664 in loans from related party and $10,099 in accounts payable.


	 


	Historically, we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loans from related party. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $19,400 which was proceeds from related party loans. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $36,534, which consisted of proceeds from sale of common stock $50,000 less repayment of related party loans $13,466.


	 


	We have not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing, a successful development, marketing and promotion program and, further in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We will require additional funds to maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Delaware.

	Going Concern



	 


	Our company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern. Our company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company. There can be no assurance that our company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Our officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of our company, including legal, audit, transfer agency and edgarizing costs.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, our company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for our company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that our company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.


	 


	The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if our company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.


	 


	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.


	 



	Contractual Obligations



	 


	We do not have any contractual obligations at this time.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT

	REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Caleminder Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Caleminder Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholder’s deficit, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015. Caleminder Inc.’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	We were not engaged to examine management’s assertion about the effectiveness of Caleminder Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Caleminder Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses, has incurred negative cash flows from operations and has a working capital deficit. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 6 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	CALEMINDER INC.







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	December 31, 2016



	 




	NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS




	 


	Caleminder, Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on May 28, 2014. The Company has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations.


	 


	The Company’s principal operations plan includes an online reminder service. The Company plans to generate revenues through online advertising.


	 


	The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company’s business plan.


	 




	NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES


	 


	 




	Basis of Accounting




	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	When required, the Company records a liability for unrecognized tax positions, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability.


	 


	The Company recognizes penalties and interest associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in the balance sheet. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 




	 




	F-6







	 






	Table of Contents






	 




	Loss per Share




	 


	The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. The Company has not issued any potentially dilutive debt or equity securities.


	 




	Recently issued accounting pronouncements




	 


	The Company does not believe that there are any new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.


	 




	NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES




	 


	The Company uses the liability method , where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. As of December 31, 2016 the cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $90,458 and will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred.


	 




	NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT




	 




	Authorized




	 


	The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock. All common shares have equal voting rights, are non-assessable and have one vote per share. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they choose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company.


	 




	Issued and Outstanding




	 


	On June 1, 2014, the Company issued 7,500,000 common shares to its sole stockholder for cash consideration of $0.0001 per share. The proceeds of $750 were received on June 27, 2014.


	 


	On February 9, 2015, the Company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock for $50,000 as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC, at an offering price of $0.02 per share.


	 




	NOTE 5. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST




	 


	The officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.

	NOTE 6. GOING CONCERN




	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has no revenues, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $90,458 as of December 31, 2016. This condition among others raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	Management is planning to raise funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.


	 




	NOTE 7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS




	 


	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans from the Company’s sole stockholder amounted to $31,064 and $11,664, respectively, and represent working capital advances. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) (the Company’s principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (the Company’s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.



	 

	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Our internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 

	Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “ Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as of December 31, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective for the purposes for which it is intended.


	 

	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over our financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 the Company determined that the following items constituted a material weakness:


	 







	 




	The Company does not currently have an active Chief Financial Officer to oversee the day to day transactions and operations, which ensures the timely and accurate identification and reporting of all necessary transactions.






	 




	 






	 




	The Company does not have an independent audit committee that can review and approve significant transactions and the reporting process and provide independent oversight of the Company.






	 




	 






	 




	The Company is dependent on related parties for funding and decision making, which is provided on a very limited basis, therefore accurate accounting, record retention and financial disclosures are not performed in a timely and efficient manner.





	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm as we are a smaller reporting company and not required to provide the report.

	Item 10

	. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance



	 


	The following table sets forth the names and ages of officers and director as of December 31, 2016. Our executive officers are elected annually by our Board of Directors. Our executive officers hold their offices until they resign, are removed by the Board, or his successor is elected and qualified.

	Age








	Position







	 






	 





	 





	Shira Halperin




	 




	28




	 




	President, Director, Secretary, and Principal Accounting and Financial Officer






	 


	Our Director holds office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. According to our bylaws, if a director is elected by cumulative voting, a director may be removed only by the shareholders and then only when the votes cast against his removal would not be sufficient to elect him if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast and the entire board or the entire class of directors of which he is a member were then being elected.


	 


	Set forth below is a summary description of the principal occupation and business experience of each of our Directors and executive officers for at least the last five years.


	 


	Mrs. Halperin has served as our President, Secretary, Director and Internal accounting Officer since inception. From January 2007 thru 2010 Mrs. Halperin served as a part time consultant business adviser to the CEO of Tactile World Ltd., a technology development company, and a part time administrative assistant to a private real estate developer. From 2010 to present Mrs. Halperin volunteered at Ezer Mitzion, a nonprofit organization assisting for the sick and disabled. Mrs. Halperin other than the volunteer duties and the time devoted to the Caleminder is raising a family.


	 


	The Board believes that Mrs. Halperin should serve as a Director and Chief Executive Officer and Internal Accounting Officer due to her business and administrative experience, all of which enable her to provide oversight and direction of the Company, including overseeing its business operations and bringing the Company to its objective goals.

	Term of Office



	 


	Our directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board.


	 



	Director Independence and Board Committees



	 

	We do not have any independent directors on our board of directors. Our board of directors solely consists of Shira Halperin our Chief Executive Officer, and CFO. Our board of directors does not have any committees. However, if, at such time in the future, we appoint independent directors on our board we expect to form the appropriate board committees.


	 


	We currently do not have a standing audit, nominating or compensation committee. Our board of directors handles functions that would otherwise be handled by each of the committees. We believe that there is not a need for a nominating committee at this time because our board of directors consists of solely one director who is not independent and who is the only decision maker. At such point when we have independent board of directors we will need to establish a nomination committee.


	 



	Code of Ethics



	 


	We have not adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. We intend to adopt a Code of Ethics as we develop our business.


	 



	Compliance with Section 16(A) of the Exchange Act.



	 


	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are required to furnish copies to the Company. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, any reports required to be filed were timely filed in fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

	____________


	(1) Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. In accordance with SEC rules, Shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants which are currently exercisable or which become exercisable within 60 days following the date of the information in this table are deemed to be beneficially owned by, and outstanding with respect to, the holder of such option or warrant. Except as indicated by footnote, and subject to community property laws where applicable, to our knowledge, each person listed is believed to have sole voting and investment power with respect to all Shares of common stock owned by such person.

	Potential Change in Control



	 


	In February 2017, Shira Halperin, who holds of 75% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, and the representative of other shareholders holding an additional 24.95% shares of the Company’s common stock, entered into letters of intent with a third party to transfer 99.95% of our outstanding shares of common stock to such third party. Closing of the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent, which is anticipated to occur in April 2017, would result in a change of control of the Company.



	 






	Item 13

	. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.



	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company owed $31,064 to Director, officer, and principal stockholder of the Company for working capital loans.


	 


	On June 1, 2014, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares of its common stock to its sole Director and officer for $750.


	 



	Director Independence



	 


	We do not have any independent directors. Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of “independence” of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an “independent director” is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Company’s Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:


	 







	 




	the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company;






	 




	 






	 




	the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);






	 




	 






	 




	a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company;






	 




	 






	 




	the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);






	 




	 






	 




	the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or






	 




	 






	 




	the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company’s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the company’s outside auditor, and who worked on the company’s audit.





	 


	We do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee.

	In the above table, "audit fees" are fees billed by our Company's external auditor for services provided in auditing our Company's annual financial statements for the subject year. "Audit-related fees" are fees not included in audit fees that are billed by the auditor for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit review of our company's financial statements. "Tax fees" are fees billed by the auditor for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.


	 


	"All other fees" are fees billed by the auditor for products and services not included in the foregoing categories.


	 


	Pre Approval Policies and Procedures



	 


	We do not have a separately designated Audit Committee. The Board of Directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
