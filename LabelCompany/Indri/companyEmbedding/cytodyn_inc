PRO 140 belongs to a new class of HIV/AIDS therapeutics -- viral-entry inhibitors -- that are intended to protect healthy cells from viral infection.  PRO 140 is a fully humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against CCR5, a molecular portal that HIV uses to enter T-cells.  PRO 140 blocks the predominant HIV (R5) subtype entry into T-cells by masking this required co-receptor, CCR5.  Importantly PRO 140 does not appear to interfere with the normal function of CCR5 in mediating immune responses. 

PRO 140 has certain unique attributes that distinguish it from other therapies designed to block HIV entry.

PRO 140 is an antibody, not a synthetic drug and has no apparent issues with toxicity.
Laboratory studies have shown that PRO 140 does not induce the development of resistant viruses in previous short-term trials.
PRO 140 does not affect the normal function of CCR5, it only blocks the precise site on CCR5 that HIV needs to enter the cell without affecting the normal function of CCR5.

PRO 140 is one of the most advanced experimental monoclonal antibodies for HIV treatment and has been used in more than 140 HIV-infected subjects in placebo controlled and open label FDA-approved clinical trials. PRO 140 has been the subject of seven clinical trials, each demonstrating efficacy by significantly reducing or controlling HIV viral load in human test subjects.  PRO 140 has been designated a “fast track” product candidate by the FDA.  The PRO 140 antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent leading to potentially fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements as compared to daily drug therapies currently in use.
We believe that PRO 140 may have a number of potential roles in the treatment and prevention of HIV including:

Patients with single or multi-drug resistant viruses
Patients with difficulty adhering to daily drug regimens
Patients who poorly tolerate existing therapies
Patients with compromised organ function, i.e., HCV co-infection
Patients with complex concomitant medical requirements
Pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure (PEP) prophylactic in high risk seronegative individuals

HIV remains a significant global health issue. With limited new drugs in development around the world, CytoDyn believes that monoclonal antibodies are poised to become the next class of anti-viral agents on the market for the treatment of HIV.
CytoDyn is focused on developing monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of HIV infection and disease and is excited to continue the clinical trial development of PRO 140 for HIV.

					Full Description



CytoDyn Inc., incorporated on May 2, 2002, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is focused on the clinical development and commercialization of humanized monoclonal antibodies to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. The Company's lead product candidate, PRO 140, belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. The Company's product pipeline also includes Cytolin and CytoFeline. Cytolin is a mouse monoclonal antibody developed to identify a specific type of immune cell called a cytotoxic T cell, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). CytoFeline is an anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antibody for the treatment of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) infection.PRO 140 blocks HIV from entering a cell by binding to a molecule called C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), a normal cell surface co-receptor protein to which certain strains of HIV, referred to as R5 strains, attach as part of HIV's entry into a cell. PRO 140 has been tested and administered to test subjects either intravenously or as a subcutaneous injection. The Company has finished Phase II clinical trials for PRO 140 with demonstrated antiviral activity in man. It is also conducting an extension study of its Phase IIb treatment substitution trial for PRO 140. The Company is also conducting a pivotal Phase IIb/III trial for PRO 140 as a combination therapy to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) drug regimens. The Company is conducting a Phase II study for Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), which is designed to evaluate the feasibility of the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GvHD prophylaxis treatment for prevention of acute GvHD in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HST).The Company is conducting a Phase III trial, including approximately 300 patients to assess the treatment strategy of using PRO 140 subcutaneously as a long-acting single-agent maintenance therapy for over 48 weeks in patients with suppressed viral load with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. The Company has announced a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the safety and efficacy of PRO 140 in treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection. Cytolin binds to CD11a cellular antigen, and interrupts or prevents the function of one of these cellular acquired antigens as a therapeutic agent to treat HIV infection. In addition to CTLs, Cytolin also appears to bind another type of immune cell called dendritic cells (DCs). Cytolin is in the pre-clinical trials. FIV has a primary tropism for lymphocytes and gradually destroys sub-populations of T lymphocytes.The Company competes with Pfizer.
