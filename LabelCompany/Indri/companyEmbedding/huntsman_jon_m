History[edit]
The Huntsman Corporation was initially founded as the Huntsman Container Corporation in 1970 by Jon Huntsman, Sr. It went public as the Huntsman Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: HUN in February 2005. Huntsman has grown through a series of acquisitions (with some divestitures) and today is a manufacturer and marketer of differentiated chemical products.
In April 1994, Huntsman acquired the Texaco Chemical company for $1.06 billion.[3] Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its last remaining petrochemicals plant to Huntsman in 1999 for about $600 million.[4]
The Huntsman Corporation became the then third-largest petrochemical business in the United States when in 1999, it acquired Imperial Chemical Industries' polyurethanes, titanium dioxide, aromatics and petrochemical global businesses for $2.8 billion.[5]
Huntsman also acquired the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. on October 1, 2014, to become the second-largest global producer of titanium dioxide and inorganic color pigments for uses like paints and industrial coatings.[6] Huntsman paid approximately $1 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded European pension liabilities.[7]
Terminated takeover by Access Industries[edit]
In June 2007, it was announced that Huntsman had agreed to be acquired by Access Industries, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, for $5.88 billion in cash. Huntsman shareholders would receive $25.25 a share from Access Industries' chemical unit, Basell Holdings, based in Hoofddorp, Netherlands. Access would assume $3.7 billion of Huntsman debt.
However, on July 12, 2007, the agreement was terminated as Huntsman agreed to be bought by Apollo Management for $6.51 billion or $28 a share.[8] Huntsman filed a suit against Apollo Management and its two partners in Texas after the group backed out of the deal to purchase the chemical company. The suit alleged fraud against Apollo Management as Huntsman believed that the group never intended to allow its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit to buy Huntsman Corp. for $6.5 billion. Huntsman also claimed Apollo put forth a higher bid to prevent the Basell AF buyout as it would have threatened Hexion's market share. Hexion stated Huntsman's declining financial position as the reason the deal was terminated.[9] Upon termination of the Hexion merger agreement, the Huntsman stock value dropped by almost 50%.
In December 2008, Apollo and Hexion agreed to pay Huntsman $1 billion in return for Huntsman dropping all charges against them. A suit against the funding banks was settled in 2009 for $632 million in cash and $1.1 billion in loans to the Huntsman Corporation.[10]
Merger of equals: HuntsmanClariant[edit]
In May 2017, Huntsman and Clariant announced that they would merge, as equals, forming HuntsmanClariant which would be the global leader in speciality chemical production - with the deal valued at $20 billion.[11][12] Clariant shareholders will own 52% of the new entity, with Huntsman shareholders owning the remaining 48% of shares.[13][14]
Business segments[edit]
Advanced Materials is a supplier of synthetic and formulated polymer systems. Huntsman’s epoxy, acrylic and polyurethane-based polymer products are used to replace traditional materials in aircraft, automobiles and electrical power transmission.
Polyurethanes manufactures MDI-based polyurethane solutions used in an extensive range of applications and market sectors. Polyurethanes provide key benefits of energy efficiency, comfort, and well-being. Insulation products conserve energy in housing and commercial properties and play a critical role in the food supply chain – keeping products at the right temperature in refrigerated vehicles, chiller cabinets, and refrigerators. Polyurethanes also provide comfort and well-being in automotive seating, furniture, bedding, and footwear. Adhesive products, coatings, and elastomers are used extensively throughout consumer and industrial applications.
Performance Products manufactures products primarily based on amines, carbonates, surfactants and maleic anhydride. End uses include agrochemicals, oil and gas and alternative energy solutions, home detergents and personal care products, adhesives and coatings, mining, and polyurethane/epoxy curing agents.
Pigments and Additives is a manufacturer of titanium dioxide pigments and additives used to add performance and color to items such as paints, inks, plastics and concrete to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food.
Textile Effects manufactures and markets textile dyes and chemicals that enhance color and improve performance such as fade resistance, UV-blocking and the ability to repel water and stains in apparel, home, and technical textiles.

About us

































About us

We serve a broad and diverse range of consumer and industrial end markets, including: transportation, home life, construction, energy and fuels, and clothing and footwear. We develop products that address customers’ needs and help provide solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges. Through our five divisions, we operate in more than 30 countries around the world, employing over 15,000 associates. 
Message from the Founder and Chairman
More than four decades ago, in 1970, we founded Huntsman Container Corporation.  We had no idea then that our fledgling packaging business would evolve into what has become one of the world's largest chemical companies.  Through a series of strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and carefully planned internal expansions, our operating companies today produce 33 billion pounds of products for a variety of global businesses, including chemicals, plastics, automotive, aviation, footwear, paints and coatings, construction, technology, agriculture, health care, textiles, detergent, personal care, furniture, appliances and packaging.  
Our success is due, in large measure, to the thousands of associates who work in our facilities around the world to manufacture the chemical industry's highest quality products.
We have been most fortunate to build a company of this magnitude, and it is our duty and privilege to give back to society.  Through our humanitarian initiatives, we have helped to provide food and housing to the hungry and homeless around the world; we have funded education for those who otherwise would not have been able to attend school.  
Most importantly, our dream of establishing a world class cancer research and treatment center has been realized.   The Huntsman Cancer Institute and Hospitals represents our purpose in life, and our ultimate goal will have been achieved when the most challenging forms of cancer have been eradicated.  Our family will continue to serve as the principal benefactors and fundraisers for the Huntsman Cancer Institute in the quest to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure cancer.   
Jon M. Huntsman

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

Early life and education[edit]
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman, was an educator.[4] In 1950 the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos, California district.
Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship.[5] He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[6]
Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959. Both are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church. In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as a U.S. Naval Gunnery Officer. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
Business career[edit]
Dolco Packaging Corporation[edit]
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles.[7] There he rose through the ranks to the position of Vice President of Operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965 he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967 he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.[2]
Huntsman Container Corporation[edit]
Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Blaine, and others in Fullerton, California.[7][8] Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972.[8] Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make styrofoam.[9]
In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the "clamshell" container for McDonald's Big Mac.[7] The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls and fast-food containers.[5][8] In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.[8]
Huntsman Chemical Company - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN)[edit]
In 1982, after serving as an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) Mission President in Washington, DC for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Corporation, in Salt Lake City, Utah.[10] In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.[9]
In 1994 the Huntsman Chemical Corporation was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company’s CEO.[11] Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.[12]
During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.[13] As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.[14]
Huntsman Gay Global Capital[edit]
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional, new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, joining former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) to focus on investments in middle market companies.[15][16] Among Huntsman's partners is Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.[15]
Scientific awards and honors[edit]
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities.[17] In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy.[18][19] In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&E) group.[20] In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Huntsman has been married to his wife, Karen, for more than 50 years. They are the parents of 9 children and have 56 grandchildren, two of whom are adopted from China and India.[citation needed]
On December 8, 1987, Huntsman's son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest. [22][23][24]
Huntsman's second eldest son, Peter R. Huntsman, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation from Huntsman Sr. in 2000.[11]
Huntsman's eldest son, Jon Huntsman Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected governor of Utah in 2004, later became ambassador to China, and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012.[25]
Jon Huntsman Sr. has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten), it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times, made the Wall Street Journal's best-sellers list.[26]
Huntsman is a four-time cancer survivor.[27]
Religion[edit]
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church. He served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president and as president of the Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.
Politics[edit]
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders.[28] He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980.[28] He is a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show.[29] He is more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr.[citation needed] His focus is cancer thus he is close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who have both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Nixon administration[edit]
While the Huntsman Container Corporation's first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon.[28] Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving - in a non-paid position - as a consultant to the Office of the President.
Presidential elections[edit]
He served as Chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush's campaigns in 1988 and 1992.[28]
1988 Utah gubernatorial election[edit]
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin.[30] He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter's campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter.[31][32] Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.[17]
2012 Republican presidential nomination[edit]
Huntsman's son, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.[25]
There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.'s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac "Our Destiny PAC".[33] Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012, telling NPR that "the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn't consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause".[34] However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr.[35][36] Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.[37]
Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire.[38] Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina[38] but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.[39]
Philanthropy[edit]
Huntsman is widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally.[40] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors.[41] On January 1, 2000, The Salt Lake Tribune included him among "The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century" for his donations to education and medical research.[42] In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership.[43] In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy,[44] and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[45] In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable’s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.[46]
Cancer research[edit]




The Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah


One of Huntsman's most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he is the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year's total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society.[47] Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America's major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.[5][26]
The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, who himself is a cancer survivor, has stated "Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease."[48] To date, the huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.
In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children's cancer.[49] Construction of the Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute is nearing completion and will be dedicated June 21, 2017, on Huntsman's 80th birthday.
Huntsman has also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research.[50][51] By 2017, Sigma Chi's total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.
Education[edit]




Jon M. Huntsman Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City






Jon M. Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Huntsman has supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball.[52] It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics[53] and basketball, including NCAA men's basketball.[54] As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.[55]
Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.[56] One of the school's signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project.[57] As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.[58]
In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman's father.[59] In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university's history to that time.[60] In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.[61]
The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors.[62] A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room.[63] The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a "green" building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.[64][65]

Aid to Armenia[edit]
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years.[66] He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals.[67] One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians.[66] The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan,[68] apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri.[66][69] The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to American to study at Utah State University.[66][70] Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order,[66][68]
Huntsman's donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the "Forbes 400" list as of 2010. His current wealth is not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the "Forbes World's Richest Persons" for 2010.[71] He is one of only 19 of the world's 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion.[40] He has said that he wants to "die broke" by giving his money away to various charities.[72]
Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

I was impressed with Jon from the first, when he told me he lost respect for Richard Nixon... when he learned that Nixon had not given anything to charity one year he was president ... It was clear to me that Jon's real motivation in his work and accumulation of wealth was to give much of what he has to make people's lives better.[73]

Controversy[edit]
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Dr. Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold 250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee's character in the public sphere.[76][77] Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.
In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a "power-grab", while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties.[78] This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare. [79]

About us

































About us

We serve a broad and diverse range of consumer and industrial end markets, including: transportation, home life, construction, energy and fuels, and clothing and footwear. We develop products that address customers’ needs and help provide solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges. Through our five divisions, we operate in more than 30 countries around the world, employing over 15,000 associates. 
Message from the Founder and Chairman
More than four decades ago, in 1970, we founded Huntsman Container Corporation.  We had no idea then that our fledgling packaging business would evolve into what has become one of the world's largest chemical companies.  Through a series of strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and carefully planned internal expansions, our operating companies today produce 33 billion pounds of products for a variety of global businesses, including chemicals, plastics, automotive, aviation, footwear, paints and coatings, construction, technology, agriculture, health care, textiles, detergent, personal care, furniture, appliances and packaging.  
Our success is due, in large measure, to the thousands of associates who work in our facilities around the world to manufacture the chemical industry's highest quality products.
We have been most fortunate to build a company of this magnitude, and it is our duty and privilege to give back to society.  Through our humanitarian initiatives, we have helped to provide food and housing to the hungry and homeless around the world; we have funded education for those who otherwise would not have been able to attend school.  
Most importantly, our dream of establishing a world class cancer research and treatment center has been realized.   The Huntsman Cancer Institute and Hospitals represents our purpose in life, and our ultimate goal will have been achieved when the most challenging forms of cancer have been eradicated.  Our family will continue to serve as the principal benefactors and fundraisers for the Huntsman Cancer Institute in the quest to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure cancer.   
Jon M. Huntsman

 Product Description 

The inspirational autobiography of the billionaire businessman determined to cure cancer and give away his entire fortuneBillionaire entrepreneur, distinguished public servant, and father of a former governor and presidential candidate, Jon M. Huntsman, Sr. has been very fortunate in life. The company he founded in 1970, the Huntsman Corporation, is now one of the largest petrochemical manufacturers in the world, employing more than 12,000 people and generating over $10 billion in revenue each year. Success in business, though, has always been a means to an end — never an end in itself. In Barefoot to Billionaire, Huntsman revisits the key moments in his life that shaped his view of faith, family, service, and the responsibility that comes with wealth. He writes candidly about his brief tenure in the Nixon administration, which preceded the Watergate scandal but still left a deep impression on him about the abuse of power and the significance of personal respect and integrity. He also opens up about his faith and prominent membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. But most importantly, Huntsman reveals the rationale behind his commitment to give away his entire fortune before his death. In 1995, Huntsman and his wife Karen founded the Huntsman Cancer Institute and have since dedicated more than a billion dollars of their personal funds to the fight for a cure. They don’t plan to stop giving until the battle is won. In this increasingly materialistic world, Barefoot to Billionaire is a refreshing reminder of the enduring power of traditional values.
