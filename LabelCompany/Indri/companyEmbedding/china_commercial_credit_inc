Discover How to Buy a Business with Little to None of Your Own Money! 


Learn how you can get 100% funding to buy a business. Not like real estate investing or stock trading, but the business of your dreams — like a coffee shop, hair salon, spa,  retail store, auto shop, liquor store, restaurant, sports bar, etc.






 



93% of small business funding is rejected by banks. Banks overwhelmingly say “No” to small business loan requests. However, just because a bank won’t fund a deal doesn’t mean there is no startup business funding or business credit available for that deal. Since 2003, Ed Keels and his staff at Beyond Breakeven, Inc. (BBI) have been helping people with deal structures that provide business funding and business credit when banks won’t. In fact, BBI has developed more than 100 ways to fund a business acquisition or startup and do so with little to none of the buyer’s own money.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

AMID's Chinese Company Report (CCR) provides information on the Chinese large public-traded corporations, large manufacturing producers, large financial companies or large service providers. In the two past decades, the Chinese industry has been growing at a fast pace.   The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China’s society and economy. China is one of the world’s major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world’s fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.  The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market. 
Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector’s economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products. This new study focuses on the company's business overiew, organzation structure, products and services, production locations, recent activities, and financail data 
Asia Market Info & Dev Co. is one of the leading sources for up-to-date market information and research on the fastest-growing Chinese markets. We have published over 2,000 reports focusing on the Chinese markets,  industry forecasts and company profiles. We provide hard-to-find market data and analyses. Our publications are intended to help international marketers identify business opportunities and promote their product sales in the Chinese markets.

Discover How to Buy a Business with Little to None of Your Own Money! 


Learn how you can get 100% funding to buy a business. Not like real estate investing or stock trading, but the business of your dreams — like a coffee shop, hair salon, spa,  retail store, auto shop, liquor store, restaurant, sports bar, etc.






 



93% of small business funding is rejected by banks. Banks overwhelmingly say “No” to small business loan requests. However, just because a bank won’t fund a deal doesn’t mean there is no startup business funding or business credit available for that deal. Since 2003, Ed Keels and his staff at Beyond Breakeven, Inc. (BBI) have been helping people with deal structures that provide business funding and business credit when banks won’t. In fact, BBI has developed more than 100 ways to fund a business acquisition or startup and do so with little to none of the buyer’s own money.
