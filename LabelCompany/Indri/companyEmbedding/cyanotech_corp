        BioAstin Production and Purity

Cyanotech  Corporation has been commercially producing microalgal products for over  21 years. During this time we have developed advanced technology which,  combined with our location on the pristine Kona Coast of the Big Island  of Hawaii, allows us to produce unialgal, contamination-free products.
Our most advanced technology is used for the production of BioAstin Natural Astaxanthin products from Haematococcus microalgae. The initial production of Haematococcus takes  place in closed culture systems, some as large as 40,000 liters. This  is followed by a short, 5 to 7 day, "reddening" cycle conducted in  500,000 liter open culture ponds. At each stage of BioAstin production, Haematococcus cultures are closely monitored by microscopic examination to ensure the  cultures are pure and free from contaminating organisms. After the  reddening cycle, Haematococcus cultures are harvested, washed and dried. The final step for the production of BioAstin is extraction of dried Haematococcus biomass using supercritical carbon dioxide to produce a purified  oleoresin, absolutely free of any biological or environmental  contamination. This supercritical extraction process is a critical step  ensuring the proper potency, purity and quality of BioAstin Natural Astaxanthin.
There is a  general misconception that closed culture production of microalgal  products eliminates contamination from unwanted organisms. This is not  true. Closed culture systems can and are contaminated by unwanted algae,  fungi, and protozoa. When this does occur, elimination of the  biological contamination in closed culture systems can be very difficult  because of the high surface area and many "nooks and crannies" in such  systems. Indeed, persistent contamination of closed culture systems has  led to serious problems for microalgae companies in California, Hawaii  (not Cyanotech), and Europe. Cyanotech's closed culture systems, as well  as its open pond systems, have been designed based on many years of  experience to minimize problems and to ensure production of  contamination-free microalgal products.
Cyanotech's natural Astaxanthin production  holds a Food Establishment Permit from the State of Hawaii  Department of Health for manufacturing and processing. We are also c-GMP  and operate under US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines.  Each lot of BioAstin Natural Astaxanthin goes through rigorous quality control to ensure the highest quality and  purity. In addition to unsurpassed quality and purity, our many years  of experience and proprietary technology allow us to produce far greater  quantities of Natural Astaxanthin than our competitors, and we maintain a market share at over 95% of the animal nutrition market for algae-based Astaxanthin products.

Spirulina is a microscopic blue-green vegetable algae that has been used as a significant food source for centuries.




Spirulina Pacifica® is a select strain of Spirulina platensis developed over many years of continuous cultivation in Hawaii. Strain  development and perfection started in 1984. Our cultures in Hawaii  represent the oldest continuously cultivated and harvested Spirulina in  the world. Hawaii's year-round growing conditions and our integrated  culture management system have made this possible. Spirulina Pacifica  has been extensively analyzed by molecular biologists at the University  of Hawaii who identified unique enzymes not previously found in other  strains of Spirulina platensis.




Spirulina Pacifica is a highly absorbable source of  protein, mixed carotenoids and other phytonutrients, B-Vitamins, GLA and  essential amino acids.

            All Cyanotech products are pesticide and herbicide free, and do not contain any genetically modified organisms (GMOs).










How is Hawaiian Spirulina Produced?
Spirulina Pacifica is a specially bred strain of the edible microalgae Spirulina platensis.  It is cultured in shallow, open ponds (approximately 20 cm deep)  adjacent to the Pacific Ocean. A combination of fresh water and  supplemental deep ocean water is used to fill the ponds. The other major  components required for growing Spirulina Pacifica are food-grade  baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and carbon dioxide. Food grade  fertilizers are used and the deep sea water is added as a rich source of  minerals and trace elements. Paddle wheels agitate the water, ensuring  even exposure of the algae to the sun for optimal growth and nutritional  value.

The company's operating loss improved slightly, decreasing to $682,000 from $785,000 last year.




“While we suffered from high legal costs this year, our results reflect positive momentum in the areas where we are focused strategically," Gerry Cysewski, president and CEO of Cyanotech, said in a statement. "Additionally, we instituted production efficiencies and a restructuring that should generate cost savings in the next fiscal year."
For the fourth quarter, ending March 31, Cyanotech (Nasdaq: CYAN) reported a net loss of $274,000, or half-a-cent per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2016.
The Big Island company also reported net sales of $7.3 million, compared to $8.2 million during the same time period last year. Its gross profit decreased to $2.66 million from $2.76 million in 2016.
