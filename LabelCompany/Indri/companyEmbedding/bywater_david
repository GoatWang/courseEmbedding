New COO David Bywater Adds to Vivint’s Growing Executive Team
Vivint™ the largest home automation services copmany in North America, today announced the appointment of David Bywater as the company’s new chief operating officer. In this position, Bywater is responsible for the daily operations of the company, including customer operations, human resources, field service, and supply chain.  For the past 20 years Bywater has consulted with and run some of the most innovative and dynamic companies in the world and brings a strong track record of rapidly expanding small, medium, and large enterprises.

“We are excited to welcome David to our team,” said Vivint’s president, Alex Dunn. “He has been extremely successful taking organizations to the next level. And because innovation and growth are trademarks of Vivint’s culture, we felt his expertise and skillset were the perfect fit for our company as we continue to expand.”

Before joining Vivint, Bywater spent 10 years working at Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), one of the largest BPO and ITO companies in the world.  During his tenure with ACS, he ran many of ACS business units, which encapsulated more than 60 different companies ranging from $10 million to over $400 million in annual revenue. ACS grew from $3 billion in annual revenue to more than $8 billion and was acquired by Xerox in 2009.

Most recently, Bywater served as an Executive Vice President and Corporate Officer for Xerox and was the Chief Operating Officer of its $1.8 billion State Government Services Business which. This division experienced significant growth and transformation under his leadership. Bywater holds a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Brigham Young University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

“This is a dynamic technology company with ambitious goals and a fantastic track record,” says Bywater. “I’m excited to be a part of this exceptional executive team and to contribute to Vivint’s continued success.”

Bywater is just latest in a string of new talent acquisitions with impressive educational backgrounds, hands-on experience building and growing businesses, and in-depth technical expertise. 

“Our executive team is one of the reasons Vivint is a success,” says CEO Todd Pedersen. “During the 13 years we’ve been in business, Vivint has become one of the fastest growing companies in our industry. I have high expectations that with the talent and drive we’re bringing to the team, the goals we’ve already achieved are just the beginning.”

Todd Thompson, Vivint’s new chief information officer (CIO), was hired in July and is responsible for companywide information technology (IT) functions. Thompson has more than 20 years of IT leadership experience with technology companies like Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and JetBlue Airways.

Todd Santiago also recently joined the company as chief sales officer to lead all sales efforts at Vivint. Before Vivint, Santiago served as president of 2Gig Technologies. He holds an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Finally, in January of 2013, Matthew Eyring became Vivint’s chief strategy and innovation officer. In this position, Eyring leads Vivint’s directional growth initiatives in the home automation, residential security, and solar markets. Before joining Vivint, Eyring was a managing partner at Innosight, a global strategy and innovation firm, and vice president and general manager at LavaStorm. Eyring also received an MBA from Harvard Business School.

David Bywater Child Labour




















Spartacus Educational






















David Bywater

David Bywater was born in Leeds in 1815. Bywater was interviewed by Michael Sadler and his House of Commons Committee on 13th April, 1832. He explained how long he had to work: "We started at one o'clock on Monday morning, and then we went on again till eight o'clock, at breakfast time; then we had half an hour; and then we went on till twelve o'clock, and had half an hour for drinking; and then we stopped at half past eleven for refreshment for an hour and a half at midnight; and then we went on again till breakfast time, when we had half an hour; and then we went on again till twelve o'clock, at dinner time, and then we had an hour: and then we stopped at five o'clock again on Tuesday afternoon for half an hour for drinking; then we went on till past eleven, and then we gave over till five o'clock on Wednesday morning." Bywater claimed that this led to physical deformities: "It made me very crooked in my knees."








Primary Sources


(1) David Bywater was interviewed by Michael Sadler and his House of Commons Committee on 13th April, 1832.

Question: At what age were you when you entered upon night work in the steaming department?
Answer: I was nearly fourteen.
Question: Will you state to this committee the labour which you endured when you were put upon long hours.
Answer: We started at one o'clock on Monday morning, and then we went on again till eight o'clock, at breakfast time; then we had half an hour; and then we went on till twelve o'clock, and had half an hour for drinking; and then we stopped at half past eleven for refreshment for an hour and a half at midnight; and then we went on again till breakfast time, when we had half an hour; and then we went on again till twelve o'clock, at dinner time, and then we had an hour: and then we stopped at five o'clock again on Tuesday afternoon for half an hour for drinking; then we went on till past eleven, and then we gave over till five o'clock on Wednesday morning.
Question: Did you go home then?
Answer: No, we slept in the mill.
Question: How did you sleep in the mill?
Answer: We took all our clothes off, except our shirts, and got into the warmest part of the mill, and amongst the driest cloth we could.
Question: Did you take your meals standing?
Answer: Yes, we put our baskets on the boxes.
Question: Were you perfect in your limbs when you undertook that long and excessive labour?
Answer: Yes.
Question: What effect did it have on your limbs?
Answer: It made me very crooked in my knees.
Question: If you refused to work long hours, and wished to have worked a moderate length of time only, should you have been retained in your situation?
Answer: I should have had to go home. I should have been turned off directly.
Question: Have you received any information as to what will be the consequences of your having given evidence.
Answer: My overlooker told my brother that if I came to London I should never have any employment any more, nor my brother neither. My brother said he could not help it; but I expect that the first time he does a job which does not please that he will turn him away; because, if you work in a family, and one does wrong, the whole family must go.

Domino sets the bar high at interpack 2014





Interpack 2014 will see Domino, the global product and traceability specialist, present the latest addition to its laser portfolio, as well as new entries in its V-Series thermal transfer overprinter (TTO) and A-Series continuous inkjet printer (CIJ) ranges, all of which include i-Tech intelligent Technology smart features.
Making its debut is the F220i, a system incorporating a powerful fibre laser with beam properties which can be altered for sharper colour contrast and extending precision marking into a wider range of substrates, including metal and plastics. Capable of static and ‘on the fly’ processing, it can mark unlimited lines in any orientation and a wide variety of font sizes, for use in both low and high production line speeds. A significant processing advantage is that the fibre has a very long life of up to 100,000 hours without requiring planned maintenance.
New additions to the popular V-Series TTO and A-Series CIJ ranges include the V230i and A520i, which offer enhanced performance capabilities to manufacturers, such as increased throughput times and faster processing speeds for streamlined operations.
The stackable A520i features a stainless steel outer casing making it suitable for the harsh production environments often encountered in the food, beverage and dairy sectors.
Industrial yet ergonomic, the V230i is suitable for most applications and very easy to use. Simple and functional design guarantees the quickest ribbon changeovers keeping downtime to a minimum. V230i can also be retro-fitted into existing TTO brackets, making it easy to swap out old equipment to achieve the highest print capability at the lowest running costs.
An extensive range of products and technology will also be shown on the Domino stand, including the latest systems from the G-Series, D-Series and M-Series ranges, amongst others, which provide high quality solutions for manufacturers in a range of sectors, including food and pharmaceutical.
With the European Union, the USA, China and Brazil all passing legislation to address the issue of pharmaceutical counterfeiting, Domino will also showcase products capable of item-level serialisation – a common requirement of all global legislation. The G-Series TIJ printer range and D-Series lasers are perfect for high-speed serialisation, and the M-Series print and apply labelling machines meet aggregation needs. Domino’s industry leading inks will also be demonstrated, highlighting the importance of pack code legibility, a key requirement for all medicines throughout their lifespan.
David Bywater, Product Director Domino comments, “We’re delighted to be unveiling our new laser capability at this year’s interpack. Manufacturers will benefit from its ability to provide very precise coding and marking across the widest possible range of substrates.”
“The latest additions to our extremely popular V and A Series offer increased operational simplicity while extending their use into a greater number of applications, through updates and additional features. Showcasing these systems allows us to demonstrate how our extensive range of coding and marking technologies are able to meet the increasing demands of the packaging industry.”

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.
