Time Warner Cable and Advance/Newhouse Announce New Cable Partnership Structure | Time Warner Inc.





























Jump to navigation






















Time Warner Cable and Advance/Newhouse Announce New Cable Partnership Structure




June 24, 2002
NEW YORK and STAMFORD, CT, June 24, 2002  Time Warner Cable, a division of AOL Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: AOL), and Advance/Newhouse Communications today announced a new structure for their cable partnership. 
This new structure will enable Advance/Newhouse to take a more active management role in the day-to-day operations of certain cable partnership systems. Serving approximately 2.1 million cable customers, the systems that Advance/Newhouse will manage are located in Central Florida; Tampa Bay, FL; Birmingham, AL; Indianapolis, IN; Bakersfield, CA and Detroit, MI; and will include several smaller systems in Alabama and northern Florida.  
As a result of this restructuring, Advance/Newhouse's economic interest in the cable partnership will track only those systems that it will manage rather than one-third of all cable partnership systems. The economic stakes of AOL Time Warner and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (TWE)  a separate partnership between AOL Time Warner and AT&T  will track the cable partnership's other systems. When the transaction is complete, Time Warner Cable will continue to fully manage cable systems serving a total of 10.8 million cable subscribers.  
Time Warner Cable will continue to provide certain management functions, including programming, for all of the cable partnership's systems. In addition, all of the cable partnership's systems, including those to be managed by Advance/Newhouse, will continue to support multiple ISPs  including AOL High Speed Broadband, Road Runner and EarthLink services  and will roll out other new service technologies like video-on-demand (VOD), subscription VOD, digital video recording and home networking. In the future, the partners will explore ways to work together to provide technological and new product development services jointly for all of the cable partnership's systems.  
"We are pleased that this agreement will keep Advance/Newhouse and its cable subscribers in the family," said Glenn Britt, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner Cable. "Together, we will ensure that our customers enjoy a seamless transition, while we continue to benefit operationally from the existing advantages of scale." 
"We are pleased to be assuming oversight of the day-to-day management of these fine cable systems. With their strong management teams and dedicated employees, we look forward to providing our customers a great video and data experience and a very high level of customer service and support," said Robert Miron, CEO of Advance/Newhouse. "At the same time, our customers will benefit from the continued cable partnership with Time Warner Cable through the rollout of multiple ISPs, video-on-demand and other advanced services." 
All local management decisions at the Advance/Newhouse-managed systems will continue to be made at the local level, just as they have been under the Time Warner Cable structure. No layoffs or job eliminations are planned by virtue of this restructuring. 
Advance/Newhouse is expected to assume management responsibility for these systems later this year. After that time, the assets and liabilities and the results of operations  including revenues, EBITDA and operating income  of the cable systems managed by Advance/Newhouse will no longer be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of AOL Time Warner or TWE. This transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the operating metrics, such as subscriber penetration and average revenue per subscriber, of the cable systems fully managed by Time Warner Cable.  
For the first quarter of 2002, the impact of deconsolidating the cable systems which Advance/Newhouse will manage would have reduced the revenues and EBITDA of AOL Time Warner's Cable segment by approximately $350 million and $160 million, respectively. For the full-year 2001, the impact of deconsolidating the Advance/Newhouse-managed systems would have reduced the revenues and EBITDA of AOL Time Warner's Cable segment by approximately $1.250 billion and $570 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2002, AOL Time Warner's net debt would have been reduced by approximately $800 million as a result of this transaction. 
As part of this new cable partnership structure, Time Warner Cable will acquire Advance/Newhouse's interest in Road Runner, the world's largest high-speed cable modem Internet service, and consolidate Road Runner's assets, liabilities and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements of AOL Time Warner and TWE. After considering the elimination of intercompany transactions between AOL Time Warner's Cable segment and Road Runner, for the first quarter of 2002, the impact of consolidating Road Runner would have increased revenues and decreased EBITDA for AOL Time Warner's Cable segment by approximately $25 million and $30 million, respectively. For the full-year 2001, the impact of consolidating Road Runner would have increased revenues and decreased EBITDA for AOL Time Warner's Cable segment by approximately $90 million and $170 million, respectively.  
Formed in 1995, the objective of the original cable partnership between Time Warner Cable  through TWE  and Advance/Newhouse was to pool their resources to create stronger cable clusters. Time Warner Cable and Advance/Newhouse contributed approximately 3 million and 1.5 million subscribers, respectively, to the original cable partnership. Through this cable partnership, the two operators were able to build more economically valuable clusters in cities and put themselves in a better position to trade with other cable operators to create new cable clusters.  
The cable partnership of Time Warner Cable and Advance/Newhouse currently serves approximately 7 million subscribers, including those systems to be managed by Advance/Newhouse, and major clusters in upstate New York and the Carolinas, as well as 1.2 million subscribers served by Texas Cable Partners, a 50%-owned partnership, whose financial results are not consolidated with those of AOL Time Warner.  
The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. 
About Time Warner CableTime Warner Cable owns and manages the world's most advanced, best-clustered cable television operations, with 92 percent of its customers in systems of 100,000 subscribers or more. It is a division of AOL Time Warner Inc.  
About Advance/Newhouse CommunicationsAdvance/Newhouse is a privately held company headquartered in Syracuse, New York. In addition to its interest in the TWE-A/N cable partnership, Advance/Newhouse holds interests in Discovery Communications, Inc. and Time Warner Telecom, Inc. Robert Miron, the CEO of Advance/Newhouse, has held various positions with Advance/Newhouse for over 30 years and, in addition to other industry positions, has twice served as Chairman of the National Cable Television Association.  
Advance/Newhouse is owned by the Newhouse family. In addition to its cable television and programming interests, the Newhouse family's businesses include Condé Nast magazines, PARADE magazine, Golf Digest Companies, Fairchild Publications, daily newspapers serving 26 cities (including Birmingham), American City Business Journals, which publishes business journals in over 45 cities (including Tampa, Orlando and Birmingham), and Advance Internet and CondéNet, producers of online services.

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Advance Newhouse Partnership carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Advance Newhouse Partnership currently holds license EF20000992, EF20001097 (Certified Alarm System Contractor I, Additional Business Qualification), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Advance Newhouse Partnership



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Advance Newhouse Partnership



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Advance Newhouse Partnership



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

      On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the September 29, 2015
judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not
persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.

       MARKMAN, J. (dissenting).

        I respectfully dissent from this Court’s order denying leave to appeal. Because the
issues raised here are, in my judgment, of considerable constitutional significance as to
matters affecting the tax policy and procedures, the fiscal and business environments, and
the jurisprudence of this state, I believe they ought to be heard by the highest court of this
state, and would thus grant leave to appeal.

        In 1970, Michigan joined the Multistate Tax Compact (the Compact) when the
Legislature enacted MCL 205.581. See 1969 PA 243, effective July 1, 1970. Article
III(1) of the Compact provided that certain multistate taxpayers may elect to apportion
income to Michigan for tax purposes “in the manner provided by the laws of such state,”
i.e., the laws of Michigan, or else “in accordance with Article IV.” MCL 205.581, art
III(1). Article IV provided for an apportionment formula based on property, payroll, and
sales factors. MCL 205.581, art IV(9). Effective January 1, 2008, the Legislature
enacted the Michigan Business Tax Act (BTA), MCL 208.1101 et seq., 2007 PA 36,
which provided that “each tax base established under this act shall be apportioned in
accordance with this chapter.” MCL 208.1301(1). Finally, MCL 208.1301(2) of the
BTA provided for an apportionment formula based solely on a sales factor.

        At issue in IBM v Dep’t of Treasury, 496 Mich. 642 (2014), was whether the
plaintiff multistate taxpayer could elect to use the Compact’s three-factor apportionment
formula for its 2008 Michigan taxes or whether, as the defendant Department of Treasury
argued, it was required to use the BTA’s sales-factor-only apportionment formula. This
Court ruled in IBM that the taxpayer could elect to use the Compact’s apportionment
formula. The lead opinion stated that “the Legislature had [not] repealed the Compact’s
election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA,” id. at 645 (opinion by
VIVIANO, J.), while the concurring opinion left that question open, id. at 668 (ZAHRA, J.,
concurring). In response, the Legislature enacted 2014 PA 282, which repealed the
Compact “retroactively and effective beginning January 1, 2008.” 2014 PA 282,
enacting § 1. As a consequence, 2014 PA 282 retroactively repealed the Compact
election provision beginning that date as well. Several multistate taxpayers challenged
the constitutionality of 2014 PA 282, but the Court of Claims and the Court of Appeals
                                                                                          5

upheld the statute against those challenges. Gillette Commercial Operations North
America & Subsidiaries v Dep’t of Treasury, 312 Mich. App. 394, 401 (2015). In my
judgment, the following four constitutional questions that are raised in the taxpayers’
various applications for leave to appeal warrant thorough consideration by this Court by a
grant of leave to appeal:

        First, is 2014 PA 282 consistent with federal due-process protections, US Const,
Ams V and XIV, given that the retroactivity period here of six years and nine months
arguably exceeds “a modest period of retroactivity,” United States v Carlton, 512 U.S. 26,
32 (1994), and that one justice has observed in this same regard in a frequently cited
statement that “[a] period of retroactivity longer than the year preceding the legislative
session in which the law was enacted would raise . . . serious constitutional questions,”
id. at 38 (O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment)?

       Second, is 2014 PA 282 consistent with the Michigan Due Process Clause, Const
1963, art 1, § 17, when that clause is worded differently than the federal Due Process
Clause and we have held that the state provision may afford heightened protections, Delta
Charter Twp v Dinolfo, 419 Mich. 253, 276 n 7 (1984), because “while the Federal
supreme court is the final judge of violations of the Federal Constitution, the decision of
the Supreme Court of this State is final on the question of whether or not a State statute
conflicts with the State Constitution,” People v Victor, 287 Mich. 506, 514 (1939)?

       Third, does 2014 PA 282 violate either the federal or state prohibitions against the
impairment of contracts, US Const, art I, § 10, cl 1; Const 1963, art 1, § 10, because the
Compact is a reciprocal and binding interstate compact between the signatory states with
respect to which a retroactive withdrawal from the Compact amounts to an
unconstitutional impairment of that contract, see Gillette Co v Franchise Tax Bd, 62 Cal
4th 468, 477-479 (2015)?

        Fourth, does 2014 PA 282 violate the Separation of Powers Clause, Const 1963,
art 3, § 2, because by prescribing the outcomes of those cases that were held in abeyance
pending IBM, as well as IBM itself, the Legislature has impinged on the judicial power,
Const 1963, art 6, § 1, and contravened the principle that “the Legislature cannot dictate
to the courts what their judgments shall be, or set aside or alter such judgments after they
                                                                                                                6

have been rendered,” People ex rel Sutherland v Governor, 29 Mich. 320, 325-326
(1874); cf. Plaut v Spendthrift Farm, Inc, 514 U.S. 211, 217-218 (1995) (“Congress has
exceeded its authority by requiring the federal courts to exercise ‘[t]he judicial Power of
the United States,’ U. S. Const., Art. III, § 1, in a manner repugnant to the text, structure,
and traditions of Article III.”)?

        As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, “[T]he power to tax involves
the power to destroy[.]” M‘Culloch v Maryland, 17 US (4 Wheat) 316, 431 (1819). This
power must be kept subject to proper constitutional limits, particularly when, as here, a
heightened tax burden has been imposed not on future business activities, but on business
activities planned and undertaken many years ago. While I do not yet have any firm
belief regarding the constitutionality of 2014 PA 282, I do have a firm belief that before
retroactive tax burdens such as those set forth in this law are imposed, the arguments of
affected taxpayers deserve consideration by the highest court of this state. Accordingly, I
respectfully dissent and would grant leave to appeal.

ADVANCE Interior Paint









































<

Choosing an Interior Paint Sheen
Sheen refers to paint's shininess. When deciding on paint sheen, consider the condition of the wall and whether the area is high/low traffic. Here's a partial list to get started:

Flat or matte sheen provides great depth of color and is ideal for less-than-perfect surfaces.
Eggshell, pearl and satin sheens are light, easy to clean, work great in high traffic areas, and reveal color with a softly polished glow.
Semi-gloss sheens are particularly durable and are often recommended for moldings and trim.

Choosing an Exterior Paint Sheen
Our super-premium products offer the same durability and washability in all sheens, so the selection of the finish is more of a personal preference. But here are a few things to remember:

Flat is good at hiding surface imperfections and delivers beautiful color.
Satin stays cleaner and stands up to abrasion better than Flat.
Semi-Gloss is more moisture resistant and easier to clean.
High-Gloss allows rich, deep color but magnifies surface imperfections.

Choosing a Stain Finish
Stain opacity levels range from clear to solid, with the amount of pigment in a stain determining its opacity. Translucent, Semi-Transparent, and Semi-Solid Stains are designed to protect without completely obscuring the natural color and texture of wood. As the opacity moves towards solid, less grain shows through the finish. In contrast, solid stains will completely mask the wood grain, while allowing the wood texture to show through, and the greater its protection will be over time.
What is VOC?
VOC means Volatile Organic Compounds. The paint industry is filled with definitions of what "green paint" is. Other manufacturers use tints that add VOCs to their paints, but Benjamin Moore's waterborne tinting technology ensures that our paints retain their low - or zero-VOC properties.
Green Promise®
Benjamin Moore's Green Promise® designation is our assurance that the product is environmentally-friendly and meets - and often exceeds - the strictest industry standards, while also delivering the premium levels of performance you expect from Benjamin Moore.
