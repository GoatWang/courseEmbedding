Mr. Brennan is a very knowledgeable man when it comes to plumbing! I have a particularly complicated problem that only Mr. Brennan was able to diagnose and correct. I can't tell you how much money I've thrown away on other contractors in an attempt to solve it. Finally done and done!

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Indiana:













Does Mark H Brennan carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Indiana are not required to be licensed to perform work on residential homes. Homeowners should check references, and perform due diligence when hiring a contractor in the state.
Mark H Brennan currently holds license PC19700237 (Plumber Contractor), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Indiana?



Indiana does not require contractors to take an exam or prove work experience. We advise homeowners to ask for multiple references when vetting a contractor to perform work on their homes.











Your liability risk when hiring Mark H Brennan



General Contractors in Indiana are not required to carry general liability insurance. It is always a good practice to only hire contractors with active liability and workers' compensation insurance policies. Request a copy of each certificate for your records before the project starts. 











Financial recourse when hiring Mark H Brennan



Indiana has a Plumbers Recovery fund to protect consumers from faulty workmanship, or damages incurred during plumbing related projects.











What else should I know before hiring Mark H Brennan



Due to Indianas minimal regulation regarding contractor licensing, consumers should be extra vigilant when hiring contractors, check on BuildZoom for customer reviews, and permit history as indicators of quality businesses.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Indiana, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
