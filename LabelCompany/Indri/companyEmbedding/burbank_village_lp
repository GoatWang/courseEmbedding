In Home Elder Care reviews in Burbank

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




Provider name locked. provided 24-hour in-home care for the past two months until my mother-in-law's passing two weeks ago.  She was gentle and loving as well as professional.  She went above and beyond what was expected.  I only hope that I will be as blessed.
 

            - Glenn S.          




We talked about my mother in law's decline in mental ability which was so severe she couldn't function on her own, and how it  interrupted her life in general.  Cooking, eating, and bathing became foreign to her.
We discussed her unpredictable changes in mood and and personality.  How she had withdrawn from all social contact, and her refusal to participate in family activities.   
How she was always misplacing things and losing her ability to retrace steps she had taken -  just 15 minutes ago.  We lost several cell phones and never recovered them.
She demonstrated a complete lack of ability to deal with  words in speaking - she could not express herself and relied on others to finish her sentences.,  She completely gave up writing notes or even signing her name, without help.  She had always done crossword puzzles, and now had no interest in working on them.
Provider name locked. explained how they could help, and handle the Alzheimer's patient.  We were 100% convinced that they could help us deal with her.   And most of all they would treat her with respect and dignity.
Thank You Provider name locked. Health
 

            - Donald M.          




Dad is a Tri-plegic - he had his shoulder operated on several months ago and is no longer able to lift his body weight. He is very limited on what he can do by himself and needs help getting in and out of bed, in and out of the shower, getting dressed and going to the bathroom.  

            - Terri L.
