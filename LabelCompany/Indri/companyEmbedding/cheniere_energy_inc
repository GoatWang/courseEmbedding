Sabine Pass LNG Terminal
The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located on over 1,000 acres of land along the Sabine Pass River on the border between Texas and Louisiana, in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. It is located at the widest point on the Sabine River Navigation Channel, only 3.7 nautical miles from the open water and 23 nautical miles from the outer buoy. The channel is maintained at a depth of 40 feet and is not subject to tidal limitations. The terminal has two docks that are recessed far enough so that no part of the LNG vessel will protrude into the open waterway while docked. 
Four dedicated tugs are stationed at the terminal to ensure safe and timely escorts by crews specifically trained to berth LNG vessels. The terminal can simultaneously load or unload LNG vessels from each berth in order to maximize the number of LNG vessels that can be received at the terminal each year.

About Cheniere Energy
Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE MKT: LNG) (Cheniere), is a Houston-based energy company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal and Creole Trail Pipeline located in Louisiana, through our general partner ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE MKT: CQP) (Cheniere Partners) and our partial ownership interest in Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (NYSE MKT: CQH).
Cheniere Partners is developing, constructing and operating a liquefaction project at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal (the "SPL Project") adjacent to the existing regasification facilities for up to six trains, with expected aggregate nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability and potential overdesign, of approximately 27.0 mtpa of LNG. Train 1 commenced operations in May 2016, Train 2 commenced operations in September 2016 and Train 3 commenced operations in March 2017. Trains 4-5 are currently under construction. All regulatory approvals have been received to construct and operate Train 6, and FID is expected to be reached upon obtaining an EPC contract, commercial contracts and financing sufficient to support construction.
Cheniere is developing and constructing additional liquefaction facilities near Corpus Christi, Texas (the "Corpus Christi LNG terminal"). The Corpus Christi LNG terminal is being designed for up to five trains, with expected aggregate nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability and potential overdesign, of approximately 22.5 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with capacity of approximately 13.5 Bcfe and two marine berths. Construction began on the first two trains in May 2016. All regulatory approvals have been received to construct and operate Train 3, and FID is expected to be reached upon obtaining commercial contracts and financing sufficient enough to support construction. Cheniere has also filed the NEPA pre-filing to commence the regulatory process on Train 4 and 5.
Cheniere is also engaged in the LNG and natural gas marketing business. Through its subsidiary, Cheniere Marketing, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Cheniere Marketing”), it is developing a portfolio of long-, medium- and short-term SPAs offering LNG on an FOB or DAT basis. Cheniere Marketing has purchased LNG from the SPL Project and other locations worldwide and transported and unloaded commercial LNG cargoes.

Corpus Christi LNG
Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC (Corpus Christi Liquefaction), a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy, is developing and constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal at one of Cheniere's existing sites that was previously permitted for a regasification terminal. The liquefaction project is being designed for five trains with expected aggregate nominal production capacity of up to 22.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG.
The Corpus Christi site is located on the La Quinta Channel on the northeast side of Corpus Christi Bay in San Patricio County, Texas, on over 1,000 acres owned or controlled by Cheniere and is approximately 15 nautical miles from the coast.
Cheniere made a Final Investment Decision (FID) and issued the notice to proceed to commence construction on the first two liquefaction trains on May 13, 2015, and is continuing to market nominal production capacity from Train 3.  To date, 8.42 mtpa has been contracted to third party, foundation customers on a long-term FOB basis under sale and purchase agreements (SPAs). Foundation customers include Pertamina, Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural Fenosa, Woodside, EDF and EDP. Trains 1&2 are fully contracted and Train 3 is partially contracted. Any excess capacity not sold under long-term SPAs to foundation customers is available for Cheniere Marketing.
Our business model differs from other U.S. LNG projects in that in addition to processing natural gas into LNG (tolling model), we will procure the natural gas supply used for feedstock. Once the natural gas is liquefied, the customer takes delivery at the tailgate of the terminal. As a result, Cheniere is expected to become one of the largest buyers of natural gas in the U.S. once all of the trains are operational.
Access to Gas Supply

The Corpus Christi Liquefaction Project is positioned near some of the most prolific oil and gas producing regions in the country. Texas alone produced 27% of total U.S. marketed gas production during 2015, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Cheniere is building a 23-mile 48” pipeline that would connect the Corpus Christi LNG plant to several interstate and intrastate pipelines, giving the facility access to robust gas resources in Texas and the Gulf Coast. In addition, Cheniere has secured transport capacity on third-party pipelines under long-term agreements. Natural gas supply will be purchased from producers and marketers on a short and long-term basis to form a balanced portfolio of natural gas feedstock.

Craft Development Program
Program Overview
Cheniere’s Craft Development Program is a workforce development program tailored to produce the highly skilled welders needed to support ongoing construction in the Gulf Coast and Coastal Bend regions. The program is designed for graduating high school students with welding experience and transitioning military veterans. 
Utilizing partnerships with local community colleges and Bechtel, our EPC contractor, the program consists of two distinct phases: (1) initial welding training at partner colleges or military installations; and (2) customized, advanced welder training at a Cheniere-sponsored training facility.
Once accepted into the program, participants start with structural welding and can advance to combination pipe welding and stainless steel welding over the course of 6 – 18 months depending on their skill level and aptitude. Program participants receive tuition reimbursement during the Phase 1 training and receive full-time pay during Phase 2, as well as additional financial incentives tied to their performance. Successful program graduates could have an opportunity to work at one of Cheniere’s projects currently under construction.

Locally Focused
Recruiting for the Craft Development Program is specifically focused around the communities where Cheniere operates to provide opportunities for candidates from the area. Geographically, there are 3 primary focus areas: (1) Southwest Louisiana; (2) Southeast Texas; and (3) the Coastal Bend Region of Texas. Currently the program is executed through strategic partnerships with Lamar Institute of Technology in Beaumont, SOWELA Technical Community College in Lake Charles, and Del Mar College in Corpus Christi. Additionally, the program sources candidates from over 20 high schools within those areas, as well as Fort Polk in Leesville, Louisiana.

LNG Terminals
Cheniere is among the leading companies in North America strategically pursuing the development, construction and operation of LNG terminals.
Cheniere's premier sites, community focused approach, experienced team and anticipated low construction and operating costs provides the company sustainable competitive advantages. The Company is currently developing, constructing and operating onshore LNG export facilities and related natural gas pipelines located along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast area is ideally situated for LNG facilities due to its highly liquid markets, with an abundant supply of natural gas and significant network of existing pipeline infrastructure. 
Cheniere's terminal sites are among the best in North America because these sites have the following critical features:

Deepwater ship channels and large acreage positions with proximity to open water 
Substantial local natural gas consumption & existing industrial complexes
Proximity to major interstate and intrastate pipelines 
Abundant and experienced workforce
​Local governments and communities familiar with and supportive of the energy industry 

Cheniere’s competitive advantage is offering attractive options for global LNG buyers:

New source of LNG supply for the global market
LNG pricing tied to U.S. natural gas index
More flexible contract structure, including destination flexibility, ability to cancel cargo lifting with advance notice and FOB purchases of LNG (Cheniere purchases the natural gas feedstock and the customer purchases LNG at the tailgate)
State-of-the-art technology – LNG trains are designed using the ConocoPhillips Optimized Cascade® process

Cheniere recently completed construction of the first 2 LNG trains to have been built in over 40 years in North America at its Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

Community Relations
Cheniere in the Community
The partnership with our host communities began with our facility siting efforts. The approach was largely educational including the properties of LNG, design considerations and regulations; and Cheniere’s business model and expertise. Cheniere values the relationship that has developed within the communities where we are developing our sites.
Cheniere believes education is the foundation of a strong community, so we look for ways to enhance educational opportunities for individuals. In addition to numerous scholarships and youth outreach activities, Cheniere sponsors other events that make quality educational programs more readily available to the community. Cheniere also understands the importance of medical care and health education to communities, so we partner with local leaders and national organizations to identify high-impact areas for support.
Cheniere is proud of the role we play in the communities where we operate and live - providing over one million dollars to worthy causes in the past 12 months. From rebuilding a children's park in Gregory, Texas, to supporting economic developments efforts in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Cheniere has established a long tradition of responsible corporate citizenship and will continue to build on our relationships with our neighbors in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas.


Energy Day 2016
On October 15, Cheniere employees participated in the annual Energy Day Festival in downtown Houston. Since its inception in 2011, Energy Day has helped spark students’ interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and the development of new energy technology. It is the nation’s largest energy festival and largest free event of its kind in Houston. Over 22,000 people visited more than 50 interactive exhibits and scientific demonstrations showcasing the ongoing advancements and innovations in the energy sector.
For the third year in a row, Cheniere’s booth was one of the most visited locations of the day. It featured live LNG demonstrations by Cheniere engineers to demonstrate how natural gas transforms into a liquid and its effects on common objects such as a rose, ping pong ball, water bottles and balloons. It also provided an opportunity for employees to discuss LNG safety and how it is will be used around the world.

On October 15, over 35 employees and family members came out to participate in the Inaugural Sabine Pass Lighthouse Run including 10K, 5K and 1 mile races. Cheniere was a major sponsor of the run held at Holly Beach, Louisiana that featured over 200 runners. Several members of the Cheniere family brought home medals.
The event raised over $30,000 and brought attention to the historic Sabine Pass Lighthouse restoration in Johnson Bayou, near Cheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal. The proceeds are being used to stabilize and restore the notable structure, which was operational from 1857 until 1952.  
“We had a great turnout and a much larger community response than we had hoped for. Without Cheniere and the greater community, this type of event simply could not occur,” said Andy Tingler, Cameron Preservation Alliance president.

Community Relations
Cheniere in the Community
The partnership with our host communities began with our facility siting efforts. The approach was largely educational including the properties of LNG, design considerations and regulations; and Cheniere’s business model and expertise. Cheniere values the relationship that has developed within the communities where we are developing our sites.
Cheniere believes education is the foundation of a strong community, so we look for ways to enhance educational opportunities for individuals. In addition to numerous scholarships and youth outreach activities, Cheniere sponsors other events that make quality educational programs more readily available to the community. Cheniere also understands the importance of medical care and health education to communities, so we partner with local leaders and national organizations to identify high-impact areas for support.
Cheniere is proud of the role we play in the communities where we operate and live - providing over one million dollars to worthy causes in the past 12 months. From rebuilding a children's park in Gregory, Texas, to supporting economic developments efforts in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Cheniere has established a long tradition of responsible corporate citizenship and will continue to build on our relationships with our neighbors in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas.

What is LNG?
Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is natural gas (methane) - the same clean, safe energy source used to fuel our homes and industries - that has been reduced to 1/600th its volume through a sophisticated refrigeration process that cools the gas until it liquefies (minus 260 degrees fahrenheit) into "LNG".

LNG is liquid natural gas which has been super-cooled to -260°F and changed from gas to liquid 
Liquefaction reduces volume by 600-to-1 
Stored cold in insulated containers at near atmospheric pressure 
LNG is colorless, odorless, non-corrosive, and non-toxic 
Becomes lighter than air when vaporized 

Liquefied Natural Gas is widely recognized as an environmentally friendly fuel source. Unlike other fossil fuels, it is non-carcinogenic and non-toxic. Because it is lighter than air, it dissipates quickly and has shown to pose little threat to marine life when transported. In the history of LNG oceanic transportation, there have been no incidents of containment loss. If such an incident were to occur, LNG would not mix with the water or form slicks that could harm flora or fauna. 
When liquefied, impurities such as sulfur, carbon dioxide, mercury and water are removed from natural gas and safely disposed of. This creates a product that is clean burning and safe for the environment. On average, LNG particle emissions are near zero. When compared to other fossil fuels, CO2 emissions are reduced by 70 percent. 
When in a liquid form, natural gas can be shipped long distances safely and economically in specially designed ships with insulated storage tanks. LNG has the appearance of mineral water and is neither shipped nor stored under pressure. Therefore, LNG fires are highly unlikely because of the extremely delicate fuel to oxygen balance necessary for combustion. The industry has, however, put in place extremely aggressive safety measures to ensure that fires are prevented and spills are contained.

About Cheniere Energy
Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE MKT: LNG) (Cheniere), is a Houston-based energy company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal and Creole Trail Pipeline located in Louisiana, through our general partner ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE MKT: CQP) (Cheniere Partners) and our partial ownership interest in Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (NYSE MKT: CQH).
Cheniere Partners is developing, constructing and operating a liquefaction project at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal (the "SPL Project") adjacent to the existing regasification facilities for up to six trains, with expected aggregate nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability and potential overdesign, of approximately 27.0 mtpa of LNG. Train 1 commenced operations in May 2016, Train 2 commenced operations in September 2016 and Train 3 commenced operations in March 2017. Trains 4-5 are currently under construction. All regulatory approvals have been received to construct and operate Train 6, and FID is expected to be reached upon obtaining an EPC contract, commercial contracts and financing sufficient to support construction.
Cheniere is developing and constructing additional liquefaction facilities near Corpus Christi, Texas (the "Corpus Christi LNG terminal"). The Corpus Christi LNG terminal is being designed for up to five trains, with expected aggregate nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability and potential overdesign, of approximately 22.5 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with capacity of approximately 13.5 Bcfe and two marine berths. Construction began on the first two trains in May 2016. All regulatory approvals have been received to construct and operate Train 3, and FID is expected to be reached upon obtaining commercial contracts and financing sufficient enough to support construction. Cheniere has also filed the NEPA pre-filing to commence the regulatory process on Train 4 and 5.
Cheniere is also engaged in the LNG and natural gas marketing business. Through its subsidiary, Cheniere Marketing, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Cheniere Marketing”), it is developing a portfolio of long-, medium- and short-term SPAs offering LNG on an FOB or DAT basis. Cheniere Marketing has purchased LNG from the SPL Project and other locations worldwide and transported and unloaded commercial LNG cargoes. Cheniere Marketing is expected to have access to excess LNG from the SPL Project and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal not sold under long-term sale and purchase agreements to third parties.
Cheniere continues to evaluate the energy markets for additional development and/or marketing opportunities that would leverage the existing platform and strategically fit within the Cheniere organization.

HOUSTON, Dec. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cheniere Energy, Inc. ("Cheniere") (NYSE MKT: LNG) announced today that it has terminated negotiations with the conflicts committee of the board of directors of Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC ("Cheniere Partners Holdings") (NYSE MKT: CQH) regarding Cheniere's previously announced non-binding proposal to acquire all of the publicly held shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings not already owned by Cheniere in a stock-for-stock merger transaction. 








The proposed transaction was subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and approval of such definitive agreement by the board of directors of Cheniere, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings and a conflicts committee established by the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings. As previously announced, the consideration initially offered by Cheniere was 0.5049 Cheniere shares for each outstanding publicly-held share of Cheniere Partners Holdings, which represented a premium of approximately 3.0% over the closing price of Cheniere Partners Holdings' shares based on the closing prices of Cheniere Partners Holdings' shares and of Cheniere's shares as of September 29, 2016, or a premium of approximately 7.0% over the 30-trading day average CQH / LNG exchange ratio as of September 29, 2016. After more than 6 weeks of negotiations, and despite raising the offer to an exchange ratio of 0.54 (representing a premium of approximately 10% over the closing price of Cheniere Partners Holdings' shares based on the closing prices of Cheniere Partners Holdings' shares and of Cheniere's shares as of September 29, 2016, or a premium of approximately 14% over the 30-trading day average CQH / LNG exchange ratio as of September 29, 2016), Cheniere has determined that no acceptable definitive agreement can be reached with the conflicts committee at this time. 
Cheniere currently owns 80.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings. Cheniere may, subject to market and general economic conditions and other factors, purchase additional shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time.

In particular, statements using words such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "plan," "project," "intend," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "pursue," "target," "continue," the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology generally involve forward-looking statements.

Cheniere Energy, Inc.: Buy at the High?
The LNG export company is riding high thanks to robust growth and rising optimism.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            May 23, 2017 at 1:03PM
            
            





Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) and its two affiliates, Cheniere Energy Partners Holding (NYSEMKT:CQH) and Cheniere Energy Partners (NYSEMKT:CQP), have been riding high this year, with all three stocks recently touching 52-week highs. Fueling that bullish buying is a combination of factors, including Cheniere Energy's robust first-quarter results and reports that it is in talks to increase liquefied natural gas shipments to China.
All this bullishness certainly raises the question of whether investors should wait for a pullback before investing in Cheniere or one of its affiliates. While that patience might pay off if there is a sell-off, investors who look at the bigger picture might still want to buy even though the stock is at the high.

The trains are just starting to roll out
Cheniere Energy is in the midst of a transformation from an LNG project developer into a global LNG exporting powerhouse. Driving that shift is the start-up of commercial operations at the first of its Sabine Pass liquefaction trains last November. It has since completed two more trains that should start commercial deliveries later this year. In the interim, these trains combined to load 43 LNG cargoes during the first quarter, which includes seven commissioning cargos. Those shipments enabled Cheniere and its affiliates to record $1.2 billion in revenue in the quarter, which is a stratospheric rise for a franchise that only produced $69 million in revenue during last year's first quarter. Meanwhile, Cheniere recorded $483 million in adjusted EBITDA, a remarkable amount for a company that posted a negative $45 million in adjusted EBITDA during last year's first quarter. 
Those strong results are only the beginning. That's because it didn't start commercial activities on Train 3 until the end of the quarter. Meanwhile, Cheniere just started commissioning activities on its newest expansion, Train 4, which it expects to complete later this year. Because of that staggered start, revenue and earnings should steadily rise for the next few years from these four trains alone.
However, Sabine Pass is just the first of its LNG export developments. Cheniere also has a project at Corpus Christi under construction, with the first of its two trains expected to enter service in the first half of 2019 and 2020, respectively. Meanwhile, it has another train at Sabine Pass that should enter service in late 2019. Once all those trains come on line, Cheniere will be the fifth-largest LNG export company in the world. That said, it still has more expansions in development, including another fully permitted train at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi and it recently bought land adjacent to Corpus Christi to develop two more trains.

Capturing a colossal opportunity
The company has most of its financial growth locked up since it has signed 20-year take-or-pay contracts with customers for 87% of total capacity, which includes trains both completed and under construction. However, while it intends to hold back at least 5% of capacity to capture opportunities in the spot market, it would jump at the chance to sign additional capacity to long-term contracts. 
That's where recent news that Cheniere has had extensive negotiations with China about increasing LNG shipments to the country might prove to be another catalyst for the stock. To date, it has sold nine cargos to China since it started exporting gas last February, though all were spot market volumes as part of its commissioning process. Ideally, Cheniere would like to secure long-term contracts with China for some of its available capacity as well as for the trains it hasn't started constructing because they're not yet fully commercialized. 
China would be an ideal destination for this capacity given that it's expected to drive LNG demand growth over the next decade. According to a report from leading LNG producer Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B), global LNG demand should rise 4% to 5% annually through 2030, driven in large part by China's desire to boost LNG imports as a percentage of its energy mix from 5% to 15%. If that were to happen, China would represent 20% of total global LNG demand, according to Shell. Because of that forecast, the country represents an enormous untapped market opportunity for Cheniere. 





Investor takeaway
Cheniere Energy is riding high these days thanks to the stunning growth it has experienced since completing its first three LNG trains. That said, it still has unprecedented growth ahead of it given the trains it still has under construction and in development, which would only heighten if it can finally start making inroads into the rapidly growing Chinese market. Because of this, investors who buy at the high could still be rewarded handsomely by holding for the long term and letting the thesis play out.

Press Releases



Cheniere Energy, Inc. Announces Achievement of Regulatory and Financial Milestones for the Midship Pipeline Project






Jun 2, 2017, 8:00am EDT














HOUSTON, June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cheniere Energy, Inc. ("Cheniere") (NYSE MKT: LNG) announced today that it has achieved important regulatory and financial milestones related to the development of its previously announced 200-mile 36-inch interstate natural gas pipeline project (the "Midship Project").
Midship Pipeline Company, LLC ("Midship") has filed an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") with respect to the Midship Project. Midship currently targets receipt of FERC authorization in early 2018 and in-service of the Midship Project in late 2018 or early 2019.
"The filing of the FERC application is an important development for the Midship Project as we continue to progress the project forward. Midship is being developed to provide a solution to producers in the Anadarko Basin that will ensure their product can reach growing demand markets along the Gulf Coast, including LNG exports," said Jack A. Fusco, Cheniere's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The Midship Project demonstrates the capability and breadth of the Cheniere platform as we continue to execute on our project development plans."
In addition to filing the FERC application, Midship Holdings, LLC ("Midship Holdings") has entered into agreements with investment funds managed by EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG") under which EIG-managed funds have committed to make an investment of up to $500 million (the "EIG Investment") in the Midship Project, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable agreements. Subject to Midship Holdings making a positive Final Investment Decision with respect to the Midship Project, the EIG Investment, and equity contributed by Cheniere, is intended to ensure that the project has the equity funding expected to be required to develop and construct up to the full project design of 1,440,000 Dekatherms per day of throughput capacity. Credit Suisse acted as exclusive financial advisor to Cheniere on the EIG Investment.
"We are pleased to once again work with Cheniere on this important American energy infrastructure project," said Wallace Henderson, Managing Director of EIG. "EIG has previously worked with Cheniere on the Corpus Christi Liquefaction terminal, and is now excited to extend that successful relationship further along the LNG and midstream value chain."
The Midship Project is being developed to create pipeline capacity of up to 1,440,000 Dekatherms per day of firm transportation to connect production from the emerging STACK and SCOOP resource plays in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma to growing Gulf Coast and Southeast markets. The Midship Project is expected to consist of approximately 200 miles of 36 inch diameter new mainline pipeline, several laterals, compressor stations and interconnects that will provide receipts from STACK and SCOOP processing plants and provide deliveries to Bennington, Oklahoma, as well as access to downstream markets including the TexOk hub near Atlanta, Texas, and the Perryville Hub near Tallulah, Louisiana. As previously disclosed, Midship has secured commitments from subsidiaries and/or affiliates of Cheniere, Devon Energy Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, and Gulfport Energy Corporation to support initial construction of approximately 1,000,000 Dekatherms per day of capacity. 
Midship Holdings would require acceptable financing arrangements, which may include project financings and offerings by it or its subsidiaries of debt or equity, and regulatory and other approvals before the proposed project begins construction.

Directly and through its subsidiary, Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P., Cheniere is developing, constructing, and operating liquefaction projects near Corpus Christi, Texas and at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, respectively.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
