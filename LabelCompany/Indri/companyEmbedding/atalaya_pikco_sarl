Spanish call center operator Atento SA IPO-ATTO.N, owned by private equity firm Bain Capital Partners LLC, said it expected its initial public offering to be priced $19-$22 per share, valuing the company at up to $1.60 billion.
At the top end of the expected price range, the IPO is likely to raise about $321.8 million. (1.usa.gov/1wlPrsM)
Bain Capital bought Atento Group from Telefonica SA (TEF.MC), Europe’s biggest telecom operator by revenue, in 2012 for about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), including debt.
In the offering of about 14.6 million shares, Atento is selling 4.1 million shares and stockholder Atalaya PikCo SCA the rest.
Bain Capital’s stake in Atento will drop to 75.3 percent from 98.2 percent if the underwriters fully exercise their option.
Atento, which runs helpdesks, back offices and other service desks, has about 153,000 employees, with about half of them in Brazil.
The company was formed in 1999 as a spinoff of Telefonica’s call center business in Spain, Peru and Chile.
Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Atento was likely to launch its offering as early as this week.
Atento’s loss attributable to shareholders widened to $24.3 million in the six months ended June from $23.1 million, a year earlier. Revenue dropped about 1.2 percent to $1.15 billion.

	Business

	ATTO is the largest provider of CRM BPO services in Latin America and Spain, and among the top three providers globally, based on revenues.

	ATTO’s business was founded in 1999 as the CRM BPO provider to the Telefónica Group. Since then, ATTO has significantly diversified its client base, and subsequent to the Acquisition in December 2012, ATTO became an independent company. 

 

	As the largest provider of CRM BPO services in Latin America, ATTO holds #1 market share positions in most of the countries where ATTO operates, based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, according to Frost & Sullivan. From 2009 to 2012, ATTO expanded its CRM BPO market leadership position in Latin America overall from 19.1% to 20.1% and increased its market share in Brazil from 23.3% in 2009 to 25.5% in 2013, based on revenue.

	ATTO has achieved a leadership position over a 15-year history through a dedicated focus on superior client service, a scaled and reliable technology and operational platform, a deep understanding of  clients’ diverse local needs and our highly engaged employee base. Given its growth outlook, Latin America is one of the most attractive CRM BPO markets globally and ATTO believes it is distinctly positioned as one of the few scale operators in the region.

	CRM BPO services

	ATTO offers a comprehensive portfolio of CRM BPO services, including customer service, sales, credit management, technical support, service desk and back office services.

	ATTO is evolving from offering individual CRM BPO services to combining multiple service offerings, covering both the front-end and the back-end of clients’ customer experience, into customized solutions adapted to clients’ needs.

	ATTO believes that these customized customer solutions provide an improved experience for clients’ customers and create stronger customer relationships, which reinforces clients’ brand recognition and enhances customer loyalty. Services and solutions are delivered across multiple channels including digital (SMS, email, chats, social media and apps, among others) and voice, and are enabled by process design, technology and intelligence functions.

	In 2013, CRM BPO solutions and individual services comprised approximately 23% and 77% of revenues, respectively. In Brazil, the CRM BPO solutions segment grew from 16% of revenue in 2011 to 35% of  revenue in 2013.

	ATTO's CRM BPO services and solutions are delivered through an innovative multi-channel platform.

	As clients’ customers become more connected and widely broadcast their experiences across a variety of digital channels, ATTO believes the quality of their customer experience is having a significant impact on clients’ brand loyalty and overall business performance.

	ATTO's multi-channel platform integrates direct customer outreach through digital, voice or in-person channels allowing ATTO to engage with customers through multiple channels of interaction.

	As clients’ customers increasingly transition towards digital communication, ATTO has evolved and invested in digital channel capabilities.

	Intellectual property

	ATTO believes the “Atento” trademark is a recognized and trusted brand in the CRM BPO services industry in each of the markets where ATTO operates.

	ATTO believes it has a strong corporate brand that gives credibility to our products and may offer and facilitate our entrance and growth into future market. This also allows ATTO to attract and retain the best talent, to generate a sense of pride in its staff and to develop a relationship of commitment, confidence and trust with clients. On May 24, 2011, ATTO executed an agreement with Telefónica regarding the assignment of all trademarks and commercial names owned by Telefónica, which included the “Atento” trademark.

	In addition, the trend toward off-shore outsourcing, international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes may result in new and different competitors entering ATTO's markets. These competitors may include entrants from the communications, software and data networking industries or entrants in geographical locations with lower costs than those in which ATTO operates.

	5% shareholders pre-IPO

	Atalaya PikCo S.C.A. 78.3%

	Dividend Policy

	No dividends planned

	Although ATTO expects to be well capitalized following the Reorganization Transaction prior to the completion of this offering and ATTO has sufficient liquidity, its ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares is limited in the near-term by the indenture governing its Senior Secured Notes, the Brazilian Debentures, the Vendor Loan Note and ATTO's CVIs, and may be further restricted by the terms of any of its future debt or preferred securities.

	In addition, under Luxembourg law, at least 5% of ATTO’s net profits per year must be allocated to the creation of a legal reserve until such reserve has reached an amount equal to 10% of issued share capital.

	If the legal reserve subsequently falls below the 10% threshold, 5% of net profits again must be allocated toward the reserve until such reserve returns to the 10% threshold. If the legal reserve exceeds 10% of issued share capital, the legal reserve may be reduced. The legal reserve is not available for distribution.

	Use of proceeds

	ATTO intends to use proceeds from its IPO with cash on hand as follows:

	-- to repay the entire $31.4 million (at the exchange rate prevailing as of June 30, 2014) outstanding amount due under ATTO’s Vendor Loan Note as of June 30, 2014 and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with this offering.

	-- ATTO will use any remaining net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes.

	ATTO expects that the selling shareholder will use $108 million of the net proceeds received by it in this offering to repay a portion of its outstanding PIK Notes due 2020.

CRM BPO = customer relationship management and business process outsourcing
ConclusionNegative-$21 per share dilution, 32 times tangible book valueRev, operating income, earnings, EBITDA all downOperating income only 2.8% of rev, P/E of -31
To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.
BusinessATTO is the largest provider of CRM BPO services in Latin America and Spain, and among the top three providers globally, based on revenues.
ATTO's business was founded in 1999 as the CRM BPO provider to the Telefónica Group. Since then, ATTO has significantly diversified its client base, and subsequent to the Acquisition in December 2012, ATTO became an independent company.

As the largest provider of CRM BPO services in Latin America, ATTO holds #1 market share positions in most of the countries where ATTO operates, based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, according to Frost & Sullivan. From 2009 to 2012, ATTO expanded its CRM BPO market leadership position in Latin America overall from 19.1% to 20.1% and increased its market share in Brazil from 23.3% in 2009 to 25.5% in 2013, based on revenue.
ATTO has achieved a leadership position over a 15-year history through a dedicated focus on superior client service, a scaled and reliable technology and operational platform, a deep understanding of clients' diverse local needs and our highly engaged employee base. Given its growth outlook, Latin America is one of the most attractive CRM BPO markets globally and ATTO believes it is distinctly positioned as one of the few scale operators in the region.
CRM BPO servicesATTO offers a comprehensive portfolio of CRM BPO services, including customer service, sales, credit management, technical support, service desk and back office services.
ATTO is evolving from offering individual CRM BPO services to combining multiple service offerings, covering both the front-end and the back-end of clients' customer experience, into customized solutions adapted to clients' needs.
ATTO believes that these customized customer solutions provide an improved experience for clients' customers and create stronger customer relationships, which reinforces clients' brand recognition and enhances customer loyalty. Services and solutions are delivered across multiple channels including digital (SMS, email, chats, social media and apps, among others) and voice, and are enabled by process design, technology and intelligence functions.
In 2013, CRM BPO solutions and individual services comprised approximately 23% and 77% of revenues, respectively. In Brazil, the CRM BPO solutions segment grew from 16% of revenue in 2011 to 35% of revenue in 2013.
ATTO's CRM BPO services and solutions are delivered through an innovative multi-channel platform.

As clients' customers become more connected and widely broadcast their experiences across a variety of digital channels, ATTO believes the quality of their customer experience is having a significant impact on clients' brand loyalty and overall business performance.
ATTO's multi-channel platform integrates direct customer outreach through digital, voice or in-person channels allowing ATTO to engage with customers through multiple channels of interaction.
As clients' customers increasingly transition towards digital communication, ATTO has evolved and invested in digital channel capabilities.
Intellectual propertyATTO believes the "Atento" trademark is a recognized and trusted brand in the CRM BPO services industry in each of the markets where ATTO operates.
ATTO believes it has a strong corporate brand that gives credibility to our products and may offer and facilitate our entrance and growth into future market. This also allows ATTO to attract and retain the best talent, to generate a sense of pride in its staff and to develop a relationship of commitment, confidence and trust with clients. On May 24, 2011, ATTO executed an agreement with Telefónica regarding the assignment of all trademarks and commercial names owned by Telefónica, which included the "Atento" trademark.
CompetitionIn addition, the trend toward off-shore outsourcing, international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes may result in new and different competitors entering ATTO's markets. These competitors may include entrants from the communications, software and data networking industries or entrants in geographical locations with lower costs than those in which ATTO operates.
5% shareholders pre-IPOAtalaya PikCo S.C.A. 78.3%
Dividend PolicyNo dividends planned
Although ATTO expects to be well capitalized following the Reorganization Transaction prior to the completion of this offering and ATTO has sufficient liquidity, its ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares is limited in the near-term by the indenture governing its Senior Secured Notes, the Brazilian Debentures, the Vendor Loan Note and ATTO's CVIs, and may be further restricted by the terms of any of its future debt or preferred securities.

In addition, under Luxembourg law, at least 5% of ATTO's net profits per year must be allocated to the creation of a legal reserve until such reserve has reached an amount equal to 10% of issued share capital.
If the legal reserve subsequently falls below the 10% threshold, 5% of net profits again must be allocated toward the reserve until such reserve returns to the 10% threshold. If the legal reserve exceeds 10% of issued share capital, the legal reserve may be reduced. The legal reserve is not available for distribution.
Use of proceedsATTO intends to use proceeds from its IPO with cash on hand as follows:
-- to repay the entire $31.4 million (at the exchange rate prevailing as of June 30, 2014) outstanding amount due under ATTO's Vendor Loan Note as of June 30, 2014 and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with this offering.
-- ATTO will use any remaining net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes.
ATTO expects that the selling shareholder will use $108 million of the net proceeds received by it in this offering to repay a portion of its outstanding PIK Notes due 2020.
