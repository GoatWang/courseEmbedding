Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements




	For the period ending March 31, 2017




	(Unaudited)



	 



	NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS



	 


	Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers, Inc., f/k/a Electric Vehicle Research Corporation (hereinafter “AEPP” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in June 2013. We were formed as a consultant to the electric vehicle research and technologies industry. During 2015 we decided to redirect our activities into more direct energy operations through a planned acquisition of exploration properties in Peru. See Note 5. Our management and directors resigned during January 2017, and an existing stockholder was appointed as the sole officer and director (along with his affiliates that own common stock, herein referred to as “Interim Management”). During February 2017, the planned acquisition of the Peruvian exploration properties was terminated because of the failure to complete the terms of the acquisition. Immediately following this termination, AEPP had limited or no operating activities and no tangible assets, but had significant liabilities.


	 


	During February 2017, in order to prepare the Company for the development or adoption of a new plan of operations, AEPP adopted a plan to exchange our common stock for our outstanding debt. On March 1, 2017, Interim Management was issued 60,000,000 shares of common stock to pay, acquire or reach agreement with AEPP’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of AEPP and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations, including any fees for services rendered. The face value of such liabilities extinguished totaled $266,010, excluding any compensation to Interim Management for services rendered.


	 


	On March 6, 2017, Interim Management agreed to sell all of its common stock to Oncolix, Inc. (“Oncolix”), a Houston-based clinical-stage biotechnology company, after the completion of the plan to extinguish liabilities and after certain other conditions were met. Interim Management reached agreement with its creditors for such extinguishment by March 31, 2017. As of such date, AEPP had no assets, no operating activities, and no liabilities, and was dependent on Interim Management to fund its corporate activities.


	 


	On April 6, 2017, Interim Management completed the sale 61,465,130 shares of common stock (including the 1,465,130 shares previously owned and the 60,000,000 shares received to implement the debt extinguishment plan) to Oncolix. Interim Management resigned all positions with the Company, and two officers of Oncolix were appointed as the sole Directors of AEPP, resulting in a change in control of AEPP.


	 


	As of this date, Oncolix has announced no specific plans regarding its ownership interest in AEPP, but Oncolix is considering the possible acquisition by AEPP of Oncolix’s operations through a reverse merger transaction. There can be no assurances that such a transaction will be proposed by Oncolix or will be consummated, nor of the terms of any such transaction. Oncolix has agreed to advance funds to AEPP on a month-to-month basis to continue AEPP’s corporate activities. There can be no assurances that such Oncolix will continue such arrangement.


	 



	NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. As of April 2017, the Company has no cash, no tangible assets and no intellectual property, and is currently dependent on its majority stockholder, Oncolix, to fund its corporate activities on a month-to-month basis. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it develops or acquires an operating business and becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company currently is dependent on Oncolix to advance funds for the Company’s corporate activities. However, management cannot provide any assurance that Oncolix will continue to fund such activities, or that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to acquire or develop operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern

	NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANICAL STATEMENTS



	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles, for complete financial statements please refer to our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.


	 


	In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.


	 



	USE OF ESTIMATES



	The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS



	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $0 at March 31, 2017 and $1,671 at December 31, 2016.


	 



	CASH FLOWS REPORTING



	The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period.


	 



	RELATED PARTIES



	The Company follows ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.


	 



	REVENUE RECOGNITION



	The Company follows ASC 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 


	The Company had no revenue in the three-month periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2016.

	Table of Contents






	 



	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



	The Company expenses research and development costs when incurred. Historically, research and development costs included engineering and testing of product and outputs. Indirect costs related to research and developments were allocated based on percentage usage to the research and development. The Company did not incur research or development costs in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	   



	DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND VALUATION ALLOWANCE



	The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.


	 



	NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE



	Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.


	 


	Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had no dilutive potential common shares.


	 



	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the

	FASB Accounting Standards Codification™

	(“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed these rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.


	 


	We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our management and certain standards are under consideration.


	 



	NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES



	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for Federal income tax purposes. As a result of the issuance of shares of common stock in exchange for indebtedness and the sale of shares held by Interim Management to Oncolix (see Note 7), the ability of the Company to utilize this net operating loss carryforward to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited. Accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are fully offset by a valuation allowance.


	 


	Deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carryforwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realizability.

	NOTE 5. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY



	 


	The Company, through approval of its Board of Directors, authorized common shares of 500,000,000 with a par value of $0.0001.


	 



	COMMON STOCK



	On October 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company named 1923285 Alberta Ltd (“Alberta”) for 65,600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. It was agreed that 65,600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and 100% of the issued and outstanding Alberta shares would be held in escrow until Alberta provided the Company with audited financial statements and until the Company completed its due diligence. Certain shares were released from escrow in 2016. On February 10, 2017, the Alberta agreement was terminated and the remaining 60,680,000 shares of common stock in escrow were cancelled. There were no penalties related to the termination.


	 


	During February 2017, in order to prepare the Company for the development or adoption of a new plan of operations, AEPP adopted a plan to exchange our common stock for our outstanding debt. On March 1, 2017, Interim Management was issued 60,000,000 shares of common stock to pay, acquire or reach agreement with AEPP’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of AEPP and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations, including any fees for services rendered. The recorded amount of such liabilities extinguished totaled $266,010, excluding any compensation to Interim Management for services rendered. Interim Management reached agreement with its creditors for such extinguishment by March 31, 2017. The 60,000,000 shares issued to Interim Management were recorded at the closing trading price of AEPP common stock on March 1, 2017, or $0.0085 per share. As a result, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $243,990 (the $266,010 face value of the liabilities extinguished less the $510,000 market price of the common stock issued to Interim Management) was recorded in the three months ending March 31, 2017.


	 


	There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company as of March 31, 2017.


	 



	NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	 


	From time to time the Company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.


	 





	NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	On March 6, 2017, Interim Management agreed to sell all of its common stock to Oncolix, Inc. (“Oncolix”), a Houston-based clinical-stage biotechnology company, after the completion of the plan to extinguish liabilities (see Note 1) and after certain other conditions were met. Interim Management reached agreement with its creditors for such extinguishment by March 31, 2017. On April 6, 2017, Interim Management completed the sale 61,465,130 shares of common stock (including the 1,465,130 shares previously owned and the 60,000,000 shares received to implement the debt extinguishment plan) to Oncolix. Interim Management resigned all positions with the Company, and two officers of Oncolix were appointed as the sole Directors of AEPP, resulting in a change in control of AEPP.


	 


	As of this date, Oncolix has announced no specific plans regarding its ownership interest in AEPP, but Oncolix is considering the possible acquisition by AEPP of Oncolix’s operations through a reverse merger transaction. There can be no assurances that such a transaction will be proposed by Oncolix or will be consummated, nor of the terms of any such transaction. Subsequent to the acquisition of AEPP stock, Oncolix has agreed to advance funds to AEPP on a month-to-month basis to continue AEPP’s corporate activities. There can be no assurances that such Oncolix will continue such arrangement.

	Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.




	 


	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers Inc., f/k/a, Electric Vehicle Research Corporation for the period ended March 31, 2017, contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward looking statements which, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements under the section Notes to Condensed Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements. Where in any forward looking statements the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.


	 


	The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; the availability of future funding; the availability of business opportunities, including possible proposals by Oncolix for changes in future operations; the willingness and ability of stockholders to fund corporate activities; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal proceedings.


	 


	You should not rely on forward looking statements in this quarterly report. This quarterly report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “future,” “intends,” and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.


	 




	Our Business Overview




	 


	We were formed as a consultant to the electric vehicle research and technologies industry. During 2015 we decided to redirect our activities into more direct energy operations through a planned acquisition of exploration properties in Peru. Our management and directors resigned during January 2017, and an existing stockholder was appointed as the sole officer and director (along with his affiliates that own common stock, herein referred to as “Interim Management”). During February 2017, the planned acquisition of the Peruvian exploration properties was terminated because of the failure to complete the terms of the acquisition. Immediately following this termination, AEPP had limited or no operating activities and no tangible assets, but had significant liabilities.


	 


	During February 2017, in order to prepare the Company for the development or adoption of a new plan of operations, AEPP adopted a plan to exchange our common stock for our outstanding debt. On March 1, 2017, Interim Management was issued 60,000,000 shares of common stock to pay, acquire or reach agreement with AEPP’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of AEPP and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations, including any fees for services rendered. The face value of such liabilities extinguished totaled $266,010, excluding any compensation to Interim Management for services rendered.


	 


	On March 6, 2017, Interim Management agreed to sell all of its common stock to Oncolix, Inc.

	As of this date, Oncolix has announced no specific plans regarding its ownership interest in AEPP, but Oncolix is considering the possible acquisition by AEPP of Oncolix’s operations through a reverse merger transaction. There can be no assurances that such a transaction will be proposed by Oncolix or will be consummated, nor of the terms of any such transaction. Oncolix has agreed to advance funds to AEPP on a month-to-month basis to continue AEPP’s corporate activities. There can be no assurances that such Oncolix will continue such arrangement.


	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. As of April 2017, the Company has no cash, no tangible assets, and no intellectual property, and is currently dependent on its majority stockholder, Oncolix, to fund its corporate activities on a month-to-month basis. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it develops or acquires an operating business and becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company currently is dependent on Oncolix to advance funds for the Company’s corporate activities. However, management cannot provide any assurance that Oncolix will continue to fund such activities, or that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to acquire or develop operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern


	 




	Plan of Operation




	 


	Our plan of operation for the next twelve months will be to develop or acquire business operations that may provide an opportunity for our shareholders. Such opportunity may include a reverse merger with Oncolix, or other opportunities if such are identified. There can be no assurances that such a transaction will be proposed by Oncolix be or consummated, nor of the terms of any such transaction.


	 


	We are currently dependent on Oncolix to fund our operations, and Oncolix has agreed to advance funds to AEPP on a month-to-month basis to continue AEPP’s corporate activities. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offerings of our company’s securities. We believe we need to establish a business plan prior to such activities. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See “Note 2 – Going Concern” in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a “going concern.”


	   



	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

	 


	 


	We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:


	 







	 





	·





	 




	A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;





	 







	 





	·





	 




	Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;





	 







	 





	·





	 




	Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and





	 







	 





	·





	 




	No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.





	 


	We have taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-Q, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).


	 




	 




	11







	 






	Table of Contents






	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.


	 


	We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


	 


	We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.


	  



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	We prepare our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our condensed financial statements.


	 


	While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.


	 


	For a full description of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.


	 




	Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 



	Revenues




	 



	The Company did not have any revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 



	Operating and Other Expenses




	 



	Total expenses for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $285,590 and $20,589, respectively. These included $41,800 and $20,589 of selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, and we did not incur any research and development expenses. The increase in 2017 was principally related to the costs of the audit of the year ended December 31, 2016, incurred in 2017, and the filing of the Form 10-K Annual Report.

	The expenses in 2017 included a loss on the extinguishment of $243,990. The Company issued 60,000,000 shares to Interim Management in connection with the extinguishment of liabilities and financial obligations. The 60,000,000 shares issued to Interim Management were recorded at the closing trading price of AEPP common stock on March 1, 2017, or $0.0085 per share. As a result, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $243,990 (the $266,010 face value of the liabilities extinguished less the $510,000 market price of the common stock issued to Interim Management) was recorded in the three months ending March 31, 2017.


	 


	The Company had no employees in 2017, and the CEO and Director (the Interim Management as noted above) was not paid in cash for services rendered.


	  



	Financial Condition




	 



	We were formed as a consultant to the electric vehicle research and technologies industry. During 2015 we decided to redirect our activities into more direct energy operations through a planned acquisition of exploration properties in Peru. Our management and directors resigned during January 2017, and an existing stockholder was appointed as the sole officer and director (along with his affiliates that own common stock, herein referred to as “Interim Management”). During February 2017, the planned acquisition of the Peruvian exploration properties was terminated because of the failure to complete the terms of the acquisition. Immediately following this termination, AEPP had limited or no operating activities, no tangible assets and no intellectual property, but had significant liabilities.


	 


	During February 2017, in order to prepare the Company for the development or adoption of a new plan of operations, AEPP adopted a plan to exchange our common stock for our outstanding debt. On March 1, 2017, Interim Management was issued 60,000,000 shares of common stock to pay, acquire or reach agreement with AEPP’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of AEPP and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations, including any fees for services rendered. The face value of such liabilities extinguished totaled $266,010, excluding any compensation to Interim Management for services rendered.


	   


	On March 6, 2017, Interim Management agreed to sell all of its common stock to Oncolix after the completion of the plan to extinguish liabilities and after certain other conditions were met. Interim Management reached agreement with its creditors for such extinguishment by March 31, 2017. As of such date, AEPP had no assets, no operating activities, and no liabilities, and was dependent on Interim Management to fund its corporate activities.


	 


	On April 6, 2017, Interim Management completed the sale 61,465,130 shares of common stock (including the 1,465,130 shares previously owned and the 60,000,000 shares received to implement the debt extinguishment plan) to Oncolix. Interim Management resigned all positions with the Company, and two officers of Oncolix were appointed as the sole Directors of AEPP, resulting in a change in control of AEPP.


	 


	As of this date, Oncolix has announced no specific plans regarding its ownership interest in AEPP, but Oncolix is considering the possible acquisition by AEPP of Oncolix’s operations through a reverse merger transaction. There can be no assurances that such a transaction will be proposed by Oncolix or will be consummated, nor of the terms of any such transaction. Oncolix has agreed to advance funds to AEPP on a month-to-month basis to continue AEPP’s corporate activities. There can be no assurances that such Oncolix will continue such arrangement.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 



	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. As of April 2017, the Company has no cash, no tangible assets and no intellectual property, and is currently dependent on its majority stockholder, Oncolix, to fund its corporate activities on a month-to-month basis. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it develops or acquires an operating business and becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

	Table of Contents






	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company currently is dependent on Oncolix to advance funds for the Company’s corporate activities. However, management cannot provide any assurance that Oncolix will continue to fund such activities, or that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to acquire or develop operations. The Company sustained a loss for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and 2016 of $285,790 and $23,782, respectively. These costs were principally related to corporate activities, including the extinguishment of liabilities. The Company has an accumulated loss of $5,662,354 as of March 31, 2017. Because of the absence of significant operations or assets, or positive cash flows therefrom, the Company will require additional funding to establish or acquire operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,671 and $0, respectively.


	 


	Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0 and $0, respectively.


	  


	We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to establish or acquire operations. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be the acquisition of operations through the issuance of debt or equity from private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to establish operations or generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. See Plan of Operation.


	 


	We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.


	 



	Capital Resources.




	 



	We had no material commitments for any expenditures as of March 31, 2017.


	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	 




	We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	(a) Management’s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.






	 




	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 




	 




	14







	 






	Table of Contents






	 


	With respect to the period ending March 31, 2017, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	Based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending March 31, 2017, the Company’s management, including its Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and management was dominated by one individual during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, and now is dominated by two individuals who are employees of Oncolix, without adequate compensating controls. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.


	 


	The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, the Company’s management, including its Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.


	  




	(b) Changes in Internal Controls.






	 




	There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. Subsequent to March 31, 2017, Oncolix acquired a majority interest in the Company and two Oncolix employees were elected as the sole Directors and Officers. The new management has been responsible for this quarterly report.


	 


	For a full discussion of controls and procedures refer to Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

	Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds




	 


	During the period ending March 31, 2016, the Company engaged in the sale of its unregistered securities as described below. The shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance of shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(a)(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, these shareholders had necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(a)(2) since they agreed to receive shares certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” All shareholders are “sophisticated investors” and are family members, friends or business acquaintances of our officers and directors. Based on an analysis of the above factors, we believe we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction.




	 


	On March 1, 2017, the Company issued 60,000,000 shares of common stock to New Opportunity Business Solutions, Inc., a wholly owned affiliate of Brian Kistler, the sole officer and director of the Company, in exchange for the agreement to extinguish the liabilities and financial obligations of the Company, including $266,010 of indebtedness of the Company and any amounts that would be payable to Mr. Kistler or his affiliate for personal services rendered to AEPP.

Market Release — Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers





























































NEWS






New Wealth From High-Tech Oil ProductionRadically Simplifying Technologies Better Align Oil Recovery With Nature Introducing Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers Inc. (OTCQB: AEPP) -- a petroleum developer with new technologies and an exciting vision to slash the financial cost – and the environmental consequences – of very substantial petroleum production. Includes extraordinary earnings and gains potential for shareholders. AEPP’s licensed technologies from PointSource Processing Inc. revolutionize oil recovery from shale by:Pulverizing oil-rich rock against itself using high-speed air flows.Using a one-step liquid catalyst to recover the oil from the resultant sized rock.Reinstating the cleaned rock back where it originated – eliminating all tailings and tailings- Pond costs.Soon, using proprietary low-temperature cracking to break down complex low-grade oil molecules into very high-value, high-demand, high-margin, jet-fuel-grade and above hydrocarbons. AEPP is a petroleum exploration and development company, which controls the Technical Evaluation Agreement (TEA) from PeruPetro S.A., Peru’s controlling state agency, to evaluate and potentially develop and produce Oil & Gas from Block 19 in southern Peru. Block 19 consists of a 10,100 square kilometers oil and gas lease holding minimally 745 square kilometers of on-surface shale oil based on 2D seismic geophysical surveys performed by leading Peruvian petroleum engineers. We have identified phase 2 with 150 square Kilometers to the East. These very large, accessible resources are now being further evaluated and defined into qualified reserves by respected Chapman Petroleum Engineering of Calgary. Concurrently, AEPP has entered into an exclusive technology contract with PointSource Processing Inc. (PSP) of Victoria, B.C., for the extraction and upgrading of shale oil. PSP has completed 5 years of testing of the on-surface shale formations, and is providing three phases of radically new recovery technologies with exceptional promise for low-cost, environmentally sound procedures for exploitation of the oil-rich shale’s. Technology Phases 1, 2 and 3 AEPP is building a mobile processing plant specifically engineered for the oil shale of Block 19, which will demonstrate the application of Phases 1 and 2 technologies for the recovery of oil from shale. Phase #1:Phase #1's technology is known as Air Fractionation. Here the shale is pulverized against itself into pebble-size particles for the extraction of the petroleum.The process involves feeding the shale rock into a high-speed (~220 mph) airflow. The large shale-filled container causing the shale pieces to pulverize against each other at a combined speed of 440mph.This process replaces the current capital-intensive, 3-step crushing and milling process known to tar sands producers and most mining operations. The technology uses a single, very low-energy output with operating expenses that are one-tenth that of conventional processes, and capital expenditures that are a tiny fraction of the mass crushing, cone crushing and milling known throughout the industry. Air fractionation is already being applied today in several industries for several cost-saving and environment-saving objectives. What is new is that AEPP’s mobile plant is anticipated to be the first demonstration of the process for petroleum recovery. Phase #2: The pebble-sized pieces from Phase 1 are loaded into a rotating drum and sprayed with a proprietary liquid catalyst, which draws essentially all hydrocarbons from the shale pebbles, effectively separating oil from shale. The oil/catalyst liquid is drawn off and the catalyst, after light heating to separate the catalyst from the hydrocarbons, is recycled and used again in a closed loop cycle. The cleaned pebbles are separated for reinstatement in the ground. There are no tailings, no tailings pond, no poisons, and no tailings spills or possible tailings liability – an additional large savings. At this point, the hydrocarbons are bitumen with some light volatiles, API’s ranging from 20API to approx. 25API, with very low sulfur, approximately 0.1-0.3%, and ready for sale to market at prices in the range of US$40/barrel with the simplified oil recovery having cost in the range of approximately US$22 - $24/bbl. A substantial gross profit margin. Approximately two tons of shale from Block 19 is known to generate on average 1 barrel of bitumen. ‘API’ refers to the grade and cost of any hydrocarbon as measured by the American Petroleum Institute. West Texas sweet crude oil, the most quoted grade of oil, is 40API. Phase #3: The third technology, a proprietary low temperature Cracking, breaks down the complex bitumen molecules produced from Phase 2 into lighter forms of hydrocarbons changing them into gaseous Acetylene, Ethylene and molecular hydrogen dissolved in Pentane (API 95), Hexane (API 84) and Octane (API 93). This one-step process converts low-grade oil into high-grade oils along the lines of jet fuel and lighter. These gases dissolve in the liquids, changing the specific gravity into a highly valuable hydrocarbon mix marketable in the range of approx. $300/bbl. at an all-in cost in the range of approximately $120/bbl. The low temperature-cracking module has no moving part and is designed to operate 24/7/365 for approx. 3 years before replacement. Procedurally, the phase 1 and 2 pilot plant can be constructed for approx. US$7.2 million. The initial levels of defining reserves at Block 19 are targeted to cost US$2 million. The company is targeting initial production of low-grade bitumen from the Phase 1 and 2 mobile plant in the range of 8 - 12 months.Phase 3-technology application is two-plus years from readiness at a cost of approx. US$25 million. Profits from the sale of bitumen are anticipated to cover the majority of the capital expenditure for Phase 3 production. Management, Directors Loong Yip Juy (Vincent), President Mr. Loong, age 66, was born in Guangzhou China and is a resident of Peru. He is a graduate of the National Engineering University of Peru where he has served in business management throughout his career. Andrew Mynheer, Director Mr. Mynheer, age 55, was born in Oxford UK and is a resident of British Columbia. He is a graduate of Brookes University in Oxford and has a distinguished career as a steady manager bringing complex designs through to operating fruition. Outlook With the successful application of Phases 1 and 2, AEPP is anticipated to be a stable, operating petroleum producer with an enviable profit margin and a world-class environmental record. Trading today at 50 cents/share, the potential value to shareholders could be breathtaking. With ascendance to Phase 3, and the sale of premium oils at an enviable profit margin, AEPP could well become a leading intermediate-sized producer.Corporate Information  Exchange/symbol: (OTCQB: AEPP) Recent price range shares outstanding shares in float contact $0.50/share 93 million 11 million www.aeppinc.com  Contact Nigel Bosworth for all Investor Relations information.Nigel Bosworth - Investor Relationsnigel.bosworth@aeppinc.com+1-250-885-0545
