Introducing ACTABOND™ Topical Skin Adhesive, the first medical adhesive to utilize the Dilinynx™ technology, a proprietary formulation designed to provide superior strength and fast, gentle drying without damaging skin tissue or causing discomfort to patients.
Click N Go Design
ACTABOND™ was designed with surgeons in mind. Superior ergonomics with the functionality of a pen provide hassle-free activation and intuitive control. No glass, No problem. ACTABOND™ eliminates the risks of glass shard penetration or clogging with its patented glassless design.
Why Actabond?


Simple Click N Go activation
Familiar ergonomic pen design for greater control
No glass shards to prevent flow or limit the amount of adhesive that can be expressed
Minimal heat generated during adhesive polymerization eliminating patient discomfort

Better Performance, Better Value

Closing wounds with ACTABOND™ gives surgeons and patients the confidence of strong protective closure while providing excellent cosmetic outcomes. *

Thank you Wesley, you have made me a loyal customer.  I hope I do not need the higher compression, but when the day comes, be assured, I will seek you and the Compression Store out.It was also very nice to feel a real, sympathetic human on the other end of the phone.Keep up the good work and good will!

Superb! I have purchased from them before and will continue to do so. Their site is easy to navigate; their prices are very competitive; and their shipping was as close to immediate, as you will find anywhere (on-line or otherwise). I was also impressed with the speed and comprehensiveness of their electronic confirmation, both to my order and when my order was shipped. Compressionstore.com puts the squeeze on everyone . . . good for the customer; not so good for their competitors. Can I have my dollar now? :)

I ordered my socks on Friday, and Monday was Columbus Day, with no mail delivery. I was amazed that on Tuesday morning, I had my compression socks in my hand. Wow!  That's same day service. If not for the Holiday, I am sure I would have recieved my products on Monday. Brilliant.
