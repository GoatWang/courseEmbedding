Aerospace and defense: Investment opportunities are on the radar
A potential increase in defense spending and an uptick in commercial aircraft orders could boost the industry’s prospects

  Posted    by  Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist      on  Mar 8, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 
The defense industry has been a strong performer since the Nov. 8 US elections. Between Nov. 8, 2016, and Feb. 24, 2017, the SPADE Defense Index has rallied 14.54% — outpacing the S&P 500 Index by more than 3%.1 Given the scale of the Trump administration’s proposed defense budget, as well as positive trends in commercial airline orders, I believe prospects are favorable for aerospace and defense firms.
US aerospace and defense orders are rising
After showing flat to declining growth since 2010, US defense orders — which include aircraft, related parts and other military hardware produced by the Department of Defense — have been trending upward and are now approaching 2010 highs as a result of revitalized defense spending that began under President Obama and looks to increase even more under President Trump. The president’s recently unveiled budget proposal calls for a 10% ($54 billion) increase in military spending, which is likely to be well-received by many members of the GOP-led Congress.
Non-defense aircraft orders have seen similar patterns. After a choppy few years, six-month average aircraft order volume tailed off through the first half of 2016, but has advanced since then. These trends can be seen in the chart below.
Source: Bloomberg L.P., as of Feb. 27, 2017
Commercial airline orders could bode well for profits
Non-defense aircraft orders are important, as defense contractors such as Boeing, United Technologies and Honeywell profit by selling goods and services to commercial aviation firms. (As of Feb. 28, 2017, these companies represented 7.52%, 6.70% and 7.00%, respectively, of the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio.)
In its January earnings call, Boeing executives indicated that they view aviation as a long-term growth industry, and that Boeing is seeing healthy passenger traffic and a modestly improving air cargo market — conditions that are constructive for aircraft production.2 If aircraft manufacturers manage order volume efficiently, the upward trend in commercial aircraft demand could flow through to the bottom line in the form of healthy profit growth.
Global defense spending could rise as well
The Trump administration has suggested that European member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should contribute more to defense spending. The chart below shows what NATO members currently contribute as a percentage of gross domestic product. In my view, it would not be surprising to see an uptick in some of these numbers as a direct result of pressure from the US.
Source: North Atlantic Treaty Organization as of July 2016
Outside of NATO, Saudi Arabia is expected to boost its defense budget by 6.6% in 2017, according to defense data provider IHS Jane’s.3 And Reuters recently highlighted high levels of defense spending in the Gulf States of the Middle East — despite weak oil prices.4
­­Defense budgets are increasing in Asia as well. In December 2016, IHS Jane’s projected continued growth in China’s defense spending, with total outlays expected to reach $233 billion by 2020 — up from $123 billion in 2010.3
What does this mean for investors?
The prospect of increased US and global defense spending, overlaid with positive trends in commercial aircraft, creates a backdrop that could be favorable for aerospace and defense firms. I believe that now may be the right time to give these companies a closer look.
Investors interested in the aerospace and defense industries may wish to consider the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA).

PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio risks
There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The fund’s return may not match the return of the underlying index. The fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the fund.
Investments focused in a particular industry, such as aerospace and defense, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments.
Stocks of small and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale.
The fund is nondiversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment.

Weekly Market Review: Are emotions overriding facts?
In the US and Europe, sentiment doesn’t seem to match current realities

  Posted    by  Kristina Hooper, Global Market Strategist      on  Jul 24, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
Global stocks moved higher last week, driven by a US stock market that continued to advance despite a plethora of negative headlines and a growing likelihood that President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda will not come to fruition in 2017. In addition, US stock market volatility, as measured by the VIX Index, remains very low. It’s almost as if US stocks have a Teflon-like coating around them, shielding them from the brunt of negative news. But why?

Are smart beta ETFs skewing stock valuations?
An analysis of ownership data suggests that ETFs are not the market disrupters they’re portrayed to be

  Posted    by  Eric Pollackov, Global Head of ETF Capital Markets      on  Jul 20, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 
Thanks in large part to the popularity of smart beta and factor-based strategies, adoption of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has grown rapidly in recent years. Some have even speculated that the growth of ETFs is skewing the valuations of certain stocks. I do not believe that is the case. Below, I explain why.
Is the popularity of ETFs affecting single-stock ownership?

Factoring a gap year into college savings
Can 529 funds be used for gap-year expenses?

  Posted    by  Tom Rowley, Director, Retirement and Education Strategies      on  Jul 19, 2017,      in  Feature, Retirement 
I recently had a parent ask me if their child’s 529 college savings account money could be used to help pay for gap-year expenses. Here’s the short answer: Maybe.
If you’re hoping to use your child’s 529 account to pay for travel, extracurricular activities, insurance or medical expenses, the answer is no. If you’re hoping to pay for tuition and fees, books and other qualified educational expenses, then the answer is maybe. Let’s take a closer look at this relatively new option for high school graduates and how a 529 account might play a role.

Weekly Market Review: The global forces of disruption
Disruption of many kinds has been a common theme in 2017

  Posted    by  Kristina Hooper, Global Market Strategist      on  Jul 17, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
One of the key themes I’ve identified for 2017 and beyond is global disruption. Disruption can take many forms and be either a positive or negative force. The economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that disruption could be a positive force for economies — hence the term, “creative destruction.” Disruption — both positive and negative, both geopolitical and monetary — is abundant across the globe right now.

Why fiduciaries may want to consider fixed income
Investment clarity can help further the advisor-investor conversation

  Posted    by  Jack Tierney, Head of UIT Investment Policy and Governance      on  Jul 14, 2017,      in  Feature, Investing Essentials 
The US Marine Corps motto is “Semper Fidelis” or “Semper Fi” for short, meaning “always faithful.” Another related Latin word, “fidere,” means “to trust.” From this root also comes the word “fiduciary,” which refers to acting in a capacity of trust or confidence. While “faith” and “trust” are staples of love songs and wedding vows, “fiduciary” clearly denotes a financial relationship — and this summer, many of you may be embarking on new fiduciary relationships.

Which factors topped the list in the second quarter of 2017?
Growth and momentum strategies continue their comeback stories

  Posted    by  Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist      on  Jul 13, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 

Growth and momentum again topped factor performance in the second quarter of 2017, with smaller-cap versions of both factors outpacing their large-cap counterparts. Growth stocks were in such favor during the quarter that the Russell 2000 Pure Growth Index and Russell MidCap Pure Growth Index were the two best performers, despite the fact that small- and mid-cap stocks as a whole lagged the broader market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index.
Factor leadership can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on market conditions and economic trends. Growth began its comeback in the first quarter of 2017 as the outlook for robust fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, faded. The small- and mid-cap value, dividend and high beta factors lagged during this time — weighed down by weakness in commodity prices and diminishing growth prospects.
More factors outperformed the broad market this quarter, with 12 factor indexes outpacing
