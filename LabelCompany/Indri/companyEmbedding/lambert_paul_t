BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Lambert & Lambert, Inc. has received 4.67 out of 5 stars based on 8 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Lambert & Lambert mislead me in submitting my invention. I mail them $199 for my inventions and they said it was for an evaluation process. They send my report back and said that my invention did not pass the score had to be 96 and I got a 84. They also send me additional information to other companies that I had to pay any where from $500 to $1000 to get my invention produce. They did not tell me that upfront. They states that they will spend they money to get your invention produced. I have been requesting a refund and now they got my money and will not response back to me. They website sound very convincing. I saw on RipOff website they are scammers. PLease help me to get my money back. Thanks Barbara

The fact that they turned your idea away because it didn't score high enough seems like they aren't running a scam. if it was a scam wouldn't they accept every idea because weither or not it had any potential to become an actual product wouldn't matter. if it was a scam they'd accept every idea because they're making money off of you and not off of the idea. Since your invention scored too low why would you be interested in paying more money to them to push your idea?

It seems to me that Lambert & Lambert Invent is a good company. They have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and are professional members of the United Inventors Association. Also, you can find reviews from inventors at:

Lambert & Lambert Inventions is a Rip-Off. They are in business of scamming people out of there $199 upfront fee and are partnering with other companies to take your money after they give your invention a 86 in the end. Stay away!!

Their website states very plainly that the fee is for evaluation only, and they don't promise to take every invention submitted to them. You got what you paid for, which was a report. Come up with another idea, or use that report to help write a business plan to get funding to build the company yourself. Although, based on your grammar and spelling I would hire someone else to write that business plan.

My name is Trevor Lambert and I am the President and founder of Lambert & Lambert, Inc. Unfortunately, since we signed a Nondisclosure/Confidentiality Agreement with "Barbara" when she submitted, I can not speak on the specific merits of her invention - which admittedly poses a challenge when dealing with her complaint in this public forum. Nevertheless, let me just say that any neutral party who reviewed her invention when looking over our market research would see that the product lacked commercial feasibility.

Clearly she misunderstood our process for whatever reason, which led to this complaint. Reading our website anyone can see that we represent inventors on contingency only after we perform an evaluation that focuses on the "licensability" of the invention. Our research consists of competitive analysis on existing products in the marketplace, a patent search and 16 other criteria key to a successful product. Yes, that evaluation has a fee of $199, yet considering a patent search alone usually costs $500+ with most service providers, I think you will see the value and understand we are not getting rich off of evaluations. Rather, our evaluation process provides a system by which we can consider new products for representation utilizing scientific methodology.

Further, I would like to assure the visitors to this site that our company continues to represent inventors and successfully license inventions on their behalf. Should you need reassurance on the legitimacy of our company (which has been in business nearly a decade) let me just site the following about our company:

- Member of the Better Business Bureau with an A+ rating
- Professional Member of the United Inventors Association
- Official Good Guy by the National Inventor Fraud Center
- Member of the Minnesota Inventors Congress

Finally, I personally am a member of the Licensing Executives Society, I speak at inventor organizations (such as the Inventors Network), I completed a book (Invent Secrets) and have had articles published - most recently one was published in the Inventors Digest, and just this month I was elected to the Board of Directors for the United Inventors Association.

If this doesn't convince you that we are a legitimate company, I invite you to call us and speak with some of my staff or visit our offices for a face-to-face meeting. I understand that this industry is filled with sharks, yet I assure you we are not one of them.

In the end we continue to have a nominal fee for the evaluation and work on contingency thereafter instead of charging inventors $10, 000-20, 000 like our competitors. Yes, we turn down inventions that we feel won't be successful, but I would rather remain honest and tell inventors what I really think about their invention, rather than fill them with hope to get them to spend thousands on their invention.

All my best, Trevor

I recently sent my idea to Lambert & Lambert and so far they seem to be nothing but complete profesionals. I understand they need to evaluate my product and make a decision on weather its marketable. All ideas are not good ideas. Why wouldnt they jump on idea if its o good one? It would be more profit for them. If you dont like there response go another direction, try & prove them wrong. Sour grapes taste awful.Try, try again.

I am thinking about submitting my idea to Lambert and Lambert. To me my idea is the
 best thing that has been thought of since the wheel. I want to let you all know one thing
the excitement and energy that this idea gives me is just as important to me as getting it to market and seing it on shelves at the sporting goods store. However I know that it is
what it is just an idea. Like all ideas some are good some not so good. Every inventor that
has ever thought of a product has thought the same thing- this is going to be a glod mine-
This my friends is not the case I would estimate that 1 in 3000 ideas become a reality.
Knowing the latter I still have confidance in my product so if I lose $200 because the evaluation system they use says my product is not good enough then they saved me alot of money other companies out there would have stolen. One such company I contacted wanted $898 for the same thing Lambert and Lambert is going to do for $2oo
SUGESTION: Donot be so blinded by your idea and see it for what it is just an idea, your puppy and we all want our puppies to grow int dogs but reality tells us that dont always happen. If your idea did not work for you I will sell you mine for 30 grand.

I am glad Lambert responded. I was just reading the 8 paragraph contract or as they call it "Legal Disclosure and Information" I received from Patent Assistance Worldwide which shares a page with a box for your credit card information so that I can pay the $1, 279.oo they are going to charge me for what works out to be their opinion. However the BBB has given them a B-. Even if I didn't think they were scammers, which i do, I would definitely rather pay $200 than the former. And because I am on an extremely limited budget right now I'm still going to shop around and take my time to make sure my invention makes it to the next round. I'd like to see one of those rejection reports, it seems like that would be a valuable tool in this process. Better luck next time Barb.

I decided to go forward with Patent Assistance Worldwide. I received a full patent search with an attached leagal opinion from a registered patent attorney, a great market analysis covering 33 factors that may affect my idea and a very detailed graphic illustration of my idea. All this was put in a Produt Guide that outlined everything about my idea. GOOD WORK! Very happy, the same attorney filed a patten application for me and was very good at explaining the process to me in detail. I have an offer for my idea, but I want to wait for Global Licensing Partners to find me a better one.

Seems you didn't really use this company, they are great!!

I have been dealing with other promotion companies you propably guess who and have to be fair to lambert and lambert they are much cheaper and saw some of their reports compared to other companies are far better, we also have to be fair that some inventions are totally useless and have no market but lambert and lambert from the above info seems to reject to go any further and suck money from people unlike other companies who they are aware the product is useless and yet they charge people extortionate amont of hard earned money.

I've been working with Patent Assistance Worldwide and my invention/idea passed their review board...they seem reputable to me, though they do have a B- with the BBB, I've spoken with IP Watchdog and they know nothing negative at least about them. The FTC and the Attorney General's office in Miami FL doesn't seem to have any complaints with them and they work on a contingency fee basis that is more than fair to the inventor. So I'll let you know how it turns out, they want my invention ready for the June Tradeshow here in Las Vegas, it's at the Mandalay Bay Casino and it's called the Licensee Tradeshow if I remember right...good luck to all inventors and check out Gene Quinn and IP Watchdog, it's a great site to learn from for sure...

I'm wondering how it went with working with Patent Assistance Worldwide. I'm also pursuing an idea with them right now. I have already paid the up front $1200 for all the info. They are just waiting for me to pay the next almost $6000 and they will go ahead and pass me on to Global Licensing Partners to help me sell my idea. Please help me know if they are just a scam. I can't afford to throw money away!

If you got a slightly more technical invention, forget these guys. They seem to be only able to handle simple gadgets used for infomercials to be perfectly blunt. Just look at the success stories and you be the judge.

best thing now a days is if you have invented something small and not so complicated you can find yourself someone to draw it for you in 3D cad then use 3d printer to produce your prototype then submit your patent documents and take it to china and produce in large quantity, hope this helps could save people a small fortune, please let me know if you find this useful, thanks

Is it true that Patent Assistance Worldwide does not charge an consultant fee for reviewing your invention? Because i would not want to send something to them and then get caught I rather do that with Lambert&lambert since they are much more recognised and acredited.
By the way New inventer i like your idea very much, but sadly to date i dont have the funds to go that route so i still have to look for investors.

Awaiting your response.

										I submitted my invention to L&L in January, it is now August and I
have yet to receive any evaluations or any other type of paperwork to
date! I am always told they sent it but would resend it. How many times
do you think it would take for them to get it right? After many
apologies for months now, I Still actually wait for what they promised
in the mail! Due to their continuing errors and lack of response I was
allowed to submit another idea free of charge. Now don't you think it's
ridiculous for anyone to be treated as such?? Especially for a company
that supposedly has good reviews. Well that's all about to change. I
believe I have been lied to tremendously and am not going to put up
with it anymore! Many conversations and False promises. Don't believe
all those testimonials either. Other companies can at least back up
theirs with Real people. Now Trevor should know from experience how it
feels to have one's livelihood messed with or taken for the biggest BS
ride of their life! Shame on you! I don't know how you even sleep
nights! I am getting better response elsewhere and frankly don't think
L&L deserve up to 30% of my royalties since they are anything but
professional. I don't care if Trevor goes to trade shows etc...maybe go
back to school if you can't deal with anything more technical than a
simple gadget. If you can't handle it then ADMIT it! That's a word from
the wise. Don't make people believe you're something you're not. BTW,
the supposed evaluation of at least the first invention was positive
and passed. The second one has been in their hands now for about 2
months. Frankly, I don't trust it in their hands and will now be
demanding not only a refund but will be seeking other avenues with
these guys. I think 8 months of emotional distress is bad enough but
now they can't even do alone what they had promised on their website.
For instance you now would pay an additional $200 for special designs
on a program called Enhance, something of which they said they do!
Hmmmmm, I smell a rat here. Or how about a website through them which
is another small fee. Now I realize that might still be reasonable but
when it goes from doing it all to now recruiting other companies to
help, it only means to me you were never really qualified to begin
with. The BBB will get a detailed report from me also. This will also
be posted wherever possible including fB to help others. Follow up
information will also be posted. In closing, although I don't think
I've said enough, I have been very, very patient with these guys and
always treated them respectfully until just recently. The breaking
point was after 11 days following our last conversation, I still have
not received what they yet AGAIN said they sent! This was to be the
review I Never received and paperwork to be signed! Now I think I've
been patient enough, don't you???? 8 MONTHS OF LIES AND BS! I guess I
have learned to be careful who you trust - that is what I did wrong.

										 1Author 1Consumer 2Employee/Owner    Updates & Rebuttals     #1 REBUTTAL Owner of company  Representing Inventors AUTHOR: Trevor Lambert -  (United States of America) SUBMITTED: Sunday, November 11, 2012 POSTED: Sunday, November 11, 2012  
														Dear Sir or Madam, 
My name is Trevor Lambert and I am the President of Lambert & Lambert, Inc.  As is shown in the thread on this complaint, it has been retracted by the person who posted it since we never performed an evaluation for the inventor. 
As for the allegation that we do not accept inventions for license representation and only supply negative reports, that is patently false.  In fact, we are always proactively representing inventors and licensing products on their behalf.  Just in the past couple months we have several new items hitting Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond and Lowes; one of which is an infomercial product. 
In the end, web communication is very impersonal and so I would encourage you to give us a call or, better yet, visit our office to meet our staff.  We hope to hear from you. 
All my best,
Trevor

														If you want to waste $200 and you time go ahead and submit your invention.  Look at other customers, L&L always gives a rating below their standard to invest your product.  Look at how many people that they supposedly helped.  Don't do it and I say this because I care.  They get hundreds of inventions a day at $200 bucks a pop to send an email that says you didn't make the cut.

Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #3 REBUTTAL Owner of company  Inventor Fabricated Complaint AUTHOR: Trevor Lambert -  (United States of America) SUBMITTED: Monday, February 21, 2011 POSTED: Monday, February 21, 2011  
														I would like to notify those who read this post that I have contacted "Jpaul6281" directly with the email below. Since I respect that he would like to remain anonymous to those reading, I've deleted anything that would reveal his identity.  
As the saying goes, "Sunlight is the best disinfectant"...and in that spirit (and since he has chosen to make this very public), my hope is to provide complete transparency regarding this complaint and let the reader decide for themselves.  
Dear [Inventors Name],  
As you know, I've replied to your complaint posted at: [website address] After extensive research into all of our submissions since January, all that we have record of is that you were sent the signed Nondisclosure Agreements and Submission Forms on January 21, 2010. Thus far we have no record of a formal submission in which a payment was made on your behalf for an evaluation. I've taken the liberty of researching you and I came across your published patent application (20xx/0xxxxxxx) for a [description of invention], yet nothing correlates with a formal submission to Lambert & Lambert.  
Further, in speaking with my staff that handles phone calls and emails, they have no record of any communication from you prior to your complaint postings throughout the Internet. In all my business dealings I try to give the benefit of the doubt to the inventor and seek to rectify amicably anything that may be construed as a mistake on our part, however at this point I'm struggling to see any fault on our behalf.  
To put this matter to rest I am going to need a response from you to prove that your invention was submitted with payment to our firm or your acknowledgment that this was a mistake on your behalf. Should I not receive this information from you by the end of this week I will need to consider other options.  
Regards, 
Trevor
