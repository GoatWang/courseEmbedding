Featured Parts




World-Leading Manufacturer of ATV and UTV Parts

		When you're competing on the national motocross circuit and are having difficulty getting your hands on the kinds of top-quality parts you need to adequately upgrade your machine's performance, what can you do? Well, if you're anything like the owners of Houser Racing, you simply start to make your own parts! That's how it started for us back in the late 90s when our main objective was to do what we needed to do to make it into the winner's circle.
	

		That led to our being asked to produce some of our high-quality parts for a side retailer at the track, which we did. This was the beginning of our new company, Houser Racing, purveyor of top-quality ATV parts and accessories. We have since become a respected, top-name aftermarket ATV parts manufacturer that provides the highest quality performance parts to customers worldwide. We've also branched out into aftermarket UTV performance parts and have created a strong following among those looking for that extra edge when competing.
	

		If you're running a Honda, Kawasaki, KTM, Suzuki or Yamaha ATV, we make performance parts specific to your ride, plus several universal parts designed to fit them all, such as kill switches, brake line clamps, handle bar clamps, brake lines and more. You'll also find a nice selection of Polaris 900 and 1000 UTV and side-by-side equipment as well as a subcategory dedicated to the Yamaha YXZ 1000R. If you’re searching for quality, you’ve found it.

Custom-Engineered Parts for Polaris RZR XP 1000
Our selection of Polaris RZR XP 1000 parts has helped make us the prime Polaris XP parts manufacturer for Polaris UTV riders worldwide. Several of the items, such as the Maximum Protection Front and Rear Bumpers and Razor Roll Cage, are what we consider Polaris RZR reinforcement equipment. These are designed to make your machine stronger, tougher and less likely to become damaged while you're busily driving balls to the wall.
The Sport Edition Front Bumper is the strongest and most popular front bumper sold for the RZR XP 1000, adding both function and style. Handmade in the U.S., it's TIG welded (tungsten inert gas) for strength and dent resistance. Other high-quality protective devices for the Polaris include a Front Bumper Skid Plate, Front Bumper Tie-ins and Rear Lower MGC Radius Rods, which are designed to add all-important maximum ground clearance. Check out the tree bars – these protect both you and your UTV.

Houser John D



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Iowa:













Does Houser John D carry a valid contracting license?



Although a contractor license is not required in the state of Iowa, contractors earning more than $2000 per year from construction related work must register their business with the Iowa Division of Labor.











How important is contractor licensing in Iowa?



In Iowa, general contractors are not required to pass an exam to become licensed. However, plumbing and electrical contractors do have to pass a trade exam to obtain a license in Iowa.











Your liability risk when hiring Houser John D



Registered contractors in Iowa are required to carry an active workers' compensation policy. In addition to workers' compensation insurance, it is always a good idea to hire contractors with general liability insurance. Be sure to request copies of certificates for both workers' compensation and general liabilty insurance 











Financial recourse when hiring Houser John D



Iowa contractors are required to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file a claim against this bond in the event of faulty work or damaged property. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Iowa, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
