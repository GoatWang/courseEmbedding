Here Are The Key Points From The Most Recent U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ:USAU) Presentation

InvestingBasic MaterialsBreaking News Jul 20, 2017 0 465 












At the end of last week (at session close on July 13, 2017), U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ:USAU) management hosted a live webinar. Hosted by the company's President and CEO, Edward Karr, the webinar was set up to outline a number of key recent developments and to discuss how these developments play into US Gold Corp's strategy going forward.

Since the webinar took place, the company's share price is up close to 20%. This suggests market interpretation of US Gold Corp's recent activity, coupled with management's plans to leverage recent notable operational advances, is positive and indicative of further upside strength as the company matures along its strategic development pathway.
With this in mind, here's a look at the highlights of the webinar and why the company is gaining strength on the back of its release.



(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

A quick introduction to the company
For those new to this company, US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) is a Nevada based mining and exploration company. It's got two primary projects in its roster as things stand, Keystone and Copper King, both of which we will get to in a little more detail shortly. Management consists of the above-noted Karr, an investment banker who sits on the Board of Directors at numerous natural resource companies in the US and internationally; Head of Exploration Dave Mathewson, who most recently discovered and developed a number of producing resources at Gold Standard Ventures Corp (GSV) and who previously headed up the development of some of Nevada's biggest deposits in his role at Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM); and Operations Manager Neil Whitmer, who also worked with Mathewson at Gold Standard Ventures and has a background in law and land acquisition.
The presentation – an introduction and a takeaway
It kicked off with a top down look at the two primary assets, the above-noted Keystone and Copper King. Included in the Keystone section was a second property called Gold Bar North (GBN), which is – again – something that we'll zoom in on in a little more detail later on in this discussion.
For now, it's enough to say that Keystone is a gold mining project located along the Cortez trend in Nevada, which is a trend that has repeatedly proven its worth as a viable production region for some of the biggest names in the sector – Barrick, Newmont and more – all of which are currently mining deposits that are producing in excess of a million ounces of gold annually.
The Copper King project is located in Wyoming (very close to the Nevada border, but Wyoming nonetheless) and is a far more advanced property in terms of development than its Keystone counterpart. It's a copper mine, which isn’t surprising given its name, and it's already got a completed Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in place.
The key takeaway from these early introductions to the projects is that the company is diversified across two stages of development – one being an early stage blue sky type project that is likely going to account for the vast majority of forward valuation and the other a more run of the mill project, but one that is far more advanced along its development pathway and has the potential to provide bread and butter type revenues for the company as it pushed for the blockbuster return on its Keystone project.
In other words, one project to provide long term high-level returns, a second to provide lower, but steady revenues to help fund the former.
The projects in detail – Keystone 
Moving on, the presentation then looked at these two projects in a little more detail and injected some numbers into the equation.
First up, Keystone.
The company noted that the project resides well within what is generally regarded as the Nevada Elephant County, within a large mining and processing infrastructure that includes numerous >20-million-ounce gold deposits. This, of course, far from guarantees Keystone this degree of a resource count but it does serve to strengthen the chances of the company uncovering rich mineralization based on the geographical proximity (and, in turn, the geological similarities) between Keystone and its surrounding deposits. So of the more notable of these are Cortez Hills, Battle Creek, Railroad, Pinion and Gold Bar (note: not the Gold Bar North referenced above).
Keystone – geology 
Looking at the geology, the project is what's called a tertiary, intrusive centered dome formation, with a permissive carbonate lower-plate window. As noted, this geology has strong similarities to some of the surrounding deposits and a key near term strategy for Keystone and its exploration team is demonstrating that this similarity can translate to mineable mineralization.
Keystone – exploration 
There has never been systematic modern-day, model-driven exploration undertaken at the location and US Gold Corp is currently making strides towards fixing this shortfall. The company has just completed a district-wide, 2800 station, detailed gravity survey and the interpretation of this study is going to inform the exploratory program as it moves forward.
So the exploration programs at the site have been limited to date, but what can these limited programs reveal about Keystone's potential?
Keystone – the data
A look at the limited historical data reveals that High grade and thick intercepts of gold have been encountered in what has generally amounted to very shallow historical drilling. The image below is a snapshot from the presentation, detailing some of the locations and grades within the project:
source
And here's a quote from Mathewson (the above mentioned Head of Exploration who spearheaded Elephant-sized discoveries in this very trend while at Newmont):
"(Keystone is) … The best exploration project I have seen in my career… reminds me of the Railroad project on steroids"
For reference, Railroad is one of the now producing deposits he worked to explore and develop through to production while at Gold Standard Ventures.
As far as exploration progress is concerned, the company has completed five scout drill holes and intends to drill a couple more before the end of this year. There's also plans to drill three exploratory holes within a close proximity to one of the scout holes (a hole called KEY16-03c) during 2017.
Gold Bar North
Touching briefly on the Gold Bar North deposit, then, this is an extension of the Keystone district to the South that was recently acquired and adds 49 lode claims to the total district-wide claim count. It's geologically similar to the Gold Bar deposit that McEwen Mining Inc. (MUX) is about to start mining (which, in turn, lies just south of Gold Bar North) and looks like a promising addition to the company's claims in the region. It seems to be a shallower opportunity than the primary deposits at Keystone, meaning it may be a more economical program from cost perspective longer term.
Just as is the case with Keystone, the company plans to conduct some exploratory drill target identification at the project throughout 2017 and then move onto a drilling program designed to establish resource estimate.
The projects in detail – Copper King
So that's Keystone. Let's move on to Copper King.
This one, as alluded to earlier, is a development stage gold and copper and gold project located in southeast Wyoming, 20 miles west of Cheyenne. It has shown considerable promise on the back of a range of historic programs and, since 1938, at least nine historic drilling campaigns by seven companies plus the U.S. Bureau of Mines have been conducted, with drilling by five different operators since 1970 confirming said mineralization. It's also located entirely on state land making the process of picking up permitting for future production far cheaper and easier than it otherwise might be.
Copper King – PEA
From the PEA that's already been conducted, we've got a far more detailed idea of what this deposit holds in terms of copper and gold resources than we do for gold at the Keystone project. The base case for the resource suggests a 17 year projected mine life, with around 34,000 ounces' gold per year and 8.8 million lbs. copper per year. Based on a $104 million CAPEX requirement and a $273 million net cash flow (and assuming gold prices at $1,100 and copper at $3.00), pointing to a net present value of $159.5 million (at a 5% discount rate).
The forward plan for this one is rooted in the bringing of the PEA up to date and then, once the updated estimates are in place, the on-boarding of a team that can carry the project forward while Mathewson and his team focus on Keystone and GBN.
That just about sums up the operational side of the presentation and brings readers up to date with the company, its projects, and its forward strategy as far as the advancing of these projects towards production is concerned.
Some company metrics
US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) completed an $11.92 million equity offering back in October last year and – subsequent to this offering – had cash on hand of a little over $7.58 million at January 31, 2017. This cash means the company is fully funded from an exploration perspective throughout 2017, removing any near term dilution risk.
At last count, US Gold Corp traded for a market capitalization was $29.2 million based on a share price of $2.65.

									U.S. Gold Corp. (USAU): An intriguing and undervalued explorer with a near term growth strategy								

									Wednesday, Jul 19, 2017								

Written by Samuel RaeBack in May, I published this piece detailing the untapped potential in the Cortez Trend. The trend has long played second fiddle to the Carlin Trend in the Nevada gold mining space but, across the last decade, a number of major discoveries in the region have highlighted it as potentially being as mineral rich, or even more so, than its more established counterpart. As indicative of this potential, I highlighted a junior gold miner called U.S. Gold Corp. (USAU). At the time, the company had just been acquired by a US tech company and there existed some promising, but somewhat limited, data as to its flagship development project; a project called Keystone, located along the Cortez Trend. Over the last two months, US Gold Corp has published a large amount of additional information concerning the Keystone project and – on the back of the added detail – is starting to attract a considerable amount of attention in the market. Here's a look at what we now know about US Gold Corp and an analysis of how the new information has the potential to impact valuation going forward. First, a quick introduction to the company.US Gold Corp is a Nevada based gold company that – as things stand – has two projects in its portfolio. The first is the above mentioned Keystone project, which will be the core focus of this discussion and is the project that accounts for the majority of its current valuation and forward potential. The second is a copper project located in Wyoming called Copper King. It's a little farther along the development pathway than Keystone, with another company already having conducted a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) at the site back in 2012, but it looks as though it will take something of a back seat over the next twelve to eighteen months as management allocates resources (read: money) towards the advancing of Keystone towards production. Management is strong and, most notably, includes Dave Mathewson as VP and Head of Exploration and Luke Norman as Co-Founder and Corporate Developer. The former, Mathewson, is a world renowned geologist that has extensive experience in the Nevada exploration space, having (prior to his involvement with US Gold Corp) headed up the teams responsible for the discovery and processing of some of gold mining giant Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM)'s biggest resources along the Cortez Trend. The latter, Norman, teamed up with Mathewson at a company called Gold Standard Ventures Corp (NYSEMKT:GSV), subsequent to Mathewson's tenure with Newmont, and combined to carry the company from a $15 million gold exploration startup to a billion dollar producer in 2016 (as of July 2017, Gold Standard Ventures trades for a market capitalization of $672 million). As a quick introduction to Keystone, the project is located in what can be referred to as prime Cortez territory, just south of Pipeline, Cortez Hills and Gold Rush deposits, three of Barrick's most productive deposits in Nevada, all of which produce multi million oz. of gold annually.So, back in May (at the time of my previous coverage of this one), US Gold Corp (at its Keystone property) held around 370 claims across a 12 square mile land expanse in Eureka County, Nevada. Since this time, as per the above noted fresh information made available by the company, this has increased to 479 claims spread across an area of almost 15 square miles. It's a modest expansion (there's a degree of further expansion that just got announced, which I'll get to in a bit more detail in a minute) and it forms one part of what amounts to a two-pronged strategy for the company at the project. The first is to expand the claim count in the district (district here refers to a property that contains numerous claims spread across (what are theorized to be) numerous separate resource deposits. The second is to establish resource estimates for the project in its current form. In terms of underpinning valuation and, by proxy, what's going to drive this one higher near term, this second element of the company's strategy is the more important of the two. This importance is rooted in exit, which is again something I'll get to in a little more detail shortly. So how far along is the company with its efforts in line with the above noted second prong of its operational strategy?During 2016, US Gold Corp conducted the drilling of five scout holes spread across the property. Scout holes (as their name suggests) are a sort of exploratory drilling type, which are not as deep or as wide as the drill holes generally associated with a full scale drilling program but can still be incredibly useful in terms of both establishing early insight into the geological profile of a project and identifying areas that potentially hold the most promise (and in turn, using this identification to inform drilling). With that said, and as highlighted in a recent interview with the above mentioned Luke Norman, these may be scout holes, but there's no reason why the company can't encounter a major gold deposit through one of the holes in question. In line with this suggestion, Norman said this of the drill holes to date: "In fact, from what we've seen so far from some of these scout holes, there is a possibility that we may already be into a discovery."This would be a bonus, of course. Markets aren’t expecting the company to strike on an early scout hole, but the program to data has supported expectations of strong geological correlation between already producing mines in the region and while it's an outside chance, it's a distinct possibility. Here's another quote from Norman, taken from the same interview:"What we realized immediately when we saw our first hole out of Keystone is we have this massive, thick, multi-layered rock package underlying the project that is identical in nature to Cortez Hills and actually very similar to the biggest gold deposits on the Carlin trend as well."Going forward into the remainder of 2017, US Gold Corp expects to drill up to three more holes of scout nature. Beyond that, and as outlined above, the company is going to use the data collected from these holes to inform an expanded drilling program, what's called the vectoring process, throughout 2018. In terms of initial estimates, and based on both scout holes and historical drilling at the site, which demonstrated that mineralization from the surface down to a depth of 695 Feet comes in at 0.3 g. up to 1.5 g. gold per ton, US Gold Corp is targeting an initial resource of more than $1 million oz. gold. Longer term, with estimates rooted in the output of projects in the reason with similar geological characteristics and – again – based on the early stage drill results, the company expands this target to 10 million oz. gold. During the coming twelve months, efforts will be focused on refining these estimates, rooted in advanced mapping and geophysics and existing mapping digitization, soil and rock sampling, drill target selection (and associated permitting) and – ultimately – drilling.As noted earlier, there's another development rooted in the expansion of the project as a whole but not technically rooted in Keystone. On July 5, the company announced that it had acquired a portfolio of claims called the Gold Bar North (GBN) mining claims. Just as with Keystone, GBN is located in Eureka County and consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims. The map below illustrates the proximity of these claims to the core Keystone project:  This is another one resource in which Mathewson's has had a hand historically, with the company's Head of Exploration expanding the claims associated with the resource from an initial 19 core claims to the 49 claims currently associated with the project throughout 2016. It's in line with a couple of already established deposits, specifically the Gold Bar and Mill Site, each of which has produced strong and economic gold output historically. Notably, the Gold Bar deposit was composed of 3.95Mt at a grade of 2.95 g. per ton and was mined out by Atlas Corp. from 1987-1992.The plan going forward is to consolidate this region with the Keystone project, bringing the total district (which we assume will exist under the Keystone moniker) to around 550 claims based on current claim count. So what's next?With the scout hole results in place from last year's program and the remaining holes set to be drilled throughout late 2017, US Gold Corp has a strong foundation on which to build towards a resource estimate. As noted above, the importance of getting such an estimate in place is centered around exit strategies for the company and its shareholders. Explorers like this one require capital to bring a project to production. Generally, this capital comes from the public markets and – often – through partnerships with already established mining companies (such as Barrick and Newmont, mentioned throughout this piece) or through deals with gold royalty companies like Franco Nevada. All of these options necessitate the establishing of a solid resource estimate, which the entity providing the capital can use as a platform on which to base its valuation of the borrowing company (in this case, US Gold Corp) and – in turn – the amount of money it's willing to lend and on what terms. As such, this estimate is the next key development for US Gold Corp and every step closer to its establishing that the company gets is a potential upside driver. At last count, the company had a little over $7 million cash on hand and commands a market capitalization of just $3.48 million. For some, that in itself is enough of an incentive for picking up an exposure in anticipation of a metric-driven revaluation.

"Follow the Gold" with Geologist Dave Mathewson; From Newmont ($NEM) to Gold Standard Ventures ($GSV) to US Gold Corp ($USAU)
Recent Gold Bar North Acquisition from Dave Mathewson Important Strategic Addition for US Gold Corp
 

Point Roberts, WA - July 17, 2017 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading sectors including mining stocks releases a Nevada gold miners snapshot following the trail of legendary geologist Dave Mathewson.
Dave Mathewson is a well-known and quoted geologist-explorer with 35 years of exploration experience in Nevada alone. Notable discoveries made while Head of Newmont (NEM) Nevada's Exploration team from 1989 through 2001 include: Tess, Northwest Rain, Saddle and South Emigrant in the Rain mining district. From 1999-2001 the Mathewson led team made important deposit extension discoveries at Newmont's Gold Quarry and Mike deposits. Today, Newmont owns or controls approximately 2.8 million acres in Nevada and operations include 11 surface mines, 8 underground mines and 13 processing facilities.
At Gold Standard Ventures (GSV), Dave Mathewson's work led to the consolidation of the Railroad-Pinion district and the North Bullion & Bald Mountain discoveries. The Railroad-Pinion Gold Project is the Company's flagship project in North Central Nevada. The 100% owned/controlled project covers approximately 208 sq. km (52.7k acres).
And now Mathewson is leading the team at US Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) as Vice President and Head of Exploration.  He recently told Investorideas in an interview, "We recently acquired the entire Keystone district. This was led by me mostly through my own claims. I had some existing claims in that area since 2002 and adding the rest of the claims - we have the entire district now locked up," he said. "To have the entire district, within which to explore under one's control - you can then apply some broader geophysics, geochemistry and get the context much more importantly and beneficially to the more focused exploration."
The expansion continues as US Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) just announced this month that it completed the acquisition of the Gold Bar North (GBN) mining claims. US Gold Corp acquired Gold Bar North on June 30, 2017 from Dave Mathewson.
The Gold Bar North Property consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims in Eureka County, Nevada. The only financial obligation required to maintain these claims are the annual federal and county fees.
GBN is a highly prospective gold exploration property, identified and staked by Dave Mathewson. GBN consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 29, 30, 31 and 32, Township 23 North, Range 49 East, and Sections 5 and 6, Township 22 North, Range 49 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.




In their recent press release Dave Mathewson, Vice President and Head of Nevada Exploration stated, "I believe that Gold Bar North is an important strategic addition to the Keystone district project. In early 2016, I expanded the Gold Bar North holding from the original 19 core claims that I held to a total of 49 claims which now more completely cover the Gold Bar North gravity and magnetic high and associated permissive carbonate horst. Gold Bar North (GBN) is clearly on line with the Gold Bar and Mill Site gold deposits located within the permissive carbonate Gold Bar horst farther to the south. The Gold Bar deposit was composed of 3.95Mt at a grade of 2.95 g/t with a 1.5-to-1 waste-to-ore strip and 90 percent gold recovery in an oxide CIL mill. Gold Bar was mined out by Atlas Corp. from 1987-1992. The geology/stratigraphy of GBN is very similar to that of both Keystone and Gold Bar. I drilled three holes (from 2004 to 2006), and more were drilled (1989-1990) by Newmont's (NEM) (Buckaroo project), and all exhibited interesting alteration characteristics and geochemistry. There is an apparent strong regional structural tie-in of Gold Bar North with both Keystone and Gold Bar. The Gold Bar district is highly prospective with McEwen Mining's (MUX - NYSE) Gold Bar Development Project and Gold Bar South property nearby."
So what is next for this world- class geologist? More land and more gold of course; it's a passion in his blood that fills his veins just like the gold in the land he loves to explore.

"Follow the Gold" with Geologist Dave Mathewson; From Newmont ( $NEM) to Gold Standard Ventures ( $GSV) to US Gold Corp ( $USAU)Recent Gold Bar North Acquisition from Dave Mathewson Important Strategic Addition for US Gold CorpPoint Roberts, WA July 17, 2017 Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading sectors including mining stocks releases a Nevada gold miners snapshot following the trail of legendary geologist Dave Mathewson.Dave Mathewson is a well-known and quoted geologist-explorer with 35 years of exploration experience in Nevada alone. Notable discoveries made while Head of Newmont (NEM) Nevada's Exploration team from 1989 through 2001 include: Tess, Northwest Rain, Saddle and South Emigrant in the Rain mining district. From 1999-2001 the Mathewson led team made important deposit extension discoveries at Newmont's Gold Quarry and Mike deposits. Today, Newmont owns or controls approximately 2.8 million acres in Nevada and operations include 11 surface mines, 8 underground mines and 13 processing facilities.At Gold Standard Ventures (GSV), Dave Mathewsons work led to the consolidation of the Railroad-Pinion district and the North Bullion & Bald Mountain discoveries. The Railroad-Pinion Gold Project is the Companys flagship project in North Central Nevada. The 100% owned/controlled project covers approximately 208 sq. km (52.7k acres).And now Mathewson is leading the team at US Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) as Vice President and Head of Exploration. He recently told Investorideas in an interview, "We recently acquired the entire Keystone district. This was led by me mostly through my own claims. I had some existing claims in that area since 2002 and adding the rest of the claims - we have the entire district now locked up," he said. "To have the entire district, within which to explore under one's control - you can then apply some broader geophysics, geochemistry and get the context much more importantly and beneficially to the more focused exploration."The expansion continues as US Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) just announced this month that it completed the acquisition of the Gold Bar North (GBN) mining claims. US Gold Corp acquired Gold Bar North on June 30, 2017 from Dave Mathewson.The Gold Bar North Property consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims in Eureka County, Nevada. The only financial obligation required to maintain these claims are the annual federal and county fees.GBN is a highly prospective gold exploration property, identified and staked by Dave Mathewson. GBN consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada, in Sections 29, 30, 31 and 32, Township 23 North, Range 49 East, and Sections 5 and 6, Township 22 North, Range 49 East, Mount Diablo Base Line and Meridian.In their recent press release Dave Mathewson, Vice President and Head of Nevada Exploration stated, "I believe that Gold Bar North is an important strategic addition to the Keystone district project. In early 2016, I expanded the Gold Bar North holding from the original 19 core claims that I held to a total of 49 claims which now more completely cover the Gold Bar North gravity and magnetic high and associated permissive carbonate horst. Gold Bar North (GBN) is clearly on line with the Gold Bar and Mill Site gold deposits located within the permissive carbonate Gold Bar horst farther to the south. The Gold Bar deposit was composed of 3.95Mt at a grade of 2.95 g/t with a 1.5-to-1 waste-to-ore strip and 90 percent gold recovery in an oxide CIL mill. Gold Bar was mined out by Atlas Corp. from 1987-1992. The geology/stratigraphy of GBN is very similar to that of both Keystone and Gold Bar. I drilled three holes (from 2004 to 2006), and more were drilled (1989-1990) by Newmont's (NEM) (Buckaroo project), and all exhibited interesting alteration characteristics and geochemistry. There is an apparent strong regional structural tie-in of Gold Bar North with both Keystone and Gold Bar. The Gold Bar district is highly prospective with McEwen Mining's (MUX - NYSE) Gold Bar Development Project and Gold Bar South property nearby."So what is next for this world- class geologist? More land and more gold of course; its a passion in his blood that fills his veins just like the gold in the land he loves to explore.Hear recent podcast interview with Dave Mathewson: http://www.investorideas.com/CO/USAU/news/2017/06291Podcast-Keystone.aspAbout US Gold Corp.US Gold Corp is a publicly traded U.S. focused gold exploration and development company.

Expert Comments:










Updated Resource Estimate for Nevada Gold Project Increases Overall Ounces by 162%
				(7/11/17)

			    		An NI-43-101-compliant resource estimate for the Dark Star gold deposit, part of this company's 100%-owned Railroad-Pinion Project, beat one analyst's expectations and was called a "good start" by another.

      Brian Szeto, PI Financial
  

(6/29/17)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced a resource update for its Dark Star deposit. . .total resources at Dark Star have increased from 375 Koz (at 0.51 g/t gold) to 981 Koz (at 0.94 g/t gold), which represents an 85% increase in grades and 162% increase in overall ounces. . .mineralization still remains open in a number of directions."
		
		












  
      Michael Gray, Macquarie Capital Markets
  

(6/29/17)

		
		"[It's a] good start/initial resource for Gold Standard Ventures Corp.'s Dark Star oxide complex with 980 Koz Au in resources, broken down as 265 Koz at 0.5 g/t Au for Main Dark Star and 715 Koz Au at 1.3 g/t Au for North Dark Star. . .the company plans +12 km drilling in 2017 and has just received drill permits."
		
		









  Haywood Securities 

(6/16/17)

		
		"This week, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced the completion of a previously announced acquisition of all the issued and outstanding common shares of Battle Mountain. . .effective June 14, 2017, Battle Mountain common shares were delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange, as it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gold Standard."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(6/1/17)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has begun its previously announced drill program on the Railroad-Pinion project's Dark Star and North Bullion deposits. The $15.5M program will feature up to 48,800m of
drilling in 117 holes. . .I'm excited about this program, as it is both aggressive and targeted to areas with significant potential to grow the overall project's resource base."
		
		









  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(5/1/17)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has been busy over the past month, growing its project base through acquisition, adding to its land position along the Carlin trend and announcing revised assay information on its Dark Star deposit. . .the company is well-cashed and well-positioned for growth through exploration in a rising gold market."
		
		
















Dark Star Shining Brightly for Gold Standard Ventures in Nevada 
				(4/20/17)

			    		Exploration company Gold Standard Ventures has reported multiple results from its Dark Star prospect at its 100%-owned Railroad-Pinon project over the past week and a half.

Gold Standard Ventures Is Building Its Portfolio with Battle Mountain Gold Acquisition
				(4/13/17)

			    		The purchase of Battle Mountain Gold gives Gold Standard Ventures another large project in one of Nevada's largest gold producing districts.

      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(4/12/17)

		
		"On April 12, 2017, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced it had reached an agreement to acquire Battle Mountain for a combination of cash and stock. We believe Gold Standard views the asset as a strategic second exploration asset. . .we are maintaining our Buy rating."
		
		
















Gold Standard Ventures Offers District-Scale and Takeout Potential
				(3/9/17)

			    		Gold Standard Ventures' aggressive 2017 drill program has the potential to substantially increase resources at its Nevada project, and with Goldcorp and OceanaGold owning substantial percentages of the company, Gold Standard  has already caught the eye of producers.

		"This morning, before market open, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced a friendly shares and cash bid for Battle Mountain Gold specifically for its 100%-owned, 2225 ha Lewis project. . .with today's acquisition of Battle Mountain Gold, the company enhanced its Nevada portfolio further, with a second project, on trend to +50 Moz in the prolific Battle Mountain trend."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced the acquisition of Battle Mountain Gold Inc. . .we view the transaction positively as Gold Standard now has two projects located in two of Nevada's most prolific gold trends (the Carlin trend and the Battle Mountain trend).
In addition, it now also has two projects that are directly adjacent to two of Newmont's operating mines in Nevada (Phoenix and Emigrant/Rain) thus increasing the likelihood of Gold Standard being a takeout candidate itself down the road."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. reported good metallurgical results from the first comprehensive test work that's designed to determine the recovery potential for gold at the Dark Star oxide gold deposit. . .cyanide-soluble recoveries averaged over 88% in the Main Dark Star oxide zone and over 89% in the North Dark Star oxide zone. These results indicate this material is likely to support heap-leach processing, which is a critical factor to potential suitors."

		"On April 10, 2017, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced results for metallurgical recovery test work on its Dark Star deposit. Results were better than expected and should enable the company to move toward an initial PEA on the combined Pinion and Dark Star projects; thus, we are reiterating our Buy rating."

		"We think the weakness in Gold Standard Ventures Corp.'s shares over the past few weeks is a buying opportunity. We have a high conviction that the south portion of the Carlin trend has high potential to host multiple high-grade shallow oxide gold deposits along with multiple sulphide gold deposits. . .we reiterate our Outperform rating."

		"Today, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced preliminary metallurgical work from the oxide mineralization at Main Dark Star, which had average recoveries of 89% over 320 samples and an average of 90% at North Dark Star over 1,073 samples. . .we view these results positively and continue to confirm the company's thesis that the project can be mined via an open-pit, heap-leach scenario."

		"Last week, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced that it recently acquired almost 21,000 contiguous acres of prospective mining rights at its exploration area near Ely, Nevada, in the heart of the Carlin trend. . .overall, it equates to roughly 45% of the company's total land package of 52,000 acres. . .Gold Standard is cashed up, with a solid drilling program set to kick off when the weather breaks."

		"Buy Gold Standard Ventures Corp. after a significant 'land grab' last week, expanding flagship, 100%-owned, Railroad-Pinion's land package by 66% to 208 km sq in the Carlin trend, Nevada. We believe any time a company adds strike length land positions on trend to very prospective geology at an attractive upfront cost of ~$500K (and annual holding costs of ~$290K) that it is potentially highly accretive; Gold Standard is an explorer Top Pick."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. reported that it has added a ~20 kha largely contiguous land position immediately south of its 100%-owned Railroad-Pinion project. . .the additions were via lease agreements and by staking for ~$500K. . .we reiterate our Outperform rating."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. is busy revving up for its aggressive 2017 program, which will include 48,800m of drilling in 117 reverse circulation and diamond drill holes; the $15.5M program will seek to expand the North Dark Star discovery, grow the Pinion resource and test other high-grade targets within the district-scale project. It's an ambitious program and one I expect to add significant value to this project and this company."

		"High-grade gold have become the norm for Gold Standard Ventures Corp. as its drilling program on Railroad-Pinion�s North Dark Star deposit continues. . .in a sign of how much the market thinks of the results coming from GSV'S North Dark Star, the company's share price has ticked only slightly downward in the face of strong headwinds from the broader market. . . it�s also a sign that investors appreciate the likelihood of Gold Standard being taken out by one of the majors already in Nevada. . .it's a solid hold on our list at current levels and a potential buy on any significant weakness."

		"Goldcorp will own 22.9 million shares of Gold Standard Ventures Corp. which represents 10% of the Company. . .the proceeds of the financing will be used to acquire certain royalty interests at Pinion-Railroad, purchase additional land claims, continued exploration work, and for general corporate purposes. . .our NAV estimate remains largely unchanged at $3.23/sh (was $3.21/sh). We continue to apply a multiple of 1.2x (unchanged) to the operating portion of our NAV, which
represents a takeout premium, to arrive at our target price of $3.70/sh

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. took advantage of its strong share price to raise no less than $38 million. There was obviously a good amount of interest in the raise, as it was announced at $25 million and three days later was boosted to $38 million. . .Goldcorp, which took a 9.9% stake in GSV in February, is participating pro rata, which means the gold major is putting another $15M into Gold Standard. . .with this raise Gold Standard has almost $60M in the bank. As such it is incredibly well funded to aggressively drill all the targets at the Railroad project."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Inc. released one particularly nice drill hole from North Dark Star. . .Dark Star has been delivering the most exciting results for the company and the latest three holes fit that bill. In particular, hole 16-24 returned 3.16 g/t gold over 97.3 meters. . .the stock remains a buy for GSV�s large land package, multiple discoveries, extent of pending news flow, backing from majors, and discovery potential."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. reported drill results for three holes from its North Dark Star discovery, 100% Railroad-Pinion project, Carlin Trend, Nevada, US. . . .We remind investors that North Dark Star is accentuated by three attractive features that indicate a large Carlin gold system is being documented: 1) very high grade +3g/t, long +100m intersections; 2) +300m thick, strong decalcification alteration, and; 3) extensive development of barite. . .

		"We continue to believe that Gold Standard Ventures Corp. will be able to delineate a meaningful high grade initial resource estimate at North Dark Star at the conclusion of this year's drill program to compliment the combined 2.1 Moz resource that has already been established at the Company's nearby Pinion and Dark Star deposits. . .our NAV estimate remains the same at $3.21/sh. . .we continue to apply a multiple of 1.2x unchanged)to the operating portion of our NAV, which represents a takeout premium, to arrive at our target price of $3.70/sh (unchanged). . .we are maintaining our BUY recommendation and SPECULATIVE risk rating."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. continues to pump out impressive assays from drilling on North Dark Star . . .the area intersected is an up-dip extension of the discovery area at North Dark Star. . .not only is the mineralization nearer to surface than the mineralization from previous holes, but it demonstrates the expansion potential here via the drill bit. . .the company�s share price has fallen off a bit since the big run up based on last month�s results. . .we�ll keep it a hold for now, but will consider adding it back to the buy list if this weakness in the face of quality drilling results continues."

		"In February, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced that Goldcorp Inc. made a CA$16.1 million strategic investment and OceanaGold Corp. made a CA$13.8 million strategic investment. Not long after, Gold Standard announced a US$13.4 million 2016 exploration program for its Railroad-Pinion project in Nevada. The release in August of an eye-popping intersection from drilling on its North Dark Star deposit led the stock to rocket higher. A key component of the company's flagship Railroad-Pinion project along Nevada's Carlin Trend, North Dark Star hosts a higher-grade zone discovered last year by Hole 15-13. . .clearly, these are exciting results, and Gold Standard plans to follow up on them by devoting a greater portion of its 2016 drilling program at Railroad-Pinion to Dark Star. Finding high-grade gold at these widths (this near surface and in this part of the world) makes this company a legitimate takeout target. . .with these latest results, it's very likely that Gold Standard gets bought out by one of the majors already operating in Nevada, or by one that wants to finally get a toe-hold."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. CEO Jonathan Awde discussed efforts to develop a promising 'window' of gold-bearing acreage in the sweetest of sweet spots of Nevada's mighty Carlin Trend. This land position is second in size only to that of mining giant Barrick Gold. . .Gold Standard holds key acreage adjacent to existing mines owned by Newmont and along trend from Barrick. . .the company's Carlin focus places it in the cross hairs of future takeover activity, likely in the billion-dollar range. . .there's upside here as gold prices continue to ascend; maintain buy up to $3.25."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp.'s Hole 16-21 yielded another good intersection and confirms up-dip extension at North Dark Star. . .hole 16-21 documented a thick, oxide intersectional of 56m at 1.83g/tAu, confirming an 85m up-dip extension (to the east) to hole 16-08 with 126m at 3.95g/tAu. This grade variability is typical of strong Carlin-type deposits and as pointed out in previous research notes - the very high grades strongly suggest GSV is drilling a large gold system."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced a strong hole from North Bullion, which is the northern-most target area at the Railroad-Pinion project. . .North Bullion is a collapse breccia gold deposit, which is one of the Carlin Trend's classic deposit types. These zones carry high gold grades and can be quite large. . .I like to see Gold Standard reporting results from multiple zones. . .reporting results from several zones reminds the market of all those opportunities. . .the market is definitely waiting for further results from Dark Star, which I�m sure are pending."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. rocketed higher earlier this month due to the release of an eye-popping intersection from drilling on its North Dark Star deposit. . .hole 16-08 from this year's program was drilled. . .and it managed to top that hole's impressive results, cutting an uber-long 126.2-meter interval of 3.95 g/t gold. . .clearly, these are exciting results, and Gold Standard plans to follow up on them by devoting a greater portion of its 2016 drilling program at RailroadPinion to Dark Star. Finding highgrade gold at these widths makes this company a legitimate takeout target."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. reported results for two diamond drill holes that tested its North Bullion deposit. . .An 11.2g/tAu over 8.5m intersection in hole R16-01 is important as it is a significant ~120m step-out hole and confirms a NW trend interpretation that management will now be able to test on a predictive basis, farther to the NW. . .North Bullion's emerging NW high grade trend highlights the multi-target potential of the large 18km long land package. . .We reiterate our Outperform Rating and C$4.10 target price."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. followed up its hot hole two weeks ago with a good hole last week, reporting 101 metres grading 1.5 g/t gold from the same approximate area. . .North Dark Star is shaping up as a promising gold oxide zone and this intercept extended the high-grade zone within it by 120 metres to the south, putting the defined high-grade strike at 220 metres. Importantly, the gold in this hole came in exactly the same stratigraphy as the hot hole to the north. . .Consistent mineralization in a thick section of carbonate rock is a good thing in the Carlin Trend."

		"Recommendation: Buy Gold Standard Ventures Corp., and in our opinion, they have a tiger by the tail having documented high grade oxide & large thicknesses in the southern +100moz Carlin Trend. . .We have increased our target price to $4.10 (was $3.85), after GSV reported assays for two core drill holes, at its Dark Star North discovery, within its flagship 100% owned, Railroad/Pinion Project, Carlin Trend, Nevada . . .It is our view that the Railroad-Pinion gold project has Tier 1 (+20moz) potential and that such discoveries will attract M&A at the +$1bn market cap level."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp.'s North Dark Star gold project continues to demonstrate the potential to extend high-grade, oxidized gold mineralization. . .We note that the results from DS16-01 supports the interpretation that the geometry of gold mineralization at North Dark Star is a norht-south striking high-grade zone that is bound by the West fault and Dark star fault to the west and east respectively. . .We note that the deposit remains open along strike to the east of current drilling and well along strike to the north and south. We look forward to the results of additional drill holes that are designed to test the continuity of gold mineralization."

Its Carlin-focused gold play places the company in the cross hairs of future takeover activity, likely in the billion-dollar range."

		"I like exploration companies that carefully navigated the downturn, keeping costs and dilution down. One of these companies that I own is Gold Standard Ventures Corp. Gold Standard Ventures has been a spectacular stock during this downturn. The management team put their heads down and consolidated the whole district. Gold Standard gained the support of Goldcorp and OceanaGold, the two most successful companies during this downturn, at premium to its share price. It also made a strategic investment in Battle Mountain Gold Inc., which was dead for many years because of its very high royalty rate. The company bought down the royalty to a reasonable level and is now ready to explore."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced additional drill results at its North Dark Star deposit; results included a significant high-grade drill intercept that we believe supports our previous belief that North Dark Star and Dark Star could connect at depth. . .DS16-08 intersected 126.2m grading 3.95 g/t gold beginning at a depth of 165.2m. Drill results of this grade and thickness have become increasingly less common over the last decade in Nevada, making it a significant discovery, in our view."

They have done it so many times it's starting to get boring. . .Investors need to start moving to the really quality stocks. GSV is one of them. Everything I have said about them has been proven to be true and I'm proud of the fact that I "got" it a long time ago. This last drill hole was a home run.

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp.'s 2015 exploration program produced resources of 423 Koz gold in Indicated and 1.02 Moz in Inferred at Pinion, in addition to another 375 Koz in Inferred at Dark Star. Given this success, gold majors Goldcorp and OceanaGold announced strategic investments in Gold Standard as the firm continues to uncover what we view as large potential. . .the strategic investments place Gold Standard in the envious position of having a fully stocked treasury�currently over $40M in cash and a plethora of additional targets to explore."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. released an updated resource estimate for its Pinion deposit that showed a substantial upgrade of existing inferred resources into indicated resources. . .perhaps more intriguing than the upgrade in the indicated resource is the fact that many of the holes drilled in 2015 on the Railroad-Pinion project as a whole indicate significant potential for further expansion. . .the Carlin Trend is home to some of the largest gold deposits in the world and with a significant amount of gold already outlined at Railroad-Pinion, Gold Standard Ventures has the money, the plan and the targets to add this project to this region�s many storied deposits."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced an updated resource estimate for Pinion, which is one of its two existing deposits at its flagship Railroad-Pinion project in Nevada. . .total resources have increased by close to 20%, to 1.7 Moz with an average grade of 0.57 g/t gold from its previous estimate of 1.4 Moz with an average grade of 0.59 g/t gold. . .the company's gold inventory is now over 2.0 Moz and remains on track to achieve our estimate of 2.5�3.0 Moz for the overall project. . .our new target price is CA$1.50/share (was CA$1.30/share)."

		"The recent capital injections are a strong endorsement of the potential the smart money sees in Gold Standard Venture Corp.'s flagship Railroad-Pinion gold project. I've kept the company on our list through the downturn in gold because I continue to think Railroad-Pinion's potential is massive; judging from the aggressive drilling program it has slated for the project in 2016, management also believes strongly in that potential."
		
		












The Gold Report Interview with Joe Mazumdar 

(2/25/16)

		
		"Goldcorp recently invested in Gold Standard Ventures Corp., which has one of the largest land packages in Nevada not owned by a major. Then OceanaGold, which already owned a chunk of the company, raised its stake to 19.9%. It's unusual to see two companies vying for part of the same exploration play. This renewed interest in exploration is good for the market as a whole.  . .it's the jurisdiction (Nevada) and the size of the land package that made it attractive to these two companies. Other than Barrick and Newmont Mining, no company has that size of a land package in Nevada. Gold Standard Ventures is considered to be a good vehicle for a major company to get leverage to a Nevada footprint."

		"On Feb. 23, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced its 2016 exploration program. The $13.4M program is expected to total 43,000m of reverse-circulation drilling across 100 holes, with the majority of the drilling focusing on the Dark Star and Pinion deposits. That being said, the program is fully funded, as the company currently has a strong balance sheet with over CA$40M cash and no debt. . .in our view, strong interest from two major gold producers not only bolsters Gold Standard's balance sheet, allowing for exploration work, but also serves as a vote of confidence."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has announced that OceanaGold will exercise its right to further increase its ownership in the company to 19.9%. . .this is in response to Goldcorp's $16.1M investment (at $1/share) in it on Feb. 1, 2016, which represented an initial 9.9% interest. . .this bodes well for the investors of Gold Standard as this may lead to a bidding war for it down the road."
		
		













  Thibaut Lepouttre of Caesars Report for Streetwise Reports 

(2/4/16)

		
		"Not only was Nevada-focused gold explorer Gold Standard Ventures Corp. able to attract CA$16.1M in new funding, Goldcorp's placement was also conducted at a premium to the market price (16% above the 20 day Volume Weighted Average Price [VWAP]) and allowed Goldcorp to initiate a relatively large stake in Gold Standard. I would like to take a moment to explain the importance of not just being able to raise cash at a premium, but raising it from one of the industry's most respected companies. Goldcorp usually has a conservative investment approach and the company most definitely isn't acquiring stakes in companies on a daily basis. In fact, Goldcorp has been selling some non-core assets in the recent past, but now seems to be in buying mode again. . .with a mid-tier and a senior gold producer having taken strategic stakes in Gold Standard Ventures in the past few quarters, the project continues to be derisked and Gold Standard Ventures now has ample cash to drill quite a lot of meters. Gold Standard has spent years putting together the second largest continuous land package in the Carlin Trend after Newmont Mining, which sets up the possibility for a meaningful size discovery. . .2016 will be a very important year for Gold Standard as a new large drill program will increase the company's understanding of the mineralized zone. And even after drilling 40,000�50,000 meters, Gold Standard should still end the year with in excess of CA$15M in the treasury (assuming OceanaGold does not exercise its anti-dilution rights), which makes this company stand out from the crowd."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp.'s flagship project is Railroad-Pinion, a large Carlin Trend property with three defined deposits. It's a land package that was splintered for years, which stymied systematic exploration. . .all three deposits remain open for expansion, and the property offers a good number of other targets. And now the company has a refilled bank account to expand those deposits and test those targets, following a CA$16.1M buy-in by Goldcorp. . .altogether, 2015 was a very successful year for Gold Standard�and apparently Goldcorp thought so too."

		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. received an investment from Goldcorp; this is probably the most successful gold exploration company during this downturn. It received investments from OceanaGold and Goldcorp, two of the most successful gold miners; this tells you how good its assets are."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(1/21/16)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has been bucking the broader market in recent months, as excitement mounts over the drill results coming in from its Railroad-Pinion project. . .which suggest it may hold the trend's next elephant-sized gold deposit. . .with three significant gold deposits and one of the largest land positions along the Carlin Trend, Railroad-Pinion is a target-rich environment with a lot of exploration upside still left. The company's stock remains a Buy."
		
		









  Haywood Securities 

(1/21/16)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has successfully consolidated a highly prospective gold exploration portfolio along the southeast end of Nevada's extremely prolific Carlin Trend. The consolidation has allowed the company to discover and delineate a number of gold deposits within this land package, including the North Bullion sulfide gold project discovered in 2010 and the Pinion and Dark Star oxide gold projects, located approximately 10km to the south of North Bullion. . .Gold Standard has successfully defined NI-43-101-compliant resources for both Pinion and Dark Star. . .drill results are expected from Dark Star and Pinion over the coming weeks."

		"We are initiating coverage of Gold Standard Ventures Corp. with a Buy recommendation, a target price of CA$1.00/share and a risk rating of Speculative. We believe the stock offers an opportunity to invest in an aggressive gold exploration and development company that is quickly advancing what we believe will be a technically simple and economically viable gold project into production. In addition, the company's flagship asset is located in Nevada, which is considered one of the most pro-mining jurisdictions globally. Gold Standard's management team has very successfully added value to the project through land consolidation, initial resource estimation, and resource expansion."
		
		












  
      Eric Zaunscherb, Canaccord Genuity
  

(1/20/16)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures is a well-funded exploration company. . .its land package constitutes the second largest land package within the highly coveted Carlin trend of Northern Nevada, which has grown over the past five years from 2,555 ha originally to 11,555 ha."
		
		












  
      Bob Moriarty, 321 Gold
(12/23/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has one of the largest untested pieces left in the Carlin Trend. While it has spent the last five years looking for another Carlin elephant, slowly it has been adding ounces in a near-surface oxide district that will be a mine. . .the company has already begun to recover. It was $0.69/share when I wrote about it a month ago just after they announced their latest drill results. The company is up 30% in the last month. I expect it to continue to be among the leaders in the next bull phase if we have hit a bottom or not."

(12/7/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp., an advanced-stage gold exploration company focused on district-scale discoveries on the Railroad-Pinion gold project in Nevada's Carlin Trend. The company brought with it news of new gold intersects north of the Dark Star Gold deposit that, according to management, 'confirm discovery of a substantial new, higher-grade oxide deposit.'"

      Bob Moriarty, 321 Gold
(11/18/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. is well cashed up and continues to expand the district; in any rational market the shares would be a substantial multiple of where they are today. On Nov. 4 of this year, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. released what might be considered obscene results, 149.4m of 1.38 g/t gold 540m north of the initial 375,000 Inferred resource at Dark Star. . .a week later, it released another blistering set of results, an even more impressive 157m of 1.51 g/t gold."
		
		












  
      Ryan Walker, Euro Pacific Canada
  

(11/16/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. returned another long mineralized interval from the 100%-owned Railroad-Pinion project in Nevada's Carlin trend. Hole DS15-11, collared ~515m north of the Dark Star maiden resource, cut an oxidized zone of 157m (from 103.7m down hole) grading 1.51 g/t Au, including several higher-grade sections, including 21.3m (105.2m) at 3.17 g/t."

(11/13/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. hit a long intersection in drilling on its Railroad-Pinion project. . .hole 11 hit an impressive 157m of 1.51 g/t gold. . .a great bet on discovery with a downside protected by ounces in the ground, the company looks like an excellent value right now. It's a Buy."
		
		












  
      Gwen  Preston, Resource Maven
(11/11/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. added to the good drill news from its Dark Star oxide gold deposit in Nevada with another solid hole: 157m grading 1.51 g/t gold. . .an 80-hole drill program is underway, designed to expand and upgrade the resource. Expansion now looks pretty darn likely. . .it looks like the company has tapped into a new, blind oxide gold zone."

(11/11/15)

		
		"We are increasing our target to $2 (was $1.75) and recommend buying Gold Standard Ventures Corp. for exposure to its top-notch Carlin trend exploration play that has multiple permissive targets and an outstanding technical team. . .yesterday, before market open, followup drilling documented oxide mineralization 157m at 1.51g/t Au, the highest grade and longest intersection within the Dark Star corridor."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(11/11/15)

		
		"On Nov. 10, 2015, Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced drilling results for its wholly owned Railroad-Pinion project. Notably, two drill holes appear to have uncovered a new gold zone approximately 515m to the north of the mineralization outlined in the initial Dark Star resource estimate. . .we believe the significance of these holes should not go unnoticed."
		
		












  
      Brent Cook, Exploration Insights
(11/11/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. released assays from its second reverse circulation drill hole into the north of the Dark Star discovery on its Railroad-Pinion property. . .these are indeed impressive drill holes. . .yesterday the company released DS15-11, which intersected 157m grading 1.51 g/t gold, beginning at a drill depth of 103m. DS15-11 was drilled parallel to and about 60m above DS15-10."
		
		












  
      Mick Carew, Haywood Securities
  

(11/4/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. released drill assay results from its Dark Star oxide gold deposit on its 100%-owned and controlled Railway-Pinion project in Nevada's Carlin trend. Four of the five drill holes returned gold assays above the cut-off grade of the NI-43-101-compliant resource estimate completed by APEX Geosciences and released March 3, 2015. . .highlighting the expansion potential of the Dark Star deposit along the 6km structural corridor to the north of the currently defined resource. Most importantly, the results from hole DS15-10 returned gold grades that are several orders of magnitude higher than previous drill results from Dark Star."
		
		












  
      Gwen  Preston, Resource Maven
(11/4/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. announced a healthy intercept of oxide gold mineralization from the Railroad-Pinion project. Specifically, hole DS15-10 returned 149.4m grading 1.38 g/t gold. All told, four of five holes testing the Dark Star structural corridor returned notable gold intercepts. . .the intercept in hole DS15-10 suggests a new zone that is thicker and significantly higher grade than anything previously drilled at Dark Star. . .the company had been planning to update its preliminary economic assessment, but those plans are now on hold until it gets a better hold of these new areas."
		
		












The Gold Report Interview with Chen Lin 

(11/2/15)

		
		"OceanaGold put in money to acquire 14.9% of Gold Standard Ventures Corp. at a premium to the share price and it is still buying Gold Standard Ventures stock on the open market. That's a typical sign, the interest of a major company in a junior. . .Gold Standard Ventures is currently drilling the south part of the deposit. Drillers already found a deep sulphide-based gold deposit on the north side. It's wide open space. There are lots of possibilities. Management now has a lot of capital to do exploration thanks to the recent investment from OceanaGold. That makes it an attractive takeover target."

(9/11/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has begun a phase 2 drilling program on Pinion and Dark Star. . .consisting of up to 8,600m, the program will include 10 holes offsetting hole 2 (24.4m 1.38 g/t gold) on the South Fault zone at Pinion and three holes on the Sentinel target. . .on the Dark Star target, the company will drill up to 11 holes to extend the mineralization to the north of hole 3 (32m 0.58 g/t gold and 21.3m 1.9 g/t gold) and two holes to probe the intersection of the South and Dark Star faults."

		
		









  Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial) 

(8/27/15)

		
		"Gold Standard Ventures Corp. has begun a phase 2 drill program on Pinion and Dark Star in Nevada. . .although it hasn't quite hit one yet, there's no doubt the company has its sights set on an elephant-sized deposit in this area. Given the number of multimillion-ounce gold mines that have been discovered along the Carlin Trend, its hope is well justified, particularly given the data that's already come back from previous drilling. We'll watch this program at Pinion and Dark Star eagerly."
