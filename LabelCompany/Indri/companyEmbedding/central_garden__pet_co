Dog Food
Your four-legged friend rewards you in many ways. Whether it’s accompanying you on a brisk jog to help you stay in shape, or giving you a cuddle when you need it most, there’s no denying how rewarding a pup can be. Show your appreciation and reward your furry friend with the foods and treats they crave. 

Chewy carries a wide range of delicious dog foods and tasty treats for your precious pup. When it comes to choosing a dog food, you may find all the options overwhelming. Let us help you find the best one with dog food reviews, ingredient information, and personal one-on-one attention when you give us a call at 1-800-672-4399. At Chewy we understand the important role dog food plays. Most of the nutrients your dog needs to stay strong and healthy comes from the food they eat. Chewy carries healthy dog food brands like Blue Buffalo, Royal Canin and Hill’s Prescription Diet. We even carry grain-free and limited ingredient diet dog foods for pups with food allergies or sensitivities. 

Dry dog food is great for the pup parent who is away all day. Dry dog kibble can be left out for your canine companion to snack on throughout the day without spoiling. Dry kibble can also be good for your dog’s teeth -crunchy kibble helps pups get rid of pesky plaque and tartar. Wet dog food often contains flavors and ingredients canines love. Freeze-dried dog food is another option, the limited ingredients in freeze-dried dog food varieties makes it great for pups with sensitive stomachs or food allergies. And you may also consider feeding your pup dehydrated dog food. Dehydrated dog food is created by taking the whole foods found in a raw doggie diet, and slowly heating them until they’re dehydrated. An added bonus: Dehydrated dog food is easy to transport for pup parents who are on the go. And, raw and frozen dog food is another great option. These doggie meals offer your pet the nutrition he was meant to consume in the wild and are rich in protein and typically contain less additives. Whether it’s dry kibble your dog desires or a grain-free wet meal your canine craves, you can find the best dog food brands on Chewy to please his palate and his nutritional needs.

Cat Food
Whether your feline friend is sitting down to a meal or enjoying a kitty snack, ensure they’re getting the nutrients they need, and the flavor they deserve with the top cat food and treats. Chewy carries only the best cat food brands, making shopping for your feline’s food easier than ever. Chewy carries cat food brands your cuddly kitty will love like Fancy Feast, Friskies & Royal Canin. A balanced diet is vital to the overall health of your courageous cat, but every cat has different needs and tastes. Cat food comes in a variety of textures, ingredients and flavors. There are also healthy cat food brands that offer recipes that help address health concerns like urinary tract health, allergies, digestive health and more. 

Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO cat food comes in wet and dry varieties, and helps promote urinary tract health. Urinary crystals and stones are often linked to this disease, but the most common cause of lower urinary tract disease is idiopathic cystitis. Wet and dry cat food that promotes urinary health can help dissolve pure struvite uroliths, and help prevent struvite, calcium oxalate and phosphate uroliths. Looking for natural cat food? Chewy carries natural cat food brands like Cat Chow and Natural Balance, which feature minimal ingredients for cats with allergies. Natural Balance produces grain-free natural cat food in dry and wet varieties for felines with food sensitivities. 

Wet cat food is great for the classy kitty who demands meals packed with flavor. Fancy Feast offers a variety of canned cat food recipes like poultry and beef, seafood feast and chicken feast. Chewy also carries several dry cat food brands, great for the kitty who likes to nibble throughout the day. 
When it comes to rewarding your pet, picking the right treat matters. Chewy offers the top cat treat brands like Greenies, Temptations and Friskies. If your cat’s in need of some tender love and dental care, look to Greenies for a healthy kitty snack. Feline Greenies are specifically designed to help remove plaque buildup while your cat chews. Whether it’s meal time or snack time, treat your kitty to meals they’ll love from Chewy today!

Cat Food
Whether your feline friend is sitting down to a meal or enjoying a kitty snack, ensure they’re getting the nutrients they need, and the flavor they deserve with the top cat food and treats. Chewy carries only the best cat food brands, making shopping for your feline’s food easier than ever. Chewy carries cat food brands your cuddly kitty will love like Fancy Feast, Friskies & Royal Canin. A balanced diet is vital to the overall health of your courageous cat, but every cat has different needs and tastes. Cat food comes in a variety of textures, ingredients and flavors. There are also healthy cat food brands that offer recipes that help address health concerns like urinary tract health, allergies, digestive health and more. 

Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO cat food comes in wet and dry varieties, and helps promote urinary tract health. Urinary crystals and stones are often linked to this disease, but the most common cause of lower urinary tract disease is idiopathic cystitis. Wet and dry cat food that promotes urinary health can help dissolve pure struvite uroliths, and help prevent struvite, calcium oxalate and phosphate uroliths. Looking for natural cat food? Chewy carries natural cat food brands like Cat Chow and Natural Balance, which feature minimal ingredients for cats with allergies. Natural Balance produces grain-free natural cat food in dry and wet varieties for felines with food sensitivities. 

Wet cat food is great for the classy kitty who demands meals packed with flavor. Fancy Feast offers a variety of canned cat food recipes like poultry and beef, seafood feast and chicken feast. Chewy also carries several dry cat food brands, great for the kitty who likes to nibble throughout the day. 
When it comes to rewarding your pet, picking the right treat matters. Chewy offers the top cat treat brands like Greenies, Temptations and Friskies. If your cat’s in need of some tender love and dental care, look to Greenies for a healthy kitty snack. Feline Greenies are specifically designed to help remove plaque buildup while your cat chews. Whether it’s meal time or snack time, treat your kitty to meals they’ll love from Chewy today!

Central Garden & Pet Co. Appoints CFO By Pet Product News Staff 
 


Published: 2017.05.23 09:00 AM




Central Garden & Pet Co. has appointed Nicholas “Niko” Lahanas as its chief financial officer.
Lahanas has worked at Central Garden & Pet for more than 10 years, holding a variety of finance positions within the company. He most recently served as senior vice president of finance, operations management and reporting and CFO of Central’s pet segment. Formerly he held positions as vice president of corporate financial planning and analysis, and director of business performance, focusing on business unit profitability. Prior to joining Central, Niko worked in private equity and investment banking for more than eight years. 
Lahanas will report to president and CEO George Roeth. “Niko is a proven leader who has been a valuable asset to the organization in helping it evolve and grow over the last ten years,” said Roeth. “His experience in many financial, strategic and operating aspects of the organization will be invaluable as Central seeks to continue its strong performance in the years ahead.”

HR couldn't care less about the "little" people.Advice to ManagementHold on to long-term employees who have knowledge, skill, dedication, and who show up every day to do the best job they can to make your company what it is. Also, allow people to evaluate their bosses, as it is sooooo one-sided for bosses to be the only ones to do the evaluating.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Central Garden & Pet Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Central Garden & Pet 2017-07-26 10:05 PDT Jul 8, 2017"Great company to work for"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Central Garden & Pet full-timeProsI really like CG&P.

Verbal abuse has been allowed to where management will publicly humiliate persons in front of their peers and then later buy them lunch or coffee to make up for it which compares to being in an abusive relationship. Management only cares for their own, not for the 'peons'. Raises are ridiculous when you compare them to other companies. Restaurants and retail positions offer better raises. A 1% to (maybe) 2% a year raise increase is insulting! If there is any one company that encourages you to go and work for a different employer it is Central Garden & Pet. I worked there for over 3 years and, in the department that I worked for, there was a not a single person who gave a 2 weeks notice because they wanted to leave in a fashion that reflected the way that they were treated.Advice to ManagementListen to your employees, fight for ways to make them happy, don't suppress people for who they are, and don't act like you care for others when all you care about is making yourself look good.

Central Garden & Pet Acquires K&H Manufacturing By Pet Product News Staff 
 


Published: 2017.05.03 11:02 AM




Central Garden & Pet Co. has purchased K&H Manufacturing, a producer of premium pet supplies and the largest marketer of heated pet products in the country. K&H sells branded pet products under the K&H and K&H Pets brands.
K&H produces pet products that span several categories, including dog and cat, small animal, and farm and ranch. In business for 20 years, K&H’s patented heating products, as well as products with cooling and other thermal properties, are a strong strategic fit with Central’s existing pet portfolio. The purchase will enable Central to offer an even broader variety of products and continued service excellence to all of Central’s customers.
“K&H has exhibited an excellent history of growth, and we are excited to work with the K&H management team, who will be staying with the business, to help it continue to flourish in the years ahead," said George Roeth, president and CEO of Central Garden & Pet. “Central and K&H have a shared passion for bringing consumers high quality, innovative, value-added products that help pet owners give their pets a more comfortable and caring environment. Together, we can continue to grow the category and develop exciting new products.”

Dog Food
Your four-legged friend rewards you in many ways. Whether it’s accompanying you on a brisk jog to help you stay in shape, or giving you a cuddle when you need it most, there’s no denying how rewarding a pup can be. Show your appreciation and reward your furry friend with the foods and treats they crave. 

Chewy carries a wide range of delicious dog foods and tasty treats for your precious pup. When it comes to choosing a dog food, you may find all the options overwhelming. Let us help you find the best one with dog food reviews, ingredient information, and personal one-on-one attention when you give us a call at 1-800-672-4399. At Chewy we understand the important role dog food plays. Most of the nutrients your dog needs to stay strong and healthy comes from the food they eat. Chewy carries healthy dog food brands like Blue Buffalo, Royal Canin and Hill’s Prescription Diet. We even carry grain-free and limited ingredient diet dog foods for pups with food allergies or sensitivities. 

Dry dog food is great for the pup parent who is away all day. Dry dog kibble can be left out for your canine companion to snack on throughout the day without spoiling. Dry kibble can also be good for your dog’s teeth -crunchy kibble helps pups get rid of pesky plaque and tartar. Wet dog food often contains flavors and ingredients canines love. Freeze-dried dog food is another option, the limited ingredients in freeze-dried dog food varieties makes it great for pups with sensitive stomachs or food allergies. And you may also consider feeding your pup dehydrated dog food. Dehydrated dog food is created by taking the whole foods found in a raw doggie diet, and slowly heating them until they’re dehydrated. An added bonus: Dehydrated dog food is easy to transport for pup parents who are on the go. And, raw and frozen dog food is another great option. These doggie meals offer your pet the nutrition he was meant to consume in the wild and are rich in protein and typically contain less additives. Whether it’s dry kibble your dog desires or a grain-free wet meal your canine craves, you can find the best dog food brands on Chewy to please his palate and his nutritional needs.

Cat Food
Whether your feline friend is sitting down to a meal or enjoying a kitty snack, ensure they’re getting the nutrients they need, and the flavor they deserve with the top cat food and treats. Chewy carries only the best cat food brands, making shopping for your feline’s food easier than ever. Chewy carries cat food brands your cuddly kitty will love like Fancy Feast, Friskies & Royal Canin. A balanced diet is vital to the overall health of your courageous cat, but every cat has different needs and tastes. Cat food comes in a variety of textures, ingredients and flavors. There are also healthy cat food brands that offer recipes that help address health concerns like urinary tract health, allergies, digestive health and more. 

Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO cat food comes in wet and dry varieties, and helps promote urinary tract health. Urinary crystals and stones are often linked to this disease, but the most common cause of lower urinary tract disease is idiopathic cystitis. Wet and dry cat food that promotes urinary health can help dissolve pure struvite uroliths, and help prevent struvite, calcium oxalate and phosphate uroliths. Looking for natural cat food? Chewy carries natural cat food brands like Cat Chow and Natural Balance, which feature minimal ingredients for cats with allergies. Natural Balance produces grain-free natural cat food in dry and wet varieties for felines with food sensitivities. 

Wet cat food is great for the classy kitty who demands meals packed with flavor. Fancy Feast offers a variety of canned cat food recipes like poultry and beef, seafood feast and chicken feast. Chewy also carries several dry cat food brands, great for the kitty who likes to nibble throughout the day. 
When it comes to rewarding your pet, picking the right treat matters. Chewy offers the top cat treat brands like Greenies, Temptations and Friskies. If your cat’s in need of some tender love and dental care, look to Greenies for a healthy kitty snack. Feline Greenies are specifically designed to help remove plaque buildup while your cat chews. Whether it’s meal time or snack time, treat your kitty to meals they’ll love from Chewy today!

A balanced diet is vital to the overall health of your courageous cat, but every cat has different needs and tastes. Cat food comes in a variety of textures, ingredients and flavors. There are also healthy cat food brands that offer recipes that help address health concerns like urinary tract health, allergies, digestive health and more. 

Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO cat food comes in wet and dry varieties, and helps promote urinary tract health. Urinary crystals and stones are often linked to this disease, but the most common cause of lower urinary tract disease is idiopathic cystitis. Wet and dry cat food that promotes urinary health can help dissolve pure struvite uroliths, and help prevent struvite, calcium oxalate and phosphate uroliths. Looking for natural cat food? Chewy carries natural cat food brands like Cat Chow and Natural Balance, which feature minimal ingredients for cats with allergies. Natural Balance produces grain-free natural cat food in dry and wet varieties for felines with food sensitivities. 

Wet cat food is great for the classy kitty who demands meals packed with flavor. Fancy Feast offers a variety of canned cat food recipes like poultry and beef, seafood feast and chicken feast. Chewy also carries several dry cat food brands, great for the kitty who likes to nibble throughout the day. 
When it comes to rewarding your pet, picking the right treat matters. Chewy offers the top cat treat brands like Greenies, Temptations and Friskies. If your cat’s in need of some tender love and dental care, look to Greenies for a healthy kitty snack. Feline Greenies are specifically designed to help remove plaque buildup while your cat chews. Whether it’s meal time or snack time, treat your kitty to meals they’ll love from Chewy today!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
