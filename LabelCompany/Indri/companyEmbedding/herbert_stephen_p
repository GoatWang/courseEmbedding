During August 1999, Mr. Herbert was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. On October 5, 2011, Mr. Herbert was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and on November 30, 2011, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Prior to joining us and since 1986, Mr. Herbert had been employed by Pepsi-Cola, the beverage division of PepsiCo, Inc. From 1994 to April 1996, Mr. Herbert was a Manager of Market Strategy. In such position he was responsible for directing development of market strategy for the vending channel and subsequently the supermarket channel for Pepsi-Cola in North America. Prior thereto, Mr. Herbert held various sales and management positions with Pepsi-Cola. Mr. Herbert graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Louisiana State University. We believe Mr. Herbert's position as the President and Chief Operating Officer of our Company until October 5, 2011 and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company thereafter, his intimate knowledge and experience with all aspects of our Company, and his extensive vending experience at PepsiCo before joining our Company provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experiences to serve on our Board of Directors.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
