PONTE VEDRA, Fla., May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. ("Advanced Disposal") announced today that UBS Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank Securities and Morgan Stanley, as representatives of the underwriters of Advanced Disposal's secondary public offering of its common stock, have exercised in full the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,325,000 shares of Advanced Disposal's common stock from certain stockholders of Advanced Disposal (the "Selling Stockholders") at the public offering price of $21.50 per share less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The closing of the sale of additional shares is expected to occur on May 23, 2017. Advanced Disposal is not selling any stock in this transaction and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Selling Stockholders.








UBS Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank Securities and Morgan Stanley acted as lead joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the offering. Macquarie Capital also acted as a lead joint book-running manager. BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Stifel acted as joint book-running managers, and First Analysis Securities Corporation acted as co-manager.
The offering of these securities was made only by means of a prospectus.  Copies of the prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from UBS Securities LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019 or by telephone at 1-888-827-7275; from Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Attention: Prospectus Group, 60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005-2836, by email to prospectus.cpdg@db.com, or by telephone at (800) 503-4611; or from Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Attn: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10014.
A registration statement relating to these securities was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2017.  This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any such offer or solicitation or any sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains a number of forward-looking statements.  Words, and variations of words such as "believe," "expect," "plan," "continue," "will," "should," and similar expressions are intended to identify our forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, risks related to the capital markets.  For additional information on these and other factors that could affect our forward-looking statements, see our risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our registration statement on Form S-3, as amended from time to time.  We disclaim and do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

PONTE VEDRA, Fla., Oct. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. ("Advanced Disposal") (NYSE:    ADSW) announced today that it has priced its previously announced private offering of $425 million aggregate principal amount of its 5⅝% Senior Notes due 2024 (the "Senior Notes"). The offering was conducted pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and is expected to close on or about November 10, 2016, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.








Advanced Disposal intends to use the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under its previously announced proposed new Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to (i) repay all outstanding indebtedness under its existing credit agreement, (ii) finance a tender offer for $550 million aggregate principal amount of Advanced Disposal's 8¼% Senior Notes due 2020, (iii) pay tender premiums and transaction fees and expenses and (iv) for general corporate purposes, to the extent proceeds remain.
The Senior Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the sellers of the Senior Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
