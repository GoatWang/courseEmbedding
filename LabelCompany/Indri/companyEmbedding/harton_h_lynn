Developing Rational Policies for Letters of Credit 
By Harton, H. Lynn

Article excerpt

  Letters of credit (L/Cs) have been an integral part of commercial business transactions for hundreds of years. Yet, owing to their detailed documentation requirements, L/Cs have typically been handled by specialists in the banking industry, leaving account officers somewhat in the dark regarding the mystery of L/Cs.    In reality, account officers are the best people to prospect for L/C opportunities and to manage the risk in existing and prospective L/C transactions. By developing and communicating rational policies concerning the use of L/Cs, banks can help account officers be more effective with this important bank product line.    A letter of credit (L/C) involves at least three parties: a bank (the issuing bank), a customer on whose behalf the L/C is issued (the applicant), and a person to whom payment from the L/C will flow (the beneficiary). L/Cs are written instruments issued by banks stating that payments will be made on behalf of applicants to beneficiaries, provided that the beneficiary fulfills all the conditions described in the instrument. In essence, the effect of an L/C is to substitute the credit of a bank, which is generally well known, for the credit of an applicant, which is either not as well known or not considered to be adequate by the beneficiary.    In issuing the L/C, the bank becomes entitled to reimbursement from the applicant for any payments that the bank properly makes. The applicant may provide collateral to the bank to secure the repayment of the reimbursement obligation, or the bank may simply rely on the applicant's promise to pay. The bank receives fees for issuing and handling L/Cs.       Principle of Independence    As professionals, bankers have a duty to protect not only the interest of their banks but also their customers' interests. Applicants are often unaware of the risk undertaken when they apply for an L/C.    Applicants must be made aware that the relationship between an issuing bank and the beneficiary is an entirely separate contractual relationship, unlike that between the applicant and the beneficiary. The bank deals in documents only (not merchandise or performance), and it therefore cannot ensure that the underlying transaction has been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the applicant. When all stipulated documents are presented, the issuing bank must pay the beneficiary.    The applicant must not rely on the L/C for protection from the beneficiary's performance problems. The bank's responsibility is only to examine documents with reasonable care and to ascertain that they appear to comply with the requirements of the L/C. Once the L/C is issued, the applicant faces the risk that the L/C may be paid through fraudulent actions of the beneficiary.    Another aspect of the independence of the relationships of the three parties involved relates to amendments of the L/C. Proposed amendments must be acceptable to all parties (issuer, applicant, and beneficiary) to be considered in effect. No party has the power to make unilateral changes in the terms of an irrevocable L/C.       Two Categories    L/Cs issued by my bank fall into two broad categories - commercial (trade-related) and standby.       Commercial L/Cs    Commercial, or trade-related, L/Cs are used to carry out specific trade transactions involving the sale or purchase of goods. Sellers of goods desire to know that if they perform according to the terms of their agreement with the purchaser (that is, deliver the product), they will be paid. The presence of the L/C from a financially strong third party gives the seller (beneficiary) that assurance. By providing this assurance to the beneficiary, the bank obviously assumes credit risk.    As previously mentioned, L/Cs rely on documents, not verified performance. For a beneficiary to claim payment under an L/C, the beneficiary's documents must conform exactly to those required by the L/C. …

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
