Early life[edit]
Demchak has a Bachelor of Science from Allegheny College and an MBA (with an emphasis in accounting) from the University of Michigan.[1] At Allegheny, he was an Alden Scholar, actively participating in student government, the economics club, the Interfraternity Council, intramural sports, and Lacrosse. In addition, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society.[2]
Career[edit]
Before PNC, Demchak held a variety of key executive positions at JP Morgan Chase. This includes: Global Head of Structured Finance and Credit Portfolio, involved in strategic agenda (before the JP Morgan-Chase Manhattan merger), member of the Board of Directors. He says JPMorgan Chase “wasn’t a terribly enjoyable place to work.”[3] He was also a Director of Hilliard Lyons Research Advisors.
In 2002, Demchak first joined PNC as Chief Financial Officer. At that time he worked alongside the then CEO, Jim Rohr. Three years later, he was promoted to head of the company’s Corporate & Institutional Banking, in charge of PNC's middle market and large corporate businesses, capital markets, real estate finance, equity management and leasing. In 2009, Demchak became Senior Vice Chairman and shortly there after Head of PNC Businesses.
William S. Demchak was elected president in April 2012, then chief executive officer in April 2013 and finally chairman in April 2014. In this capacity he is responsible for all of PNC’s businesses, including corporate and institutional banking, retail banking, mortgage banking and the Asset Management Group.[4]
His total calculated compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was $11,337,904.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Demchak was born and raised and still today, lives in Pittsburgh. He says there is "nowhere else I’d want to raise my family." He is married to Debbie and they have three children.[6]
He formerly sat on: the Regulatory Management Committee of The Financial Services Roundtable, the Supervisory Board of The Clearing House, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, Extra Mile Education Foundation, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, the Young Men’s Christian Association,[7] the YMCA of Pittsburgh and the Greater Pittsburgh Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the latter of which he in the past, held the role of chairman.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Demchak, one key ingredient to becoming a successful leader is to believe you can always be better. He advises potential leaders to: “learn from your failures, surround yourself with people who will challenge you. Ensure your vision is shared ‘clearly and often’ with your team. Remain grounded in your values so that you never forget who you serve or why you come to work.”
Of this specific work he has done and continues to do at PNC he says: “Unlike every bank in our position in history we’re not going to jump into capital markets.”[8]
Acclaim[edit]
According to Blythe Masters, Head of Global Commodities at JPMorgan Chase who worked with Demchak, “he changed the way the bank and our clients managed credit exposure.” Rohr said his candor “earned him the trust of employees and investors.”[9] And at the time of his appointment described him as being “well prepared to lead PNC and to execute the winning strategy he helped develop over the past decade. PNC's customers, shareholders, employees and community will benefit from his vision and commitment to serving their needs.”[10]
Dean of the Tepper School of Business and Professor of Finance, Robert M. Dammon, said “he has earned a high-level of respect throughout the financial community and his leadership has been an example of stability and forward-thinking amidst challenging economic conditions. Since taking office at his current post, he has advanced PNC’s outstanding relationship with our school — furthering cutting-edge research that will help to develop and improve banking services for future consumers.”[11]
Demchak is also active in humanitarian work: he is a member of Activate Pittsburgh (a campaign against weight gain and poor health), and a founder of a PNC Bank sponsored campaign to support underprivileged children in the area.

Early life[edit]
Demchak has a Bachelor of Science from Allegheny College and an MBA (with an emphasis in accounting) from the University of Michigan.[1] At Allegheny, he was an Alden Scholar, actively participating in student government, the economics club, the Interfraternity Council, intramural sports, and Lacrosse. In addition, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society.[2]
Career[edit]
Before PNC, Demchak held a variety of key executive positions at JP Morgan Chase. This includes: Global Head of Structured Finance and Credit Portfolio, involved in strategic agenda (before the JP Morgan-Chase Manhattan merger), member of the Board of Directors. He says JPMorgan Chase “wasn’t a terribly enjoyable place to work.”[3] He was also a Director of Hilliard Lyons Research Advisors.
In 2002, Demchak first joined PNC as Chief Financial Officer. At that time he worked alongside the then CEO, Jim Rohr. Three years later, he was promoted to head of the company’s Corporate & Institutional Banking, in charge of PNC's middle market and large corporate businesses, capital markets, real estate finance, equity management and leasing. In 2009, Demchak became Senior Vice Chairman and shortly there after Head of PNC Businesses.
William S. Demchak was elected president in April 2012, then chief executive officer in April 2013 and finally chairman in April 2014. In this capacity he is responsible for all of PNC’s businesses, including corporate and institutional banking, retail banking, mortgage banking and the Asset Management Group.[4]
His total calculated compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was $11,337,904.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Demchak was born and raised and still today, lives in Pittsburgh. He says there is "nowhere else I’d want to raise my family." He is married to Debbie and they have three children.[6]
He formerly sat on: the Regulatory Management Committee of The Financial Services Roundtable, the Supervisory Board of The Clearing House, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, Extra Mile Education Foundation, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, the Young Men’s Christian Association,[7] the YMCA of Pittsburgh and the Greater Pittsburgh Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the latter of which he in the past, held the role of chairman.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Demchak, one key ingredient to becoming a successful leader is to believe you can always be better. He advises potential leaders to: “learn from your failures, surround yourself with people who will challenge you. Ensure your vision is shared ‘clearly and often’ with your team. Remain grounded in your values so that you never forget who you serve or why you come to work.”
Of this specific work he has done and continues to do at PNC he says: “Unlike every bank in our position in history we’re not going to jump into capital markets.”[8]
Acclaim[edit]
According to Blythe Masters, Head of Global Commodities at JPMorgan Chase who worked with Demchak, “he changed the way the bank and our clients managed credit exposure.” Rohr said his candor “earned him the trust of employees and investors.”[9] And at the time of his appointment described him as being “well prepared to lead PNC and to execute the winning strategy he helped develop over the past decade. PNC's customers, shareholders, employees and community will benefit from his vision and commitment to serving their needs.”[10]
Dean of the Tepper School of Business and Professor of Finance, Robert M. Dammon, said “he has earned a high-level of respect throughout the financial community and his leadership has been an example of stability and forward-thinking amidst challenging economic conditions. Since taking office at his current post, he has advanced PNC’s outstanding relationship with our school — furthering cutting-edge research that will help to develop and improve banking services for future consumers.”[11]
Demchak is also active in humanitarian work: he is a member of Activate Pittsburgh (a campaign against weight gain and poor health), and a founder of a PNC Bank sponsored campaign to support underprivileged children in the area.

William S. Demchak Succeeds James E. Rohr as PNC Chairman

		  Shareholders elect directors at PNC Annual Meeting
		

Apr 22, 2014, 13:25 ET
		  		  							
						 from   PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


PITTSBURGH, April 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:   PNC) board of directors has elected William S. Demchak its chairman effective today. Demchak succeeds James E. Rohr, who announced his retirement plans in February 2013. 
Demchak is now chairman, president and chief executive officer of PNC. He was named chief executive officer in April 2013 upon Rohr's retirement from that position, and he has held the title of president since April 2012. He joined PNC in 2002 as chief financial officer.
Rohr, who joined PNC through its management development program in 1972, also left the board today. His retirement marked 42 years with the company, including 13 years as chief executive officer and chairman.
The board's vote followed today's Annual Meeting in Tampa, Fla. At the meeting, shareholders elected all 15 nominees for the board of directors. Each nominee is a current director. 
Shareholders also ratified the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as PNC's independent registered public accounting firm for 2014, approved an advisory resolution on executive compensation and rejected a shareholder proposal.  These results are unofficial until verified by the judge of elections.  PNC will file the official vote totals as a current report with the Securities and Exchange Commission when these become available.   
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (www.pnc.com) is one of the United States' largest diversified financial services organizations providing retail and business banking; residential mortgage banking; specialized services for corporations and government entities, including corporate banking, real estate finance and asset-based lending; wealth management and asset management.

William S. Demchak

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

William S. Demchak (born 1963) is a business executive in the finance industry as the current Chief executive officer of PNC Financial Services.

Early life[edit]
Demchak has a Bachelor of Science from Allegheny College and an MBA (with an emphasis in accounting) from the University of Michigan.[1] At Allegheny, he was an Alden Scholar, actively participating in student government, the economics club, the Interfraternity Council, intramural sports, and Lacrosse. In addition, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society.[2]
Career[edit]
Before PNC, Demchak held a variety of key executive positions at JP Morgan Chase. This includes: Global Head of Structured Finance and Credit Portfolio, involved in strategic agenda (before the JP Morgan-Chase Manhattan merger), member of the Board of Directors. He says JPMorgan Chase “wasn’t a terribly enjoyable place to work.”[3] He was also a Director of Hilliard Lyons Research Advisors.
In 2002, Demchak first joined PNC as Chief Financial Officer. At that time he worked alongside the then CEO, Jim Rohr. Three years later, he was promoted to head of the company’s Corporate & Institutional Banking, in charge of PNC's middle market and large corporate businesses, capital markets, real estate finance, equity management and leasing. In 2009, Demchak became Senior Vice Chairman and shortly there after Head of PNC Businesses.
William S. Demchak was elected president in April 2012, then chief executive officer in April 2013 and finally chairman in April 2014. In this capacity he is responsible for all of PNC’s businesses, including corporate and institutional banking, retail banking, mortgage banking and the Asset Management Group.[4]
His total calculated compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was $11,337,904.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Demchak was born and raised and still today, lives in Pittsburgh. He says there is "nowhere else I’d want to raise my family." He is married to Debbie and they have three children.[6]
He formerly sat on: the Regulatory Management Committee of The Financial Services Roundtable, the Supervisory Board of The Clearing House, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, Extra Mile Education Foundation, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, the Young Men’s Christian Association,[7] the YMCA of Pittsburgh and the Greater Pittsburgh Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the latter of which he in the past, held the role of chairman.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Demchak, one key ingredient to becoming a successful leader is to believe you can always be better. He advises potential leaders to: “learn from your failures, surround yourself with people who will challenge you. Ensure your vision is shared ‘clearly and often’ with your team. Remain grounded in your values so that you never forget who you serve or why you come to work.”
Of this specific work he has done and continues to do at PNC he says: “Unlike every bank in our position in history we’re not going to jump into capital markets.”[8]
Acclaim[edit]
According to Blythe Masters, Head of Global Commodities at JPMorgan Chase who worked with Demchak, “he changed the way the bank and our clients managed credit exposure.” Rohr said his candor “earned him the trust of employees and investors.”[9] And at the time of his appointment described him as being “well prepared to lead PNC and to execute the winning strategy he helped develop over the past decade. PNC's customers, shareholders, employees and community will benefit from his vision and commitment to serving their needs.”[10]
Dean of the Tepper School of Business and Professor of Finance, Robert M. Dammon, said “he has earned a high-level of respect throughout the financial community and his leadership has been an example of stability and forward-thinking amidst challenging economic conditions. Since taking office at his current post, he has advanced PNC’s outstanding relationship with our school — furthering cutting-edge research that will help to develop and improve banking services for future consumers.”[11]
Demchak is also active in humanitarian work: he is a member of Activate Pittsburgh (a campaign against weight gain and poor health), and a founder of a PNC Bank sponsored campaign to support underprivileged children in the area.

Of this specific work he has done and continues to do at PNC he says: “Unlike every bank in our position in history we’re not going to jump into capital markets.”[8]
Acclaim[edit]
According to Blythe Masters, Head of Global Commodities at JPMorgan Chase who worked with Demchak, “he changed the way the bank and our clients managed credit exposure.” Rohr said his candor “earned him the trust of employees and investors.”[9] And at the time of his appointment described him as being “well prepared to lead PNC and to execute the winning strategy he helped develop over the past decade. PNC's customers, shareholders, employees and community will benefit from his vision and commitment to serving their needs.”[10]
Dean of the Tepper School of Business and Professor of Finance, Robert M. Dammon, said “he has earned a high-level of respect throughout the financial community and his leadership has been an example of stability and forward-thinking amidst challenging economic conditions. Since taking office at his current post, he has advanced PNC’s outstanding relationship with our school — furthering cutting-edge research that will help to develop and improve banking services for future consumers.”[11]
Demchak is also active in humanitarian work: he is a member of Activate Pittsburgh (a campaign against weight gain and poor health), and a founder of a PNC Bank sponsored campaign to support underprivileged children in the area.

Early life[edit]
Demchak has a Bachelor of Science from Allegheny College and an MBA (with an emphasis in accounting) from the University of Michigan.[1] At Allegheny, he was an Alden Scholar, actively participating in student government, the economics club, the Interfraternity Council, intramural sports, and Lacrosse. In addition, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society.[2]
Career[edit]
Before PNC, Demchak held a variety of key executive positions at JP Morgan Chase. This includes: Global Head of Structured Finance and Credit Portfolio, involved in strategic agenda (before the JP Morgan-Chase Manhattan merger), member of the Board of Directors. He says JPMorgan Chase “wasn’t a terribly enjoyable place to work.”[3] He was also a Director of Hilliard Lyons Research Advisors.
In 2002, Demchak first joined PNC as Chief Financial Officer. At that time he worked alongside the then CEO, Jim Rohr. Three years later, he was promoted to head of the company’s Corporate & Institutional Banking, in charge of PNC's middle market and large corporate businesses, capital markets, real estate finance, equity management and leasing. In 2009, Demchak became Senior Vice Chairman and shortly there after Head of PNC Businesses.
William S. Demchak was elected president in April 2012, then chief executive officer in April 2013 and finally chairman in April 2014. In this capacity he is responsible for all of PNC’s businesses, including corporate and institutional banking, retail banking, mortgage banking and the Asset Management Group.[4]
His total calculated compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was $11,337,904.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Demchak was born and raised and still today, lives in Pittsburgh. He says there is "nowhere else I’d want to raise my family." He is married to Debbie and they have three children.[6]
He formerly sat on: the Regulatory Management Committee of The Financial Services Roundtable, the Supervisory Board of The Clearing House, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, Extra Mile Education Foundation, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, the Young Men’s Christian Association,[7] the YMCA of Pittsburgh and the Greater Pittsburgh Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the latter of which he in the past, held the role of chairman.
Philosophy[edit]
According to Demchak, one key ingredient to becoming a successful leader is to believe you can always be better. He advises potential leaders to: “learn from your failures, surround yourself with people who will challenge you. Ensure your vision is shared ‘clearly and often’ with your team. Remain grounded in your values so that you never forget who you serve or why you come to work.”
Of this specific work he has done and continues to do at PNC he says: “Unlike every bank in our position in history we’re not going to jump into capital markets.”[8]
Acclaim[edit]
According to Blythe Masters, Head of Global Commodities at JPMorgan Chase who worked with Demchak, “he changed the way the bank and our clients managed credit exposure.” Rohr said his candor “earned him the trust of employees and investors.”[9] And at the time of his appointment described him as being “well prepared to lead PNC and to execute the winning strategy he helped develop over the past decade.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
