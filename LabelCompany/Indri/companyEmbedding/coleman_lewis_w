Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

  LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26, 2001 (PRIMEZONE) -- Northrop Grumman Corporation 
(NYSE:NOC) announced today that Lewis W. Coleman was elected to its board of directors at its meeting held Feb. 21, increasing the board to 13 members.
 

  Mr. Coleman recently became president of the Gordon E. and Betty I. Moore Foundation in San Francisco, Calif., a newly created organization devoted to bringing measurable improvements in education, scientific research and the preservation of biodiversity.  He accepted this position following a distinguished 27-year career in the banking industry.
 

  "Lewis Coleman's strong financial background will be an asset to our board," said Kent Kresa, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Northrop Grumman.  "He will also provide strategic guidance in many key areas that are important to our continued success."
 

  Prior to his current position, he was chairman of Banc of America Securities L.L.C., a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation in San Francisco.  Mr. Coleman previously served as vice chairman of the board of directors and chief financial officer for Bank of America.  Before that, he was head of the World Banking Group, assuming that position after he earlier directed its capital markets where he was responsible for all trading activity.  He joined the bank in 1986 as chief credit officer for the group.
 

  Before joining Bank of America, he spent 13 years with Wells Fargo and Company in a variety of wholesale and retail positions, completing his career there as chairman of the credit policy committee.  Mr. Coleman earned a B.A. in economics from Stanford University.  He is also on the board of Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company.
 

  Northrop Grumman Corporation, headquartered in Los Angeles, is a world-class, high technology company providing innovative solutions in systems integration, defense electronics and information technology for its U.S. and international military, government and commercial customers, as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member or preferred supplier.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them.

						What Our Loyal Customers Have To Say					

						Just a short note to say thanks for the information and parts you provide. I have been able to resurrect and maintain a wide variety of tools thanks to the schematics and amazing array of parts you can supply.					

						Chris D.

					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.
