About Us























About Cogentix Medical

Cogentix Medical, Inc. is a global medical company that provides proprietary, innovative technologies to specialty markets including urology, gynecology, bariatric medicine, critical care, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, and pulmonology. Our products are designed to increase treatment efficiency, lower patient risk and provide customer value.
Cogentix Medical was formed in 2015 following the merger of two established medical device companies: Uroplasty, a urology company focused on bulking agents and office-based neuromodulation, and Vision-Sciences, the company that introduced an innovative sterile, sheathed-endoscope technology, which revolutionizes efficiency and safety in endoscopy.
Product Overview

Urgent® PC  Neuromodulation System

Urgent PC  Neuromodulation System is an effective, office-based method of treating overactive bladder and associated symptoms of urinary urgency, urinary frequency and urge incontinence. Urgent PC is also indicated for the treatment of fecal incontinence outside the US market.  Urgent PC is delivered in simple 30-minute treatments that are low-risk and associated with minimal side effects. Clinical trials and published studies have shown PTNS to be clinically effective in up to 80% of patients.

PrimeSight™ Endoscopy Systems

PrimeSight Endoscopy Systems from Cogentix Medical combine state-of-the-art endoscopic instrumentation with the EndoSheath® protective barrier, a sterile single-use product with an integrated working channel, to offer practitioners and healthcare facilities a solution to meet the growing need for safe, efficient, and cost effective endoscopy. Cogentix Medical offers video and fiberoptic endoscopy systems that are used in Cystoscopy, Laryngoscopy, Bronchoscopy, and Transnasal Esophagoscopy. In addition, Cogentix Medical offers a variety of endoscopy accessories.

Bulking Agents

Bulking Agents are available from Cogentix Medical to meet a variety of bulking needs. Macroplastique® is the most established product for soft tissue augmentation for the endoscopic treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI).  Other Cogentix Medical bulking agents are used in vocal cord rehabilitation and fecal incontinence.  Product availability and clearances vary by country.
Cogentix Medical currently has over forty issued patents in the United States and other key countries, and a number of additional patent applications in process. These patents, as well as additional intellectual property, provide a robust technology base for future growth.

Patients































Your health is essential. Get the support you deserve.

Cogentix Medical specializes in the treatment of incontinence and other urinary disorders.
Whether you’re a patient who is already under the care of a physician or someone who is just investigating treatment options, congratulations for taking charge of your health! While all healthcare decisions should be made in conjunction with a physician, we aim to provide helpful education on the products offered by Cogentix Medical and the conditions they treat.
Cogentix Medical’s products are used by healthcare providers to treat overactive bladder, stress urinary incontinence, and as part of procedures to diagnose and treat ailments throughout the body.
Urgent® PC is a non-drug, non-surgical treatment for Overactive Bladder and the associated symptoms of urinary urgency, urinary frequency and urge incontinence.
Macroplastique® is a urethral bulking agent that is used in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence primary due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency.
PrimeSightTM Endoscopes are thin, tube-like devices with a camera at the end that allow physicians to visualize the internal organs of the body without invasive surgical procedures. Endoscopy procedures are frequently used to help physicians visually identify issues and provide direction for future treatments. PrimeSight endoscopes are unique because they are used with the EndoSheath® protective disposable sheath that completely covers the endscope and ensures that the endoscope does not come in direct contact with the patient during the procedure. Learn more about endoscope safety.

MINNEAPOLIS, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cogentix Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:   CGNT), a global medical device company focused on providing the Urology, Uro/Gyn and Gynecology markets with innovative and proprietary products, today announced that it has acquired privately held Genesis Medical based in London, United Kingdom. The transaction is expected to generate incremental revenue to Cogentix during the second half of 2017 of approximately $0.8 million and over $2.0 million of incremental revenue in 2018.  Genesis sells and markets a variety of products to urologists within the United Kingdom and has been the exclusive U.K. distributor of Cogentix's PrimeSight™ endoscopy systems since 2013. 








"The purchase of Genesis Medical is our second business development transaction this month and follows our announcement last week of an Endo-Urology product line launch in the U.S.," said Darin Hammers, President & CEO of Cogentix.  "Genesis has been our highly productive PrimeSight partner in the U.K. for the past four years, and they have exceptionally strong customer relationships in the British urology market.  We believe that during the second half of this year our urology products revenue growth rate will exceed the first half's 11 percent and Genesis will contribute to this acceleration."  
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Cogentix has purchased the tangible assets of Genesis and will pay up to £515,000 for the ongoing business, dependent on Genesis achieving certain revenue milestones through March of 2019.  During 2016 Genesis Medical generated more than $3 million in total revenue and was profitable.
About Cogentix MedicalCogentix Medical, Inc., headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with additional operations in New York, Massachusetts, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, is a global medical device company.  We design, develop, manufacture and market products for flexible endoscopy with our unique PrimeSight™ product lines featuring a streamlined visualization system and proprietary sterile disposable microbial barrier providing users with efficient and cost effective endoscope turnover while enhancing patient safety. We also commercialize the Urgent® PC Neuromodulation System, an FDA-cleared device that delivers percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) for the office-based treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). OAB is a chronic condition that affects approximately 42 million U.S. adults. The symptoms include urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence.  We also offer Macroplastique®, an injectable urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency.

	Cogentix Medical Reports First Quarter Operating Results; Urology Revenue Up 11 Percent





	Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET






	MINNEAPOLIS, MN, May 2, 2017

	 

	– Cogentix Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CGNT), a global

	medical device company focused on providing the Urology, Uro/Gyn and Gynecology markets with innovative and proprietary products, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31

	, 2017.







	First Quarter Highlights











	·



	First quarter revenue totaled $13.0 million, including $11.5 million in Urology product revenue. Urology product revenue increased 11% over last year’s first quarter as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis.  First quarter 2017 revenue from the Company’s non-core product lines of Airway Management and Industrial decreased approximately 20% from the year ago period. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 6% year-over-year, which was an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis.











	·



	Gross profit totaled $8.5 million, an increase from $8.4 million in the year ago period due to higher sales partially offset by a lower gross margin due to product mix.











	·



	First quarter GAAP operating loss was $1.2 million compared to an operating loss of $0.6 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to business development expense incurred in the first quarter of 2017 and higher investment in research and development projects.











	·



	Cash operating loss, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash items, was $0.1 million in the first quarter, essentially break-even, compared to a cash operating profit of $0.3 million in the comparable year ago period.









	Darin Hammers, President and CEO, commented “The 11 percent year-over-year growth in our core Urology product revenue illustrates the continued successful execution of our Urology product strategies.  As expected, PrimeSight

	™

	urology products continued to lead our revenue growth with an increase of approximately 45% in the first quarter.  The average sales price for our Urgent

	®

	PC product line during the first quarter of 2017 was consistent with the pricing we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Our core Urology business is off to a great start in 2017, and we continue to execute on our business development strategy.  The addition of Ash Keswani to our team expands our business development scope as we continue to examine opportunities to expand our product offerings within Urology.  Further, we have started to explore strategic alternatives for our non-core Airway Management and Industrial product lines that have depressed our recent overall reported growth.”


	 









	Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017






	For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company had total revenue of $13.0 million compared to $12.2 million in the year ago quarter.  The nearly $0.8 million increase in reported revenue is attributable to a $1.1 million increase in Urology revenue, partially offset by an approximate $350,000 decrease in Airway Management and Industrial revenue. Revenue from PrimeSight Urology totaled $4.5 million, up $1.4 million or 45% from the comparable year-ago period. Urgent PC revenue totaled $5.0 million compared to $5.1 million in the comparable year ago period, comprised of unit growth in the US of approximately 3% offset by lower average selling prices.  Macroplastique

	®

	revenue in the quarter of $1.8 million decreased approximately $73,000 compared to the prior year period.





	Gross margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 65.3% compared with 68.9% in the year-ago period. Gross margin was impacted by the shift in product mix to a higher proportion of capital equipment sales in this year’s first quarter as compared to the year ago period. Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $9.7 million as compared to $9.0 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in operating expenses is attributable to higher G&A expenses, partly due to additional business development activities, and higher R&D expenses associated with ongoing enhancements to our endoscopy product line.






	Operating loss for the quarter was $1.2 million compared to the operating loss of $0.6 million in the year ago period. Cash operating loss, a non-GAAP financial measure which is operating profit excluding all non-cash items, was $0.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to a cash operating profit of $0.3 million in the

	year-ago quarter. Net loss was $1.2 million ($0.02 per share) in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $1.0 million ($0.04 per share) in the comparable year-ago period.





	At March 31, 2017, the Company’s cash and investments totaled $25.8 million, compared to $28.3 million at year-end 2016. T

	here were no borrowings under the Company’s $7.0 million line of credit as of March 31, 2017.

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures

	:





	The table set forth below entitled “Cash Operating Profit (Unaudited)” provides the non-GAAP cash operating profit for the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.  This table reconciles the Company’s operating income / loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Company’s cash operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash charges for share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization.





	The non-GAAP financial information used by management and disclosed by us is not a substitute for, nor superior to, financial information and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non-GAAP.  We may calculate our non-GAAP financial information differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to those used by other companies.  We have described the reconciliations of each of our non-GAAP financial information described above to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.





	We use this non-GAAP financial information, and in particular non-GAAP cash operating income / loss, for internal managerial purposes because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the operating performance of our business.  Analysts and investors frequently ask us for this information.  We believe that they use this information to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry, including as a means of comparing period-to-period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies.

	Cogentix Medical Signs Agreement to Launch Endo-Urology Product Line in US; Launch to Further Increase Urology Products Growth Rate During 2018






	MINNEAPOLIS, MN, July 18, 2017

	– Cogentix Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CGNT), a global medical device company focused on providing the Urology, Uro/Gyn and Gynecology markets with innovative and proprietary products, today announced that it has entered into an exclusive license with Promepla, a Monaco-based medical device manufacturer, to launch an Endo-Urology product line in the U.S.  The product line is a full suite of endourological devices including ureteral access sheaths, gravity irrigation lines and nitinol guide wires that are highly complementary to the Company’s current urology product portfolio and will leverage Cogentix’s high performing commercial organization.  The initial preparation for launch of the Cogentix-branded product line is underway and management expects the product line will generate revenue exceeding $2.5 million during 2018.





	“The launch of our Endo-Urology product line in the U.S. is one of the first steps in executing our business development strategy,” said Darin Hammers, President & CEO of Cogentix.  “Our primary focus for business development has been to add products that can immediately leverage the relationships our U.S. sales team has with their urology customers and the Endo-Urology product line perfectly meets this criteria.  The substantial growth we have seen in our PrimeSight™ business demonstrates what our sales team can do with new and innovative products.  This transaction is expected to further increase our strong urology product revenue growth rate, which was approximately 11 percent during the second quarter 2017.  In addition, the structure of the license agreement we have announced today means that we continue to have $27 million in cash and investments for additional business development opportunities. We expect to complete at least one more transaction in the near term.”
