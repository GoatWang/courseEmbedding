The cases (collectively, the “Bankruptcy Cases”) are being jointly administered under Case No. 16-31854 before the Honorable Judge Barbara J. Houser in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the "Bankruptcy Court").            
Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (specifically including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. § 362), a debtor is afforded certain protection against its creditors; the Bankruptcy Code prohibits creditors from taking certain actions related to debts that may have been owing prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases. If you believe that you might be a creditor of the Debtor(s) based upon debts arising prior to May 5, 2016 and you are considering taking action based upon your status as a creditor, you may wish to seek legal advice. The staff of the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court and the staff of Kurtzman Carson Consultants LLC are not permitted to give legal advice.For additional information, please contact the CHC Group toll-free information line at (866) 967-0261 or, if calling from outside the United States or Canada, at (310) 751-2661.Location to File Proof(s) of ClaimCHC Group Claims Processing Centerc/o KCC2335 Alaska AvenueEl Segundo, CA 90245
