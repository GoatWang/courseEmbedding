Houston pipeline giant says its CEO is stepping down

Posted by         Robert Grattan

Date: March 30, 2015






HOUSTON — Enterprise Products Partners CEO Michael Creel will step down at the end of the year from the top job at the Houston-based pipeline giant, the company said in a press release Monday.
The company’s board has elected Chief Operating Officer A.J. “Jim” Teague to succeed Creel.
Enterprise indicated that the decision to retire had come from Creel, but did not elaborate on his reasons. Creel, 61, has held the top job at Enterprise for almost five years.
Teague, 70, has served as  COO  since 2010. He started with Enterprise in 1999, when it purchased a Shell Oil Co. affiliate where Teague was working.
Both men have been visible leaders of the company and are paid about the same amount. In 2014,  Creel made $17.6 million in total compensation and Teague made $17.7 million, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In 2013, Creel and Teague made a respective $7.2 million and $7.1 million in total compensation.
Enterprise Products Partners is structured as a tax-advantaged master limited partnership. MLPs distribute most of their cash flow to  investors called unit holders — making the structure a good fit for midstream companies that typically operate under long-term contracts for transportation and storage services.
The collapse in oil prices has hurt midstream operators, though production and oil field services companies have taken a bigger hit.
Units of Enterprise Products Partners have fallen by about 18 percent over the past six months. The units rose 51 cents to $32.91 in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
On a previous conference call discussing the company’s fourth-quarter earnings, Teague said the environment had toughened across the industry. “It’d be nice if prices were higher and the environment was such that money was falling from the sky,” he said. “Those days are gone now.”
