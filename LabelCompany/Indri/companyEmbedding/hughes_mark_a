Early life[edit]
Mark Reynolds Hughes was born to father Stuard Hartman (not "Stuart", per birth certificate) and mother Jo Ann Hughes. His parents divorced in 1970, when Mark was 14, and his mother retained custody of Mark.
At this point, the family survived on welfare payments with Hughes' mother suffering from “emotional problems.” She battled obesity and tension via amphetamines and sleeping pills.[2] In the ninth grade Hughes dropped out of school and began using drugs himself. “I was a little delinquent,” he says. “I got in trouble with the law.”[2][3] At 16, he was sent to CEDU High School, a private residential school for troubled youngsters in Running Springs, CA whose origins went back to a cult founded in 1958.[2][4][5][6] Part of Hughes' CEDU rehab required him to raise money by selling raffle tickets. Hughes became the school’s best salesman. “The approval there was based on how much funds you raised,” Hughes told People magazine in 1985. “There was a lot of pressure, and I wanted to be the best right away.”[2]
Hughes was 19 years old and still working for CEDU when his mother died in her apartment of a accidental drug overdose on April 27, 1975.[7] According to the autopsy report, several empty vials of prescription drugs were found beside her bed, and her doctor told the coroner she "was known to over-ingest her prescription drugs."[7] Toxicological tests showed potentially lethal levels of the painkiller Darvon in her system.[8]
Pre-Herbalife career and first marriage[edit]
In 1976, the 20-year-old Hughes began selling diet products for Seyforth Laboratories, a multilevel marketer, becoming one of its top 100 earners. After Seyforth collapsed in 1979, Hughes then sold exercise equipment and weight-control products for a company called Golden Youth, also a direct-sales outfit. It was while working for Golden Youth in 1979 that Hughes met Kathryn Whiting, the first of four beauty pageant winners he would marry on the beach. Whiting, a former "Miss Santa Monica," was then a 21-year old college student pursing a degree in medical science. When Golden Youth also went out of business, Hughes decided to start his own operation.[9][2][3]
Career[edit]
In February 1980, aged 24, Hughes founded Los Angeles-based Herbalife International. It has since become one of the world's largest distributors of herbal products through multi-level marketing, with sales of about $3.5 billion in 2007 and 2.1 million Independent Distributors. Now in 91 countries and achieving record retail sales of $7.5 billion in 2013 according to company statements.[10]
In the mid-1980s, Hughes was sued by the Food and Drug Administration, the California attorney general's office, and the state Department of Health, over what they said were false health claims about Herbalife products and the various schemes used to market them.[11] Health agencies accused the company of violating labeling standards and using improper sales practices.[7]
Regulators contended that the company was making medicinal claims. Medicines are regulated by the F.D.A., while nutritional supplements are not. Some health experts doubted the efficacy of Herbalife products, saying that in some instances they relied too heavily on laxatives and caffeine.[7]
In March 1985, the California attorney general and the state Department of Health Services charged him and Herbalife with making "untrue or misleading" product claims—primarily involving the caffeine content of some Herbalife products—and operating an "endless chain marketing scheme."[7]
Prompted by complaints alleging that Herbalife product users had suffered illness and death, a U.S. Senate subcommittee called Hughes before a hearing in May. Referring to a panel of nutrition experts who had criticized Herbalife in testimony the previous day, he asked the senators, "If they're such experts in weight loss, why were they so fat?"[7]
During the hearing, Hughes acknowledged that his own formal education stopped at the 9th grade. When asked during the hearing how he could be qualified to challenge leading medical experts, Hughes responded: "I defy anybody to be able to produce results as this company has."[12]
Hughes reached settlements with the regulatory agencies in 1986. To settle his problems with the state, Hughes agreed to pay $850,000. At the time, the California attorney general, John Van De Kamp, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying it was the largest settlement ever attained from a health products company.[8]
In December 1991, Hughes' and his third wife, Suzan Hughes, had a son, Alexander Reynolds "Alex" Hughes.[13]
Death[edit]
On the night of Saturday, May 20, 2000, Hughes celebrated the 87th birthday of his maternal grandmother, Hazel (known as Mimi). It was a private gathering, with a few family members joining him at his mansion in Malibu for the evening. Out of the public limelight, Hughes drank white wine, smoked a cigar and played his drum set.
Hughes was trying to buy up all outstanding shares of Herbalife and take the company private once more. The stress and long hours had taken a toll on his health; he was recovering from a recurrence of pneumonia. The treatment involved corticosteroids, which made sleeping difficult. His physician prescribed the drug doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, for the insomnia and according to security guards at 1800 Century Park East he was found dead in his office with a pile of cocaine in front of him.
On May 21, 2000, authorities said that Mark Hughes died of an accidental overdose after mixing alcohol with a "toxic level" of antidepressants. Scott Carrier, of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, said final autopsy results found that Hughes, 44, had ingested a toxic combination of alcohol and Doxepin, an antidepressant he was taking to help him sleep.[8] His blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.21.[14]
Hughes' then 9-year-old son, Alexander "Alex" Hughes, was named sole beneficiary of his father's estate, estimated to be worth $400 million. Hughes's will stipulated that, until Alex turns 35, the bulk of his inheritance would be held in a trust managed by Hughes' father, Jack Reynolds, attorney Conrad Klein, and Herbalife executive Christopher Pair.[15][16] In 2006, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled to remove Reynolds from supervising a $35 million custodianship after finding that he violated multiple probate laws by ceding control to Klein and commingling Alex's personal assets with partnership accounts.[17] Reynolds was suspended,[17] but remained one of three trustees until 2013, when a judge in a separate lawsuit ordered the removal of all three for breaching the terms of the Trust by mismanaging the funds.[18]

In December 1991, Hughes' and his third wife, Suzan Hughes, had a son, Alexander Reynolds "Alex" Hughes.[13]
Death[edit]
On the night of Saturday, May 20, 2000, Hughes celebrated the 87th birthday of his maternal grandmother, Hazel (known as Mimi). It was a private gathering, with a few family members joining him at his mansion in Malibu for the evening. Out of the public limelight, Hughes drank white wine, smoked a cigar and played his drum set.
Hughes was trying to buy up all outstanding shares of Herbalife and take the company private once more. The stress and long hours had taken a toll on his health; he was recovering from a recurrence of pneumonia. The treatment involved corticosteroids, which made sleeping difficult. His physician prescribed the drug doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, for the insomnia and according to security guards at 1800 Century Park East he was found dead in his office with a pile of cocaine in front of him.
On May 21, 2000, authorities said that Mark Hughes died of an accidental overdose after mixing alcohol with a "toxic level" of antidepressants. Scott Carrier, of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, said final autopsy results found that Hughes, 44, had ingested a toxic combination of alcohol and Doxepin, an antidepressant he was taking to help him sleep.[8] His blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.21.[14]
Hughes' then 9-year-old son, Alexander "Alex" Hughes, was named sole beneficiary of his father's estate, estimated to be worth $400 million. Hughes's will stipulated that, until Alex turns 35, the bulk of his inheritance would be held in a trust managed by Hughes' father, Jack Reynolds, attorney Conrad Klein, and Herbalife executive Christopher Pair.[15][16] In 2006, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled to remove Reynolds from supervising a $35 million custodianship after finding that he violated multiple probate laws by ceding control to Klein and commingling Alex's personal assets with partnership accounts.[17] Reynolds was suspended,[17] but remained one of three trustees until 2013, when a judge in a separate lawsuit ordered the removal of all three for breaching the terms of the Trust by mismanaging the funds.[18]

Early life[edit]
Mark Reynolds Hughes was born to father Stuard Hartman (not "Stuart", per birth certificate) and mother Jo Ann Hughes. His parents divorced in 1970, when Mark was 14, and his mother retained custody of Mark.
At this point, the family survived on welfare payments with Hughes' mother suffering from “emotional problems.” She battled obesity and tension via amphetamines and sleeping pills.[2] In the ninth grade Hughes dropped out of school and began using drugs himself. “I was a little delinquent,” he says. “I got in trouble with the law.”[2][3] At 16, he was sent to CEDU High School, a private residential school for troubled youngsters in Running Springs, CA whose origins went back to a cult founded in 1958.[2][4][5][6] Part of Hughes' CEDU rehab required him to raise money by selling raffle tickets. Hughes became the school’s best salesman. “The approval there was based on how much funds you raised,” Hughes told People magazine in 1985. “There was a lot of pressure, and I wanted to be the best right away.”[2]
Hughes was 19 years old and still working for CEDU when his mother died in her apartment of a accidental drug overdose on April 27, 1975.[7] According to the autopsy report, several empty vials of prescription drugs were found beside her bed, and her doctor told the coroner she "was known to over-ingest her prescription drugs."[7] Toxicological tests showed potentially lethal levels of the painkiller Darvon in her system.[8]
Pre-Herbalife career and first marriage[edit]
In 1976, the 20-year-old Hughes began selling diet products for Seyforth Laboratories, a multilevel marketer, becoming one of its top 100 earners. After Seyforth collapsed in 1979, Hughes then sold exercise equipment and weight-control products for a company called Golden Youth, also a direct-sales outfit. It was while working for Golden Youth in 1979 that Hughes met Kathryn Whiting, the first of four beauty pageant winners he would marry on the beach. Whiting, a former "Miss Santa Monica," was then a 21-year old college student pursing a degree in medical science. When Golden Youth also went out of business, Hughes decided to start his own operation.[9][2][3]
Career[edit]
In February 1980, aged 24, Hughes founded Los Angeles-based Herbalife International. It has since become one of the world's largest distributors of herbal products through multi-level marketing, with sales of about $3.5 billion in 2007 and 2.1 million Independent Distributors. Now in 91 countries and achieving record retail sales of $7.5 billion in 2013 according to company statements.[10]
In the mid-1980s, Hughes was sued by the Food and Drug Administration, the California attorney general's office, and the state Department of Health, over what they said were false health claims about Herbalife products and the various schemes used to market them.[11] Health agencies accused the company of violating labeling standards and using improper sales practices.[7]
Regulators contended that the company was making medicinal claims. Medicines are regulated by the F.D.A., while nutritional supplements are not. Some health experts doubted the efficacy of Herbalife products, saying that in some instances they relied too heavily on laxatives and caffeine.[7]
In March 1985, the California attorney general and the state Department of Health Services charged him and Herbalife with making "untrue or misleading" product claims—primarily involving the caffeine content of some Herbalife products—and operating an "endless chain marketing scheme."[7]
Prompted by complaints alleging that Herbalife product users had suffered illness and death, a U.S. Senate subcommittee called Hughes before a hearing in May. Referring to a panel of nutrition experts who had criticized Herbalife in testimony the previous day, he asked the senators, "If they're such experts in weight loss, why were they so fat?"[7]
During the hearing, Hughes acknowledged that his own formal education stopped at the 9th grade. When asked during the hearing how he could be qualified to challenge leading medical experts, Hughes responded: "I defy anybody to be able to produce results as this company has."[12]
Hughes reached settlements with the regulatory agencies in 1986. To settle his problems with the state, Hughes agreed to pay $850,000. At the time, the California attorney general, John Van De Kamp, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying it was the largest settlement ever attained from a health products company.[8]
In December 1991, Hughes' and his third wife, Suzan Hughes, had a son, Alexander Reynolds "Alex" Hughes.[13]
Death[edit]
On the night of Saturday, May 20, 2000, Hughes celebrated the 87th birthday of his maternal grandmother, Hazel (known as Mimi). It was a private gathering, with a few family members joining him at his mansion in Malibu for the evening. Out of the public limelight, Hughes drank white wine, smoked a cigar and played his drum set.
Hughes was trying to buy up all outstanding shares of Herbalife and take the company private once more. The stress and long hours had taken a toll on his health; he was recovering from a recurrence of pneumonia. The treatment involved corticosteroids, which made sleeping difficult. His physician prescribed the drug doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, for the insomnia and according to security guards at 1800 Century Park East he was found dead in his office with a pile of cocaine in front of him.
On May 21, 2000, authorities said that Mark Hughes died of an accidental overdose after mixing alcohol with a "toxic level" of antidepressants. Scott Carrier, of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, said final autopsy results found that Hughes, 44, had ingested a toxic combination of alcohol and Doxepin, an antidepressant he was taking to help him sleep.[8] His blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.21.[14]
Hughes' then 9-year-old son, Alexander "Alex" Hughes, was named sole beneficiary of his father's estate, estimated to be worth $400 million. Hughes's will stipulated that, until Alex turns 35, the bulk of his inheritance would be held in a trust managed by Hughes' father, Jack Reynolds, attorney Conrad Klein, and Herbalife executive Christopher Pair.[15][16] In 2006, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled to remove Reynolds from supervising a $35 million custodianship after finding that he violated multiple probate laws by ceding control to Klein and commingling Alex's personal assets with partnership accounts.[17] Reynolds was suspended,[17] but remained one of three trustees until 2013, when a judge in a separate lawsuit ordered the removal of all three for breaching the terms of the Trust by mismanaging the funds.[18]

Mark Reynolds Hughes (January 1, 1956 – May 21, 2000) was an American businessman who was the founder, chairman and CEO of Herbalife International Ltd, a multi-level marketing company.
Hughes was born in Los Angeles County, California USA in 1956. While being treated for drinking problems, Hughes died at age 44 after ingesting a toxic combination of alcohol and doxepin, an antidepressant, in his Malibu mansion.[1]

Early life[edit]
Mark Reynolds Hughes was born to father Stuard Hartman (not "Stuart", per birth certificate) and mother Jo Ann Hughes. His parents divorced in 1970, when Mark was 14, and his mother retained custody of Mark.
At this point, the family survived on welfare payments with Hughes' mother suffering from “emotional problems.” She battled obesity and tension via amphetamines and sleeping pills.[2] In the ninth grade Hughes dropped out of school and began using drugs himself. “I was a little delinquent,” he says. “I got in trouble with the law.”[2][3] At 16, he was sent to CEDU High School, a private residential school for troubled youngsters in Running Springs, CA whose origins went back to a cult founded in 1958.[2][4][5][6] Part of Hughes' CEDU rehab required him to raise money by selling raffle tickets. Hughes became the school’s best salesman. “The approval there was based on how much funds you raised,” Hughes told People magazine in 1985. “There was a lot of pressure, and I wanted to be the best right away.”[2]
Hughes was 19 years old and still working for CEDU when his mother died in her apartment of a accidental drug overdose on April 27, 1975.[7] According to the autopsy report, several empty vials of prescription drugs were found beside her bed, and her doctor told the coroner she "was known to over-ingest her prescription drugs."[7] Toxicological tests showed potentially lethal levels of the painkiller Darvon in her system.[8]
Pre-Herbalife career and first marriage[edit]
In 1976, the 20-year-old Hughes began selling diet products for Seyforth Laboratories, a multilevel marketer, becoming one of its top 100 earners. After Seyforth collapsed in 1979, Hughes then sold exercise equipment and weight-control products for a company called Golden Youth, also a direct-sales outfit. It was while working for Golden Youth in 1979 that Hughes met Kathryn Whiting, the first of four beauty pageant winners he would marry on the beach. Whiting, a former "Miss Santa Monica," was then a 21-year old college student pursing a degree in medical science. When Golden Youth also went out of business, Hughes decided to start his own operation.[9][2][3]
Career[edit]
In February 1980, aged 24, Hughes founded Los Angeles-based Herbalife International. It has since become one of the world's largest distributors of herbal products through multi-level marketing, with sales of about $3.5 billion in 2007 and 2.1 million Independent Distributors. Now in 91 countries and achieving record retail sales of $7.5 billion in 2013 according to company statements.[10]
In the mid-1980s, Hughes was sued by the Food and Drug Administration, the California attorney general's office, and the state Department of Health, over what they said were false health claims about Herbalife products and the various schemes used to market them.[11] Health agencies accused the company of violating labeling standards and using improper sales practices.[7]
Regulators contended that the company was making medicinal claims. Medicines are regulated by the F.D.A., while nutritional supplements are not. Some health experts doubted the efficacy of Herbalife products, saying that in some instances they relied too heavily on laxatives and caffeine.[7]
In March 1985, the California attorney general and the state Department of Health Services charged him and Herbalife with making "untrue or misleading" product claims—primarily involving the caffeine content of some Herbalife products—and operating an "endless chain marketing scheme."[7]
Prompted by complaints alleging that Herbalife product users had suffered illness and death, a U.S. Senate subcommittee called Hughes before a hearing in May. Referring to a panel of nutrition experts who had criticized Herbalife in testimony the previous day, he asked the senators, "If they're such experts in weight loss, why were they so fat?"[7]
During the hearing, Hughes acknowledged that his own formal education stopped at the 9th grade. When asked during the hearing how he could be qualified to challenge leading medical experts, Hughes responded: "I defy anybody to be able to produce results as this company has."[12]
Hughes reached settlements with the regulatory agencies in 1986. To settle his problems with the state, Hughes agreed to pay $850,000. At the time, the California attorney general, John Van De Kamp, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying it was the largest settlement ever attained from a health products company.[8]
In December 1991, Hughes' and his third wife, Suzan Hughes, had a son, Alexander Reynolds "Alex" Hughes.[13]
Death[edit]
On the night of Saturday, May 20, 2000, Hughes celebrated the 87th birthday of his maternal grandmother, Hazel (known as Mimi). It was a private gathering, with a few family members joining him at his mansion in Malibu for the evening. Out of the public limelight, Hughes drank white wine, smoked a cigar and played his drum set.
Hughes was trying to buy up all outstanding shares of Herbalife and take the company private once more. The stress and long hours had taken a toll on his health; he was recovering from a recurrence of pneumonia. The treatment involved corticosteroids, which made sleeping difficult. His physician prescribed the drug doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, for the insomnia and according to security guards at 1800 Century Park East he was found dead in his office with a pile of cocaine in front of him.
On May 21, 2000, authorities said that Mark Hughes died of an accidental overdose after mixing alcohol with a "toxic level" of antidepressants. Scott Carrier, of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, said final autopsy results found that Hughes, 44, had ingested a toxic combination of alcohol and Doxepin, an antidepressant he was taking to help him sleep.[8] His blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.21.[14]
Hughes' then 9-year-old son, Alexander "Alex" Hughes, was named sole beneficiary of his father's estate, estimated to be worth $400 million. Hughes's will stipulated that, until Alex turns 35, the bulk of his inheritance would be held in a trust managed by Hughes' father, Jack Reynolds, attorney Conrad Klein, and Herbalife executive Christopher Pair.[15][16] In 2006, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled to remove Reynolds from supervising a $35 million custodianship after finding that he violated multiple probate laws by ceding control to Klein and commingling Alex's personal assets with partnership accounts.[17] Reynolds was suspended,[17] but remained one of three trustees until 2013, when a judge in a separate lawsuit ordered the removal of all three for breaching the terms of the Trust by mismanaging the funds.[18]

Mark Hughes, Founder of Herbalife, Dies at 44 - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→Police InvestigationsMark Hughes, Founder of Herbalife, Dies at 44Investigation: Body is discovered by relatives at his $25-million Malibu mansion. Foul play is not suspected.May 22, 2000|DOUGLAS P. SHUIT | TIMES STAFF WRITER


Mark Reynolds Hughes, the wealthy 44-year-old founder of Herbalife International Inc., was found dead in his Malibu beachfront mansion Sunday morning, apparently of natural causes, a sheriff's spokesman said.Hughes, enmeshed recently in a struggle for ownership of his weight-loss and nutritional products company, was reported to have died at 11:02 a.m. at his $25-million Malibu estate at 33064 Pacific Coast Highway.A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide detective was dispatched to the home, but initial reports were that there was no sign of foul play."The exact cause of his death is going to be determined by a coroner's autopsy later this week," said Deputy Bruce Thomas. "They are not leaning toward foul play at all."Hughes' relatives discovered his body, and they notified authorities, Thomas said.Upset by the valuation given his company on the stock market, Hughes unsuccessfully tried to arrange financing to buy out shareholders. The $510-million buyout, announced last September, collapsed in April.Over the years, Hughes was in and out of the public eye, as much for legal and regulatory problems that plagued his company as for his taste for expensive mansions in Beverly Hills and Malibu.In the mid-1980s, Hughes, who was 24 when he started his company, was sued by the Food and Drug Administration, the California attorney general's office, and the state Department of Health, over what they said were false health claims about Herbalife products and the various schemes used to market them.Hughes in 1985 defended his controversial diet powders and pills during a hearing before a panel of U.S. senators. Attacking three nutrition and weight-control authorities who questioned the safety of his products, Hughes asked senators:"If they're such experts, then why are they fat? I've lost 16 pounds in the last few years."During the hearing, Hughes acknowledged that his own formal education stopped at the 9th grade. When asked during the hearing how he could be qualified to challenge leading medical experts, Hughes snapped: "I defy anybody to be able to produce results as this company has."Hughes reached settlements with the regulatory agencies in 1986. To settle his problems with the state, Hughes agreed to pay $850,000.Hughes founded Herbalife in 1980, and the company hit $500 million in annual sales five years later. Revenues were generated both by outside sales and through the company's network of 750,000 independent distributors, who bought Herbalife products in a multilevel pyramid, then resold them to individual consumers. In 1986, Hughes took the company public.Last fall, dissatisfied with the price Herbalife shares were fetching on the stock market, Hughes announced he would by all the company's outstanding shares, then selling for $12 or lower, for $17 a share. The offer was increased to $17.81 in January after shareholders sued.After Hughes announced that he could not arrange the necessary financing, the company's shares dropped to below $4. At the close of trading Friday, the shares were selling for just under $10.Hughes also attracted attention with his lavish lifestyle and fondness for multimillion-dollar homes.Last year, while he was seeking financing to buy his company's outstanding shares, Hughes was battling homeowners in Benedict Canyon over his plans to build a 45,000-square-foot Mediterranean villa.The Los Angeles City Council approved construction of the proposed $50-million home, which would have been bigger than the White House. Hughes, seeking a height limit exemption, found himself in a bitter fight with local homeowners, who said they feared the exemption would pave the way for other exemptions.In December, Hughes was reported to have paid about $25 million for his Malibu home. It was said to be the highest price ever paid for a private home in Malibu.Before that, Hughes lived in a Beverly Hills mansion known as Grayhall, which he purchased in 1992 in a real estate trade valued at $20 million.

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→Herbalife International IncCOVER STORY Death and Denial at HerbalifeThe Untold Story of Mark Hughes' public image, Secret Vice and Tragic DestinyFebruary 18, 2001|MATTHEW HELLER | Matthew Heller's last story for the magazine was a profile of St. John Knits' Kelly Gray


There's a star on the stage of the Great Western Forum. Immaculately dressed as always, 6-foot-1, tanned, not a hair out of place, he is a veteran of such very public appearances. In seminar after seminar, convention after convention, he has captivated thousands of people around the world with his charisma, sincerity and enthusiasm.But this appearance, on Feb. 19, 2000, is something special for Mark Reynolds Hughes. It's part of a five-day celebration of the 20th anniversary of Herbalife International, the company he started in a former Beverly Hills wig factory. There is a lot to celebrate. At 44, Hughes is the ruler of a $956-million business empire that sells weight-management and personal-care products through a network of more than 1 million distributors in 50 countries.So-called multilevel or network marketers are lucky to stay in business for several years. Hughes has racked up 20--and become extremely rich in the process. In the preceding fiscal year, he earned more than $2 million in salary and bonuses; he controls 60% of Herbalife stock, worth about $250 million, and has interests in suppliers of the company's products. In 1998, he collected a tidy $43 million in a leveraged buyout of one manufacturer. He owns homes in Beverly Hills, Malibu and Maui, and is planning to build a veritable San Simeon on a mountaintop above Benedict Canyon.From the Forum stage, Hughes looks out on an audience of acolytes, about 4,000 Herbalife distributors who have followed his prescription for health and wealth with almost messianic fervor. To them, he is the manifestation of how a flair for salesmanship, hard work and a belief in your product can make just about anyone a millionaire. Like his followers, he sports one of the ubiquitous "Lose Weight Now, Ask Me How" badges--the slogan that also adorns telephone poles and car bumpers everywhere. "The dream he had has helped so many people like me," says Paco Perez, a distributor who was a hotel bellboy when he first met Hughes.The faithful focus their attention as the Forum Diamondvision displays a video montage of highlights from Hughes' past, from the early days of selling a protein powder out of his car trunk to his current status as chairman and chief executive of a multinational corporation headquartered in a Century City high-rise.There, on screen, is Hughes crying at Herbalife's fourth anniversary rally--"I can't believe what's happened with all of this,"he sobs--hobnobbing with the likes of Milton Berle and Merv Griffin, handing out $1-million bonus checks to distributors, globe-trotting in the company's private jet, promising to "take Herbalife around the entire world."On the Forum stage, moved by the nostalgia, Hughes again allows a tear or two to roll onto his cheeks. "I will never forget that moment," recalls Perez. "It was emotional for him and me."Three months later, on May 21, Mark Hughes is lying on the four-poster bed in the master bedroom suite of his beach retreat, a Mediterranean-style mansion on 71/2 acres with 300 feet of Pacific Ocean shoreline that he recently bought for a Malibu-record $25 million.It is late in the morning after another celebration. The 87th birthday party for Hughes' beloved maternal grandmother, Hazel, known affectionately as Mimi, had been a private affair, just a few family members joining him at home for the evening. Out of the public limelight, Hughes drank white wine, smoked a cigar and played his drum set, protected by security gates, round-the-clock guards and surveillance cameras.From an adjoining part of the suite, Darcy LaPier Hughes--his fourth wife and, like her three predecessors, a former beauty queen--enters the master bedroom. Her husband's back is facing her. He is wearing only a black T-shirt and black bikini briefs. Something about him doesn't look right. Darcy calls the guards, who realize something is very wrong. They carry him to the floor and lay him on his back to perform CPR. Unsuccessfully.The Los Angeles County coroner's office concludes he died of a toxic combination of alcohol and Doxepin, an antidepressant he was taking to help him sleep. His blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.21, more than 2 1/2 times the legal limit for driving.The death was ruled an accident, an eerie echo of the ruling on the drug-related death of Hughes' mother 25 years earlier. Hundreds of mourners grieved the loss of a man struck down in his prime who had helped so many get so rich.But the real story is even sadder, the tale of a troubled man who grew up amid discord and drug abuse and, as an adult, turned a mythical video version of his past--the Herbalife story--into his reality. It's also the story of how Mark Hughes, the super-salesman, may have become a prisoner of his public image.*1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |  Next

Mark R. Hughes, 44; Founded Nutrition Supplement Concern

Mark Reynolds Hughes, the multimillionaire founder of Herbalife International, a nutritional supplement company that has been controversial for both its products and sales methods, died last weekend in his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 44.His death appeared to be from natural causes, a spokesman for Herbalife said. An autopsy is to be completed later this week.Mr. Hughes's body was found by relatives in the bedroom of his beach-front house on the Pacific Coast Highway about 11 a.m. on Sunday. He is believed to have died late on Saturday or early Sunday.Mr. Hughes was born in Los Angeles and had only a ninth-grade education. According to the Herbalife Web site, he became interested in nutrition at 18, when his mother, JoAnn Hughes, died from an accidental overdose of prescription diet pills.

In 1976 he began selling Slender Now, a weight-loss product made by Seyforth Laboratories. The company sold its product using direct sales, in which an independent sales representative buys the product at a discount then sells it to the public. Each distributor gets a royalty from the sales of every additional distributor he brings in. It is a method Mr. Hughes would use to market and distribute Herbalife.

After three years, Seyforth failed, and Mr. Hughes, one of its top sales representatives, began selling exercise equipment and weight-loss products for another company before teaming with Richard Marconi, a former colleague at Slender Now, to start Herbalife in 1980.Mr. Hughes started selling Herbalife -- based on ''natural and herbal ingredients'' -- from his car. In five years he was a millionaire.In 1985, he paid $7 million for a house owned by the country singer and actor Kenny Rogers.His infomercials, featuring revival-style testimonials from people who had used Herbalife products, were shown on cable TV, and he promoted his products on those same programs with a fierce, evangelical fervor.

In 1986, he took Herbalife public.Members of his sales force, at the time estimated to be more than 700,000 in the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain, were known to wear badges saying ''Lose weight now/Ask me how!''But in the wake of the success came controversy. Federal and California health agencies accused the company of violating labeling standards and using improper sales practices. According to The Associated Press, regulators contended that the company was making medicinal claims. Medicines are regulated by the F.D.A., while nutritional supplements are not.Some health experts doubted the efficacy of Herbalife products, saying that in some instances they relied too heavily on laxatives and caffeine.In 1986, Herbalife, while admitting no wrongdoing, settled with California by paying $850,000 in fines and agreeing to take some products off the market. At the time, the California attorney general, John Van De Kamp, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying it was the ''largest settlement ever attained from a health products company.''In February 1999, Mr. Hughes announced plans to buy the outstanding stock of his company but abandoned those plans last month because of trouble obtaining financing.The company reported 1999 retail  sales of $1.79 billion, in 46 countries, and a worldwide sales force of more than a million people.

Mr. Hughes is survived by his third wife, the former Darcy LaPier; his father, Jack Reynolds; his grandmother, Hazel Hughes; three half-brothers, Kirk Hartmen, Jon Hughes and Don Hughes; and a son, Alexander Hughes. Continue reading the main story
