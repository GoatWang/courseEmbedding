QUESTIONs you should ask... answers you should EXPECT...





                                    What services are provided?
                                    





Many firms call their services wealth management but really only provide investment management with some window dressing. 
                That may be what you seek. But if what you require is wealth management defined as integrated financial planning, of which investment planning is just one important component, 
                you will want to dive deeper. Wealth management should also include retirement, estate, income tax, corporate executive, 
                business succession, and insurance/risk management planning. If these are services you require, be sure your advisor has the professional skills and experience to provide them.







                                    How are those services administered?
                                    





Ask to see sample output such as sample investment update reports and cash flow pro forma 
                hat are critical to making investment, retirement, estate, and tax planning decisions. Ask about the 
                frequency of reporting and contact. Additionally, ask who will be on your service team, so you are 
                assured that you can always speak to professional staff members who are intimately familiar with your 
                affairs.







                                    Will the Investment Planning and Reporting consider assets not held (custodied) or directly managed by the firm? 
                                    





Do they consider and report on investment assets, which are held or managed by other firms 
                – for instance in your retirement plan? In order to properly allocate a client’s portfolio for optimum 
                outcomes, all assets must be considered as a whole.

LEADERSHIP
 














Global Capital Advisors™, LLC was founded in February, 2008  by Mark K. Nichols, a 30-year veteran of Bank of America. With over 13 years of experience  as a Managing Director in the Private Placement Group of Banc of America  Securities, LLC, Nichols helped build the largest private placement franchise  in the market.
Working in a firm that ranked continuously #1 in traditional private  placements for more than a decade, Nichols gained broad experience in the  execution and distribution of corporate, sovereign and structured names; both  high grade and high yield; including  extensive experience in arranging  cross-border corporate transactions out of Europe, India, Latin America and  Australia.







Actively involved in the execution/distribution of these transactions, Nichols became thoroughly familiar with the alternate structures and documentation protocols for private placements and developed long-standing personal relationships with key portfolio managers at every major institutional Investor active in the market, including, as well, associated legal counsel representing both Issuers and Investors.

                          Since forming GCA, Nichols has led its growth in client engagements as well as product and geographic diversity. In addition to advising clients on all aspects of debt private placements, including Investor Relations, Nichols has overseen the growth of GCA's core Ratings Advisory practice, including, most recently, Transfer Pricing Advisory.

                          Nichols is a member in good standing of the National Investor Relations Institute ("NIRI") and an Advisory Board member of the Private Placements Industry Forum.


                          In March of 2009, Robert A. Weiss, Managing Director, Head of Ratings and Debt Transfer Pricing joined the firm to establish a Ratings Advisory Service. Prior to joining Global Capital Advisors, Bob was Managing Director  and Head of Banc of America Securities' Ratings Advisory Group. Bob's responsibilities included advising both new and experienced debt issuers  throughout the ratings process in a variety of contexts, including new debt  issuance in the public, private and institutional loan sectors; merger and  acquisition activity; as well as advising on the implications of shifts in  corporate financial policy on an issuer's credit profile. Prior to his time at  Bank of America, Bob spent 12 years at Standard & Poor's where he was Head  of S&P's Global Energy Ratings Group. Prior to S&P, Bob held finance  related positions at natural resource and consumer product companies. 








Bob has also spear-headed the growth of GCA's Transfer Pricing Advisory practice which meets the needs of multinational companies in need of documentary support for the amount, structure and pricing of inter-company debt. Working closely with these firms and their accounting advisors, GCA produces a Transfer Pricing Report providing both an Implied Credit Profile for the issuer of the debt as well as Indicative Pricing for issuance in the high grade or high yield capital markets. This report is designed to provide independent 3rd party support via a vis national taxing authorities with respect to the sizing and pricing of issuers' inter-company debt.
Bob has worked with both investment and non-investment grade clients across all global industry sectors including:

natural resources (energy, coal, gas pipelines, gas and electric utilities, metals and mining),
chemicals, paper & forest products, shipping, technology, consumer products, business & consumer  services, auto supply, retail, media & telecommunications, real estate, and 
project financings. 

As Managing Director within GCA, Bob is responsible for offering GCA clients Ratings Advisory and Debt Transfer Pricing Services with particular focus on:



Debt Transfer Pricing for Multinational companies requiring a defensible, credible and thoroughly documented opinion on the Implied Credit profile of their stand-alone foreign borrowing subsidiary(ies).
Companies looking to obtain a rating for the 1st time from NRSRO's or the NAIC. 
Companies looking to obtain an additional rating from a NRSRO.
Companies preparing for the annual review with their rating agencies.
Companies who have received an adverse NAIC rating and are seeking to appeal and/or obtain a 3rd party rating.
Companies who need advice with respect to the stand-alone debt capacity of subsidiaries.


                        Since Joining GCA,, Bob has become a frequent Panel Chairman on Ratings at the annual Private Placement Industry Forum where he leads discussions on latest trends in rating methodologies as well as the role of the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC in the market for private placements.
						
						




 Greg Johnson, Managing Director, joined GCA in 2013 following a 23-year career at Bank of America where he held a variety of positions within the Capital Markets group, including Head of International Debt Capital Markets.  Greg�s experience includes tens of billions of dollar equivalent transactions in multiple currencies and encompasses issuance from companies located in twenty different countries.  His transactional experience includes both public and private issues and numerous �first-of-their-kind� transactions involving structural as well as market innovation.  During his career, Greg dealt with numerous credit rating and restructuring issues, developing a deep appreciation of all aspects of debt issuance.  He believes his �real world� corporate debt experience uniquely qualifies him to assist potential issuers of private or intercompany debt.
						







Greg�s ability to accurately read market appetite is evidenced by his leadership in numerous unusual transactions, including first time debt private placement issues from the countries of Chile, Greece and Spain.  Groundbreaking structural issues included the first automobile lease securitization, the first international bank diversified payment right deal, and the first most favored lender private placement transaction.  Such market innovation was undoubtedly an important contributor to Bank of America�s undisputed ranking as the #1 Private Placement Group for 16 consecutive years.  
						Greg�s experience spans high grade to high yield corporate debt as well as highly structured financings including secured, swapped, asset backed, project finance, agency guaranteed, partnership, real estate and put transactions.  His experience spans virtually every industry.  In addition to his involvement in public debt market underwriting, Greg authorized purchase commitments for underwritten senior and subordinated private debt and negotiated multiple repurchases and restructurings of corporate obligations.  He also contributed to the development of the Model Note Agreement, provided rating agency and investor relations advice, and published in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance. 
						Prior to joining Bank of America, Greg worked as a financial consultant and as an electrical engineer.  He has his MBA from the Wharton School and his BSEE from the University of Virginia.  
						










 Rob Spee has re-joined Global Capital Advisors full-time as Managing Director Asia/Pacific Region following secondment to CIMB Bank in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he served as Co-Head of Regional & Corporate Banking.  Rob brings a wealth of experience in the Asian/Pacific markets, having served for over 25 years in a variety of corporate finance positions at a number of major Australian and international banks. One of the most respected bankers in Australia, Rob is well positioned to manage GCA's expanding portfolio of services in the Asia/Pacific Region. 
						


Prior to joining GCA in 2009, Rob was Global Head of Relationship Lending at ANZ Institutional Bank, where he led a team of 25 professionals accountable for product and portfolio management involving over A$100 billion  in risk weighted assets. As leader of this team, Rob contributed to enabling ANZ to rank # 1 in relationship banking in Australia.  While at ANZ, Robert also served as Chief Operating Officer for Corporate Finance as well as Global Head of Utilities, Transport, Healthcare, Telecoms and Infrastructure.
Prior to Westpac, Rob spent five years at Bank of America Australia Limited where he was a Managing Director in the Investment Banking Group, responsible for the Bank�s cross-border capital raising activities in Australia and New Zealand. During this period, he established Bank of America as the leading arranger of debt private placements in the Australian market, successfully originating and executing transactions for Santos, Futuris, Ticor, PMP, Downer Group, Consolidated Press Holdings, Ltd and Westrac.
Prior to Bank of America, Rob spent 7 years at Toronto Dominion Bank where he was a Director-Corporate Finance as well as a Member of the Board of Directors of Toronto Dominion Australia Limited. During his time at TD, Rob contributed to migrating the bank to a more agile and relevant industry based sales and marketing model.
Rob is amongst the most experienced corporate & investment bankers in Australia and we look forward to his substantially enhancing our efforts to grow our franchise in the Australian/Asian markets.
Rob holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Melbourne and a Master of Applied Finance from Macquarie University, Sydney.

LibraryContactsManaging capital and transactions in a changing world    16th US Capital Confidence Barometer 			Despite greater macro tumult than ever before, US executives are solidly optimistic, showing a meaningful increase in new deal activity since the start of 2017.     Using divestments to capitalize on disruption 			Unprecedented geopolitical uncertainty and technological change are making portfolio and divestment strategy more vital than ever. Read about leading practices in our Global Divestment Study.  Need to make better and more-informed decisions about how to strategically manage capital and transactions in a changing world? Let us help.	The Capital Agenda puts your capital needs at the heart of our strategy and focuses on the issues that matter most to you:               		Raising capital 		A company’s ability to raise capital quickly and effectively is integral to its growth potential and financial well-being. This is true in good times and in bad. 		Whatever the motivation for raising capital, companies can access new funds more effectively if they have planned ahead. They should know how and where they could access capital, if they need it. 		The focus should be:  			Fundraising (equity and debt): IPO readiness, right issues, PE, private placement and capital markets 			Optimizing funding structures 			Asset divestment 			Infrastructure projects 			Cost- and tax-efficient structures   See how we can help. × 		Investing capital 		Investors in your organization want to know why: why this transaction, why at this price and why now? 		Complicating matters, differing stakeholders increasingly bring differing expectations of investments and returns. 		The focus should be:  			Acquisition and alliances 			Delivery of synergies and effective integration 			Planning and structuring transactions to optimize stakeholder return 			Focused due diligence to mitigate risk and drive value 			Asset valuations 			Cost- and tax-efficient structures   See how we can help. × 		Preserving capital 		Every business needs to continuously assess the potential impact of evolving market conditions on the performance of its operations and its capital base. Even in a recovering market, companies believing themselves in a stable position can find their situation can change. 		The preservation of capital requires that companies continuously scour their strategies, markets and balance sheets to reassess strengths and weaknesses. 		The focus should be:  			Stress and distress — e.g., liquidity issues and turnaround plan 			Customer and supplier analysis 			Preserving tax assets and minimizing costs 			Refinancing and restructuring debt, equity and other obligations 			Dealing with stakeholder relationships and pressure 			Dispute resolution   See how we can help. × 		Optimizing capital 		Today’s economic climate is forcing businesses to candidly assess their financial fitness. 		More than a mere review of operations, companies today must conduct objective assessments of the alignment of their business strategies. 		The focus should be:  			Optimizing asset portfolio 			Delivery of synergies and effective integration 			Improving working capital and releasing cash 			Optimizing capital structure 			Optimizing tax and corporate structure   See how we can help. ×	 Related contentTransformation through M&A: US outlook Companies will use M&A to alter their DNA in 2017 as they remain focused on deals, joint ventures and alliances for fast and strategic solutions, notes EY.2017 Global Private Equity Survey PE firms have had to dedicate significant resources to non-investment-related tasks.
