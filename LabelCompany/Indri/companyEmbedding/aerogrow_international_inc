About AeroGrow International, Inc.









About AeroGrow International, Inc
The Story of AeroGrow
Growing fresh food and flowers lifts the  spirit and nurtures the soul. But for most people, the nurturing ends  when winter begins. AeroGrow founder Michael Bissonnette said, "Wouldn't  it be great to have fresh herbs, flowers and veggies growing in your  home, any time of year?". So he and a group of like-minded innovators  married that notion to aeroponics, a highly efficient gardening  technology in which plants grow in water, nutrients and air.

After four years, dozens of prototypes, and  hundreds of seed evaluations, the AeroGarden was born and today there  are  over 500,000 enthusiastic AeroGarden customers. Michael is awed by  the response. "It's amazing", he says. "We grew some basil, and started a  revolution."

You do not have to get dirty to grow plants and get high yields of your favourite vegetables, fruits, and herbs. With a hydroponic system, you can grow plants without ever having to touch soil. The system uses a water solution that is rich with nutrients to nourish your plants and allow them to grow large and healthy. With an indoor hydroponic system, you can grow your plants entirely indoors without having to worry about making a mess. The special hydroponic light system gives your plants the sunlight they need to keep growing all year round. A hydroponics setup virtually eliminates disease and parasites that may affect your plants, as these are often transmitted through the soil. Spend less time caring for sick plants and removing weeds from your garden bed, and spend more time harvesting your greens and luscious plants. Get started by shopping from reliable sellers on eBay, and find a hydroponic system to get higher yields from your garden without ever having to get dirty.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryHydroponics & Seed Starting SuppliesComplete Hydroponic SystemsHydroponic Environmental ControlsGrow Light BallastsGrow Light BulbsGrow Light KitsGrow Light Parts & AccessoriesHydroponic Growing MediaHydroponic Parts & AccessoriesHydroponic Nutrients, pH & SupplementsHydroponic Seed Starting & Cloning SuppliesHydroponic Tents, Tarps & ShelvesOther Hydroponics & Seed Starting SuppliesTypesee allAquaponicsGrow CabinetAeroponicsDrip IrrigationEbb & FlowDeep Water CultureBrandsee allAeroGardenHydrofarmUnbrandedConditionsee allNewNew other (see details)UsedFor parts or not workingNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
