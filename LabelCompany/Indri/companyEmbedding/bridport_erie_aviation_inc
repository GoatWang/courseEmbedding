About Erie Aviation, Inc. 


Erie Aviation’s roots go back to the 1960’s when the FBO at the Erie Airport started an avionics repair facility. By 1985, this had evolved to working on batteries for commercial airliners and, in 1987, we signed our first representation agreement with a European supplier to BAe and to a fast-growing company in Europe called Airbus. 

In the years since, Erie Aviation has become an integral part of the world-wide customer support network for around 15 Airbus suppliers, and we look after airlines in all of the Americas. These companies have in turn grown and our product base now includes aircraft from Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer, Fairchild-Dornier, Saab, Fokker and, of course, also Airbus and BAe. 

We are located on the grounds of Erie International Airport - Tom Ridge Field.
