BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. (4C Medical), a medical technology company focused on the development of minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, today announced it has completed a private placement of unsecured convertible promissory notes resulting in gross proceeds to the company of approximately $9 million. 4C Medical intends to use the proceeds from the financing to fund the continued development of its transcatheter technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR). The financing was led by an investment of $3.5 million by Anges Québec, the largest angel network in Canada. 








"We are pleased there has been such strong interest in our company and technology. Currently we are two quarters ahead of our 2017 milestones and goals. Due to this early success we decided to accelerate key 2018 milestones. To fund this acceleration, we announced in May of this year our intention to increase our convertible note offering goal from $4 million to $8 million," said Robert Thatcher, CEO of 4C Medical. "The proceeds from this financing will be used to finalize the design of our technology, which will be used in our planned early feasibility study in the United States, and possibly Japan, to achieve first-in-human implants."
4C Medical is developing the first transcatheter MR therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using a supra-annular, atrial-only fixation technology. This novel technology is designed to eliminate the known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) technologies, which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and/or the left ventricle. 
"We are excited to invest in 4C Medical," said Stéphane Pilette, Vice President of Investment Support at Anges Québec. "With a proven leadership team and a truly novel TMVR technology that eliminates the issues seen with current TMVR technologies, 4C Medical has the potential to addresses a significant unmet need." 
"The native mitral annulus is asymmetrical and the geometry of the valve leaflets is irregular, causing major challenges for TMVR technologies in development today, which depend on the unpredictable anatomy for sizing and anchoring," said Jeffrey Chambers, MD, Founder and Chief Medical Officer of 4C Medical. "Millions of patients suffer from MR and many are undertreated. Our mission is to develop a treatment option that overcomes these challenges. With the support of our investors, our team is dedicated to achieve this goal."
MR is a common heart valve disease affecting nearly 10 percent of Americans aged 75 years and older.1 MR occurs when the mitral valve leaflets do not close properly and allow blood in the left ventricle to leak back into the left atrium. It is a progressive disease and if left untreated, MR can lead to atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and death.
About 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. 4C Medical is a medical device company developing minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, focusing initially on mitral regurgitation (MR) therapy and subsequently on tricuspid regurgitation therapy. The company's implant is the first MR therapy with supra-annular positioning and atrial-only fixation.

          Presentation Featured the Company's Supra-Annular Implant, the First Transcatheter Mitral Regurgitation Therapy with Atrial-Only Fixation

BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 4C Medical Technologies, Inc., a developer of minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, today announced that its medical device therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR) was featured in the Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Innovation Forum which took place June 14, 2017 in Chicago, IL. The company is developing the first MR therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using a supra-annular, atrial-only fixation technology. The novel design eliminates known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle. 








"4C Medical's mitral valve is an innovative and simple solution for a very common problem, and its unique mechanism will allow treatment of many patients not suitable for current TMVR devices," said Philippe Généreux, MD. "30-day pre-clinical results are promising and demonstrate concept feasibility and safety, with no hemodynamic compromise, no thrombus, and mild-to-no MR as confirmed by echocardiography."
Dr. Généreux presented "4C Medical Valve: A Novel Transcatheter MR Treatment Technology" and facilitated subsequent roundtable discussions with audience Q&A. He is Co-Director of the Structural Heart Program at the Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute of Morristown Medical Center (Morristown, NJ) and a practicing Interventional Cardiologist at Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal (Montreal, Canada).
"The main challenges encountered by current TMVR devices are related to the complexity of the mitral valve anatomy and the multitude of MR mechanisms," said Dr. Généreux. "With its supra-annular position in the left atrium, the 4C Medical device preserves the native valve apparatus and avoids all issues related to the complexity and dynamism of the mitral annulus, making the device suitable for patients independent of their MR mechanism. This unique approach promotes healthy left ventricular remodeling and healing, and eliminates the complications that are associated with current TMVR devices, such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, device embolization and early device fatigue failure."
"We are dedicated to innovating therapies for structural heart disease through clinical research in partnership with Key Opinion Leaders," said Robert Thatcher, CEO of 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. "More than half of symptomatic MR patients are not candidates for surgery, and we are driven to develop new solutions that clinicians can use to improve the quality of life for these patients."

Über Mitralklappeninsuffizienz
Mitralklappeninsuffizienz (MR) ist eine häufig vorkommende Erkrankung der Herzklappen, welche nahezu 10 % aller Amerikaner der Altersgruppe ≥ 75 betrifft.1 MR liegt vor, wenn die Mitralklappen sich nicht richtig schließen und Blut des linken Ventrikels zurück in den linken Vorhof fließt. Es handelt sich um eine progressive Erkrankung und wenn keine Behandlung erfolgt, kann MR zu Herzflimmern, pulmonaler Hypertension, Herzversagen und zum Tode führen.
Über 4C Medical Technologies Inc.
4C Medical Technologies Inc. ist ein Hersteller von Medizingeräten, der minimal-invasive Therapien für strukturelle Herzerkrankungen entwickelt. Der erste Schwerpunkt lag auf Therapie der Mitralklappeninsuffizienz (MR) und nachfolgend auf Therapie trikuspidaler Insuffizienz. Das einzigartige supra-annulare Implantat des Unternehmens stellt die erste MR-Therapie mit rein atrialer Fixierung dar. Damit werden bekannte Probleme bei Transkatheter-MR-Ersatz eliminiert, welche Platzierung und Fixierung im nativen mitralen Annulus und linken Ventrikel nutzt.

Cette présentation a porté sur l'implant supra-annulaire de la société, le premier traitement de l'insuffisance mitrale par cathétérisme avec une fixation qui ne concerne que l'oreillette
BROOKLYN PARK, Minnesota, 19 juin 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 4C Medical Technologies, Inc., une entreprise qui met au point des thérapies minimalement invasive pour les troubles cardiaques structurels, a annoncé aujourd'hui que son dispositif pour le traitement de l'insuffisance mitrale (MR) avait été présenté au Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Innovation Forum, qui s'est déroulé le 14 juin 2017 à Chicago, Illinois. Cette société met au point la première thérapie MR à préserver la valve mitrale et le ventricule gauche natifs en faisant appel à une technologie de fixation supra-annulaire qui ne concerne que l'oreillette. Cette conception inédite permet d'éliminer les problèmes connus liés aux technologies de remplacement IM par cathétérisme (TMVR) qui reposent sur une pose et une fixation dans l'anneau mitral et le ventricule gauche natifs. 








« La valve mitrale de 4C Medical est une solution innovante et simple pour une affection très courante, et son mécanisme inédit permettra de traiter de nombreux patients pour lesquels les dispositifs TMVR actuels ne sont pas adaptés », explique le docteur Philippe Généreux, MD. « Les résultats précliniques sur 30 jours sont prometteurs et démontrent la faisabilité et l'innocuité du concept, sans compromis hémodynamique, sans thrombus et avec une MR de moyenne à nulle, comme l'a confirmé l'échocardiographie ».
Le Dr Généreux a présenté « 4C Medical Valve: A Novel Transcatheter MR Treatment Technology » et animé ensuite une table ronde avec une séance de questions-réponses avec le public. Il est co-directeur du programme pour les maladies cardiaques structurelles au Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute of Morristown Medical Center (Morristown, New Jersey) et cardiologue interventionniste à l'Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal (Montréal, Canada).
« Les principales difficultés rencontrées avec les dispositifs TMVR actuels sont liées à la complexité de l'anatomie de la valve mitrale et à la multitude des mécanismes MR », selon le Dr Généreux. « Avec sa position supra-annulaire dans l'oreillette gauche, le dispositif 4C Medical préserve le mécanisme de valve natif et permet d'éviter tous les problèmes liés à la complexité et au dynamisme de l'anneau mitral, ce qui lui permet d'être utilisé chez les patients indépendamment de leur mécanisme MR. Cette approche inédite permet un remodelage et une guérison saine du ventricule gauche, et élimine les complications liées aux dispositifs TMVR actuels, comme l'obstruction du débit du ventricule gauche, l'embolisation du dispositif et une rupture précoce par fatigue ».
« Nous sommes attachés à des thérapies innovantes pour les maladies cardiaques structurelles grâce à la recherche clinique en partenariat avec les principaux leaders d'opinion », ajoute Robert Thatcher, PDG de 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. « Plus de la moitié des patients MR symptomatiques ne doivent pas subir d'opération, et nous nous attelons donc à élaborer de nouvelles solutions auxquelles les médecins hospitaliers peuvent faire appel pour améliorer la qualité de vie de ces patients ».
A propos de l'insuffisance mitrale L'insuffisance mitrale (MR) est une affectation courante de la valve cardiaque qui touche près de 10 pour cent des Américains âgés ≥75 ans1. Elle survient lorsque les feuillets de la valve mitrale ne se ferment pas correctement et laissent du sang du ventricule gauche s'écouler dans l'oreillette gauche. Il s'agit d'une maladie évolutive qui, si elle n'est pas traitée, peut provoquer une fibrillation auriculaire, une hypertension pulmonaire, une insuffisance cardiaque et même la mort.
A propos de 4C Medical Technologies, Inc.4C Medical Technologies, Inc. est un fabricant de dispositifs médicaux qui met au point des thérapies minimalement invasives pour les maladies structurelles du cœur, et qui s'est d'abord intéressée au traitement de l'insuffisance mitrale (IM) pour s'intéresser ensuite au traitement de la régurgitation tricuspidienne. L'implant supra-annulaire inédit qu'elle propose est la première thérapie IM à faire appel à une fixation qui ne concerne que l'oreillette, et il permet d'éviter les problèmes connus d'autres technologies de remplacement IM par cathétérisme qui font appel à une pose et une fixation dans l'anneau mitral natif et le ventricule gauche.

BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 4C Medical Technologies, Inc., a developer of minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, today announced that its medical device therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR) was featured in the Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Innovation Forum which took place June 14, 2017 in Chicago, IL. The company is developing the first MR therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using a supra-annular, atrial-only fixation technology. The novel design eliminates known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle. "4C Medical's mitral valve is an innovative and simple solution for a very common problem, and its unique mechanism will allow treatment of many patients not suitable for current TMVR devices," said Philippe Généreux, MD. "30-day pre-clinical results are promising and demonstrate concept feasibility and safety, with no hemodynamic compromise, no thrombus, and mild-to-no MR as confirmed by echocardiography."Dr. Généreux presented "4C Medical Valve: A Novel Transcatheter MR Treatment Technology" and facilitated subsequent roundtable discussions with audience Q&A. He is Co-Director of the Structural Heart Program at the Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute of Morristown Medical Center (Morristown, NJ) and a practicing Interventional Cardiologist at Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal (Montreal, Canada)."The main challenges encountered by current TMVR devices are related to the complexity of the mitral valve anatomy and the multitude of MR mechanisms," said Dr. Généreux. "With its supra-annular position in the left atrium, the 4C Medical device preserves the native valve apparatus and avoids all issues related to the complexity and dynamism of the mitral annulus, making the device suitable for patients independent of their MR mechanism. This unique approach promotes healthy left ventricular remodeling and healing, and eliminates the complications that are associated with current TMVR devices, such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, device embolization and early device fatigue failure.""We are dedicated to innovating therapies for structural heart disease through clinical research in partnership with Key Opinion Leaders," said Robert Thatcher, CEO of 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. "More than half of symptomatic MR patients are not candidates for surgery, and we are driven to develop new solutions that clinicians can use to improve the quality of life for these patients."About Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease affecting nearly 10 percent of Americans aged 75 years.1 MR occurs when the mitral valve leaflets do not close properly and allow blood in the left ventricle to leak back into the left atrium. It is a progressive disease and if left untreated, MR can lead to atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and death.About 4C Medical Technologies, Inc.4C Medical Technologies, Inc. is a medical device company developing minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, focusing initially on mitral regurgitation (MR) therapy and subsequently on tricuspid regurgitation therapy. The company's unique supra-annular implant is the first MR therapy with atrial-only fixation, thereby eliminating known issues associated with transcatheter MR replacement technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle. 1.Nkomo VT, et al.

BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., June 8, 2017

          BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 4C Medical Technologies, Inc., a developer of minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, today announced that its medical device therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR) will be featured in the Innovation Forum at the Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) conference June 14-17, 2017 in Chicago, IL. The company is developing the first novel MR therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using supra-annular, atrial-only fixation technology. The design eliminates known issues of other transcatheter MR replacement technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle.


The TVT Innovation Forum, which takes place opening night, is the preeminent session featuring new technological developments in the field of transcatheter valve therapy. Martin B. Leon, MD and Gregg W. Stone, MD, two of TVT's course directors, will moderate the 1-hour session which begins at 7:00 pm on Wednesday, June 14 in the Sheraton Chicago Ballroom IV-VII.
Philippe Généreux, MD will present "4C Medical Valve: A Novel Transcatheter MR Treatment Technology" at 7:48 pm and facilitate the subsequent roundtable discussion with audience Q&A. Dr. Généreux is Co-Director of the Structural Heart Program at the Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute of Morristown Medical Center (Morristown, NJ) and a practicing Interventional Cardiologist at Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal (Montreal, Canada).
"We are honored to be one of the five concepts recognized for its unique innovation," said Robert Thatcher, CEO of 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. "Our team has made significant progress over the past year to develop and evaluate the first-of-its-kind supra-annular implant design, and this presentation is the ideal forum to introduce our novel MR therapy to the clinical community." 

About Mitral Regurgitation

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease affecting nearly 10 percent of Americans aged ≥75 years.1 MR occurs when the mitral valve leaflets do not close properly and allow blood in the left ventricle to leak back into the left atrium. It is a progressive disease and if left untreated, MR can lead to atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and death.

About 4C Medical Technologies, Inc.

The company's unique supra-annular implant is the first MR therapy with atrial-only fixation, thereby eliminating known issues associated with transcatheter MR replacement technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle.

4C Medical raised US $9.1M led by Anges Québec

United States 





4C Medical Technologies, Inc., a Brooklyn Park, Minnesota based medical technology developer of minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, has raised  US $9.1 million by way of a private placement of unsecured convertible promissory notes.
Montreal based angel group, Anges Québec, led the financing with US $3.5 million investment.
4C Medical intends to use the proceeds from the financing to fund the continued development of its transcatheter technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR).
4C Medical is developing the first transcatheter MR therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using a supra-annular, atrial-only fixation technology. This novel technology is designed to eliminate the known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) technologies, which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and/or the left ventricle.
“We’re delighted with the interest in our company and our technology, and we appreciate the leadership demonstrated by Anges Québec in this investment round,” said Robert Thatcher, president and CEO of 4C Medical. “We’re already ahead of schedule on our 2017 targets by two quarters. Given how well things are going, we’ve decided to get a jump on our 2018 targets. To finance our effort, we announced last May that we planned to increase financing using convertible debt until we reached our US$8million goal.  With the support of Anges Québec we exceeded our goal. Proceeds from this round will go toward finalizing the technology to be used in our early human feasibility study in the U.S, and perhaps Japan.”
“The asymmetry of the native mitral annulus and the irregular shape of the valve leaflets considerably complicate the development of these technologies, whose size and fixation mechanisms are tributary to unpredictable anatomical characteristics,” explained Dr. Jeffrey Chambers, MD, founder and chief medical officer of 4C Medical. Millions of patients have MR, and many don’t get proper treatment. Our mission is to develop a treatment that overcomes the problems associated with existing technologies. With the support of our investors, our team is entirely dedicated to this goal”
Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve condition affecting nearly 10% of Americans age 75 and over.1 It occurs when mitral valve leaflets don’t close properly, and allow blood in the left ventricle to leak back into the left atrium. It is a progressive illness, and if left untreated, can lead to atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and even death.
“We’re very happy to add 4C Medical to our extensive portfolio of medical technology companies,” said Stéphane Pilette, Vice President, Investment Support at Anges Québec. “With its seasoned management team and its revolutionary transcatheter mitral valve replacement technology, 4C Medical has everything it takes to solve a serious heart valve condition for which few options are currently available.”

4C Medical's Novel Mitral Regurgitation Therapy Highlighted at TVT Innovation Forum

Presentation Featured the Company's Supra-Annular Implant, the First Transcatheter Mitral Regurgitation Therapy with Atrial-Only Fixation




Jun 15, 2017, 7:04am EDT














BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 4C Medical Technologies, Inc., a developer of minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, today announced that its medical device therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR) was featured in the Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Innovation Forum which took place June 14, 2017 in Chicago, IL. The company is developing the first MR therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using a supra-annular, atrial-only fixation technology. The novel design eliminates known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle. 



"4C Medical's mitral valve is an innovative and simple solution for a very common problem, and its unique mechanism will allow treatment of many patients not suitable for current TMVR devices," said Philippe Généreux, MD. "30-day pre-clinical results are promising and demonstrate concept feasibility and safety, with no hemodynamic compromise, no thrombus, and mild-to-no MR as confirmed by echocardiography."
Dr. Généreux presented "4C Medical Valve: A Novel Transcatheter MR Treatment Technology" and facilitated subsequent roundtable discussions with audience Q&A. He is Co-Director of the Structural Heart Program at the Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute of Morristown Medical Center (Morristown, NJ) and a practicing Interventional Cardiologist at Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal (Montreal, Canada).
"The main challenges encountered by current TMVR devices are related to the complexity of the mitral valve anatomy and the multitude of MR mechanisms," said Dr. Généreux. "With its supra-annular position in the left atrium, the 4C Medical device preserves the native valve apparatus and avoids all issues related to the complexity and dynamism of the mitral annulus, making the device suitable for patients independent of their MR mechanism. This unique approach promotes healthy left ventricular remodeling and healing, and eliminates the complications that are associated with current TMVR devices, such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, device embolization and early device fatigue failure."
"We are dedicated to innovating therapies for structural heart disease through clinical research in partnership with Key Opinion Leaders," said Robert Thatcher, CEO of 4C Medical Technologies, Inc. "More than half of symptomatic MR patients are not candidates for surgery, and we are driven to develop new solutions that clinicians can use to improve the quality of life for these patients."
About Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease affecting nearly 10 percent of Americans aged ≥75 years.1 MR occurs when the mitral valve leaflets do not close properly and allow blood in the left ventricle to leak back into the left atrium. It is a progressive disease and if left untreated, MR can lead to atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and death.
About 4C Medical Technologies, Inc.4C Medical Technologies, Inc. is a medical device company developing minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease, focusing initially on mitral regurgitation (MR) therapy and subsequently on tricuspid regurgitation therapy. The company's unique supra-annular implant is the first MR therapy with atrial-only fixation, thereby eliminating known issues associated with transcatheter MR replacement technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle.
