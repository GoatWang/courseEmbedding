SQL Database Middleware for Enscribe Applications
Escort SQL, converts Enscribe  files to the NonStop SQL industry standard relational database 
        tables and provides highly efficient database middleware supporting 
        transparent access to the SQL tables from Enscribe programs, without requiring any 
        re-programming (i.e. no source code changes or even recompiles are necessary). Users get all the benefits of having done a hand conversion to SQL without the work, time or risk involved.



Replicate All Of Your Data Without Any Program Modification
AutoTMF provides automatic data protection for your applications using the NonStop RDF and TM/MP products from 
HP's NonStop Division. No change to your existing programs is required.  
Distributed and supported worldwide by HP.


Replicate and synchronize all your non-database files automatically!
AutoSYNC provides automatic replication, distribution and synchronization of all your non-database files. AutoSYNC helps ensure disaster recovery preparedness and provides software distribution for reduced operations management.  
Distributed and supported worldwide by HP. 



Replicate and synchronize all your SQL DDL operations  automatically!
NonStop SDR replicates the SQL/MP DDL operations that are not currently 
replicated by RDF. It works very closely with RDF to ensure that data 
replication and DDL replication operations are performed in the right sequence; 
this guarantees the backup database is logically the same as the primary 
database. Like RDF, SDR operates efficiently and invisibly, requiring no 
operator intervention.  Distributed and supported worldwide by HP.


The Partition Analyzer For HP Nonstop Systems
Escort Ranger quickly and efficiently analyzes both Enscribe files and NonStop SQL tables to determine the optimal file partitioning ranges. It also supplies information to your programs to increase application parallelization.



Escort Journaling allows databases to be loaded on-line, while the "source" data files are being accessed and updated.

Harry Scott on AutoTMF and the Sale of Three Carr Scott Products

Harry ScottCo-FounderCarr Scott Software
GG: Hi Harry, long time no see. Thanks for being a part of NonStop Innovations.HS: It's my pleasure. Thanks for the invite.

GG: I saw that Carr Scott is hosting a pre-conference workshop on NonStop AutoTMF installation, configuration and operation. For those AutoTMF users who want to attend, could you summarize the seminar?HS: The workshop is being run by Johanne Corbeil, our manager of technical support and training, and David Sly from HP UK, who is an expert in NonStop disaster recovery implementations. David and Johanne will give an overview of NonStop AutoTMF and cover some of the many features the product has. They will focus on how the product has been successfully implemented in many customer disaster recovery environments around the world. As you may know, TMF is used as a foundation for reliable database replication by HP’s RDF product and many of the other third party replication products. They will also cover how AutoTMF decides how to generate and manage its automatic transactions, and how to configure, monitor and troubleshoot their AutoTMF environment.
[See the abstract here, and go to the workshop at 8am on Sunday, November 3rd at the NonStop TBC.]

GG: Could you tell me more about AutoTMF and what it does?HS: It allows NonStop users to implement TMF without having to reprogram their applications. It isn't the only product that does this, but it is the only comprehensive product of its kind. TMF is very popular, but not all companies have the time to recode their applications to use TMF. A large percentage of NonStop customers use TMF and hundreds of them use NonStop AutoTMF to provide automatic transactions.

GG: I heard that Carr Scott Software made a big announcement today. Can we share the news with our readers?HS: Absolutely. Since we began in 1996, we have been the leader in database modernization for the NonStop platform with our Escort SQL suite of products. Recently we have seen a significant uptick in customer interest and demand around the world. To help meet that growing demand, we are pleased to announce that comForte is planning to acquire our Escort SQL, Journaling, and RANGER suite of products. Given the surge in demand we are seeing, comForte with their team of more than 70 NonStop experts around the globe are in a great position to help customers wherever they are. comForte has a large global sales force, marketing department, and support team that will be able to meet this growing demand, and they will also be able to provide support in multiple languages. We expect the deal will be complete by the end of the year.

GG: What is the function of these products?HS: Escort SQL converts Enscribe applications and files to the NonStop SQL database, Journaling provides online loading of Enscribe data to NonStop SQL databases, and Ranger quickly analyzes both Enscribe files and NonStop SQL tables to determine the optimal file partitioning ranges.

GG: Are you headed off into the sunset or is there more from Carr Scott Software?HS: While comForte will be acquiring the Escort suite of products, we will be helping them in the months and years ahead with new sales and over time, we will begin transitioning our existing Escort SQL and RANGER customers over to comForte’s capable hands. We will also continue to directly own and nurture the products we provide through HP, specifically NonStop AutoTMF, NonStop AutoSYNC and SDR.

GG: What do you have planned for the next year or so?HS: As I said, we will work closely with comForte over the next couple of years to transition support for our existing customers and we expect to be visiting their offices and customers around the world to provide greater exposure and training on these great products.

GG: It was great to see you again. Thanks again for doing the interview.HS: Great to see you, too. Enjoy the conference.
