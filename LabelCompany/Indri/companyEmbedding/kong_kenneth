Ultra Wide Angle lenses in the market tends to suffer a optical distortion rate from 2-5% which causes straight lines to bend. Our LAOWA lens features a *close-to-zero distortion rate that you can barely notice from your eye.
If you are not so sure what distortion is, this article may helps. https://photographylife.com/what-is-distortion

 * The aforementioned close-to-zero distortion rate is measured from shooting objects at infinity focus. The distortion rate may vary for shorter object distance. Only Optical Distortion (Barrel/ Pincushion/ Moustache) is covered here.



Our LAOWA 12mm f/2.8 Lens cover a ultra-wide 122° angle of view for you to create an outstanding landscape or architecture shot that no others can compare. Shooting interior shots will also become much easier. Your house will become spacious and impactful in your photo even if you are shooting a small area. Do not forget, this is also the world’s widest rectilinear f/2.8 lens.

Weigh merely 609g, our LAOWA Lens is an every-day lens. It is really small compared to other UWA lenses in the market. You finally do not need to bring a hefty piece of glass for work and travel. Also, you can now insert 2pcs of 100mm (not 150mm!!) ND filters & 1pc of 105mm CPL filter with the Laowa 100mm filter holder system to create your best landscape photo ever.
 



 



Our LAOWA 12mm f/2.8 ZERO-D is currently the ※brightest (or fastest) 12mm lens in the market. Astro photographers will truly appreciate our effort to bring the lens to f/2.8. The ultra fast aperture can effectively shorten the exposure time required and help to achieve more details of the night sky. This is proven to be the perfect tool for a nice milky way shot.  The fast aperture is also very convenient for low-light / indoor shooting. (※ As of July 22, 2016)

The 122 angle of view + Close-to-zero distortion is too good to be true for panorama shooting.

Our LAOWA 12mm f/2.8 ZERO-D adopts a floating optical design to ensure an exceptional sharpness not only at infinity focus, but also in close focusing distance. Along with 18cm minimal focusing distance and 0.2x Maximum magnification, LAOWA lens is also a fun tool for some mini wide angle macro.

Laowa Water & Dust Repelling ‘Frog Eye’ Coating (FEC)
Every LAOWA 12mm f/2.8 ZERO-D will be coated with the new Laowa ‘Frog Eye’ Coating. It gives your lens an extra layer of shield. See below video to understand its difference versus traditional coating.

KONG Solutions
KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




Chicken Pot Pie
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup cooked chicken, 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




sizing
Select the right size KONG for your dog to provide the safest, most-enjoyable experience.

KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




Chicken Pot Pie
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup cooked chicken, 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.

KONG Solutions
KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




Chicken Pot Pie
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup cooked chicken, 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




sizing
Select the right size KONG for your dog to provide the safest, most-enjoyable experience.
