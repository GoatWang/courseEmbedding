Hyde School

                    Hyde School began in the early 1960s when Founder Joseph Gauld, a highly regarded mathematics teacher, was inspired to found a unique school because he believed that the existing educational system was overly focused on student achievement rather than character. One of Gauld's brightest students, who had little curiosity and relied primarily on his innate abilities, received the highest grade in the class. Another student, the classic plugger, who could not grasp the course material but who embodied curiosity and a strong work ethic, received a low grade in the class. Distraught that neither student was best served by the traditional grading system, Gauld started the Hyde School, which operated under a different set of priorities than other schools. The school began with a focus on Five Words: Courage, Integrity, Leadership, Curiosity, and Concern, and the cardinal principle that every individual was born with a unique potential that defines a destiny. Since then, Hyde has expanded with the opening of a second boarding school in Woodstock, CT, and three public schools, Hyde-DC, Hyde-Bronx, and Hyde-New Haven, CT.

An adventure in Hyperborea for from four to six characters of 4th through 6th level











 
Until about three years ago, the peculiar town of Port Greely was renowned as a prolific exporter of crustaceans. Then the Greely lobstermen severed all ties with outside partners. Subsequent attempts at renegotiation were shunned.More recently, a small group of Fishmongers’ Guild representatives from the City-State of Khromarium has gone missing in Port Greely, and answers have been less than forthcoming. At present, the Guild seeks answers. It wants to know what became of its representatives, and it wishes to re-establish its lucrative partnership with the Port Greely lobstermen. Your party have been contracted to help resolve The Mystery at Port Greely.​Text: Jeffrey P.

Ghost Ship of the Desert Dunes™
An adventure in Hyperborea for from four to six characters of 2nd through 4th level











 

Somewhere in the depths of Diamond Desert lie the skeletal remains of Ymir’s Serpent, a legendary Viking longship. In days of yore, Sigtrygg Forkbeard led his company upriver, piercing the desert’s hostile heart. There the Vikings unearthed a lost mine brimming with green diamonds, but the River Æolus desiccated as the Serpent prepared for launch, and the ship was swallowed by the dunes. Forkbeard and his company were never seen again, but tales of a shimmering Viking ghost ship gliding over the dunes persist to this day.Text: Jeffrey P.

More than a month ago, your party found itself in Port Zangerios, where you heard of an Esquimaux thief selling a treasure map. Low on wealth but high in courage, you sought him out. The man turned out to be a fearful ex-slave who had “acquired” the map from his Ixian master. The map is incomplete but shews the Isle of the Serpent in far-off Lemuria, where rests a fabulous treasure called the Feathered Crown of Nanasa (or so thought the Ixian). Pooling your money to purchase the unfinished map, you bought passage on an Amazonian trade ship. After passing through tempests and torrential rains that shimmered with auroral light, you have come to the great city of Jhaman Ket. Now you must seek out the location of the Isle of the Serpent.​Text: Joseph D.

Beneath the Comet™
An adventure in Hyperborea for from four to six characters of 6th through 9th level​​











 

For weeks the Comet has blazed in the sky above Hyperborea, inspiring widespread superstitious dread and fear of some star-borne contagion. Under the light of this harbinger from the Black Gulf, the PCs have come to Bogrest, following a magical treasure map that reveals great wealth buried in the Lonely Heath north of the village. Finding that treasure will be no simple matter, however, for Hyperborea is a weirder and deadlier place than ever beneath the Comet. Text: Ben BallEditing: David PrataFront Cover Art: Peter MullenBack Cover Art: Johnathan Bingam (inks), Daisey Bingham (colours)Interiour Illustrations: Johnathan Bingham, Del TeigelerCartography: Ben Ball, Glynn SealProduct Type: Adventure ModuleProduct Format: 44-page, 8½ × 11-inch saddle-stitched bookProduct Price: $22.00 (print); $10.00 (PDF)Product Availability: Available in print and PDF.﻿​

Also he summoned a mythical serpent to guard the vault, a beast reputed to shed gems for tears from eyeless sockets. Tales speak of this beast as the Sightless Serpent. Now, a knave of Khromarium claims to have witnessed the legendary beast.

FLORIDA INJURY ATTORNEY BLAWG



 












 January 29, 2017
Jeffrey P. Gale, P.A. // Overcoming Florida’s Work Product Privilege to Obtain Photographs

by Jeffrey P. Gale, P.A.






 


With fault being a fundamental element in all but strict liability personal injury cases, it is often critically important for both sides of a dispute to be able to view certain photographs taken after an accident to help piece together the how and why of its occurrence. Common examples include accident-scene images showing the resting place of vehicles involved in a multi-vehicle collision or a condition alleged to have caused a fall.
Very often only one side has the photographs and sometimes the party refuses to share them with the other side, citing work product privilege as the basis.
Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(b)(4) provides that a party may discover work product upon a showing of need and an inability to obtain the substantial equivalent without undue hardship. In Wackenhut Corp. v. Crant-Heisz Enters., 451 So.2d 900 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984), a property damage case involving a dispute over where, within a complex of buildings, a fire had started, only one of the two parties had photographs of a key warehouse area. Citing work product, the party with the photographs refused to produce them. On a petition for writ of certiorari, Florida’s Second DCA ordered production of the photographs, reasoning as follows:
Since the warehouse has been replaced, the scene cannot be reproduced. [Citing Dodson v. Persell, 390 So.2d 704 (Fla. 1980).] We find that Wackenhut has demonstrated exceptional circumstances regarding the photographs and authorize their discovery.
In Florida Power Corp. v. Dunn, 850 So.2d 655 (Fla. 2d DCA 2003), Florida Power sought discovery of photographs taken at the scene of an accident. When its motion was denied by the trial court, Florida Power filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the district court. Although the district court agreed that the photographs were protected work product, it held that Florida Power was entitled to production of these photographs because it met its burden under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(b)(3) [the predecessor to 1.280(b)(4)] by demonstrating exceptional circumstances and its inability to obtain the materials by other means.
Likewise, in Kmart Corporation v Sundmacher, 997 So.2d 1158 (Fla. 3rd DCA 2008), a slip-and-fall case, Kmart’s petition for certiorari seeking reversal of the trial court’s order denying its motion to compel production of accident scene photographs was granted by the district court. The court ruled as follows:
Because Kmart has satisfied the requirements of rule 1.280(b)(3) by demonstrating that the photographs in the plaintiff’s possession are relevant and material (they allegedly depict the condition of the floor at the time the plaintiff slipped and fell); there is no other means of obtaining the discovery requested (no other photographs were taken of the scene ten years ago when the incident allegedly occurred); and the photographs are the best evidence of the condition of the floor at the time of the alleged slip and fall, the trial court departed from the essential requirements of the law in denying Kmart’s request for production. Because there is no substitute for the information Kmart seeks and no way on plenary appellate review of evaluating how the information may have affected the case, Kmart has demonstrated irreparable harm and the petition should be granted. See Criswell, 636 So.2d at 563; Ruiz v. Steiner, 599 So.2d 196 (Fla. 3d DCA 1992); Carroll, 528 So.2d at 954; Colonial Penn, 380 So.2d at 1306.
In our experience, most parties turn over such photographs without lodging the work product objection. Reasonable lawyers know the law and understand the importance of certain photographs to the case. Unfortunately, some lawyers prefer to engage in obstructionist tactics in the slim hope of denying justice. More likely, it’s an opportunity to bill the client.
We are currently involved in a catastrophic injury case against such a lawyer. He has refused to turn over the only post-accident damage photographs of his client’s vehicle, which were taken at the scene by his client using a cell phone. (Our client was run off the road and struck a tree. She was airlifted to the hospital, and thus was in no condition to take photographs at the scene.) We are awaiting a court date to compel production of the photographs. (This lawyer has also refused to provide cell phone information to determine if his client was using his phone at the time of the crash. We are seeking this material as well.) A third driver readily produced, through her lawyer, photographs of her vehicle taken at the repair shop.
Sadly, not all lawyers are decent people.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Judges will require more than unverified claims that the seeking party is unable to obtain the substantial equivalent of the work product material without undue hardship. At the very least the attorney for the moving party should file a verified motion in which the claim is asserted. In addition, at the hearing on the motion the lawyer should ask the judge to swear him or her in so as to add greater import to the allegations of need and hardship. Finally, affidavits of people in the know can be used to establish the moving party’s position.
The work product privilege sits on highly fortified ground. One must be well-armed when seeking to breach its walls.
