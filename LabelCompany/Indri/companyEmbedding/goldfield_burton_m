Since 2008, Burton M. Goldfield has served as President and CEO of TriNet, a strategic partner to small businesses for payroll, HR, benefits, employment law compliance and risk reduction.
Burton has more than 25 years of experience in sales, operational, and technology leadership positions and is known for driving product innovation and business growth. Since joining TriNet, Burton has transformed the company into a leading cloud-based HR provider and Professional Employer Organization (PEO). With offices throughout America, TriNet serves more than 10,000 clients with 272,000+ worksite employees (as of 09/30/14). Its services allow small businesses to regain focus on executing their visions and growing their businesses while TriNet manages their payroll taxes, day-to-day HR, employment law compliance, and conformity with the Affordable Care Act. TriNet’s net revenue exceeded $400M in 2013 and has more than quadrupled during Burton’s tenure. To expand TriNet’s market reach and strengthen the company’s ability to serve more clients than ever before, he led the company to acquire Gevity, AccordHR, SOI, ExpenseCloud and Ambrose. In addition, Burton invested heavily in the company’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technology platform, leveraging his background from Hyperion as well as IBM Corporation’s Rational Software. One of the outcomes of TriNet’s growth was an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in March 2014 followed by a secondary offering in September 2014. TriNet is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol TNET.
Prior to TriNet, Burton was CEO at Ketera Technologies, a Santa Clara-based SaaS provider to FORTUNE 2000 companies. Before that, Burton served as senior vice president, worldwide field operations at Hyperion Solutions Corporation and vice president of worldwide sales for IBM Corporation’s Rational Software division. Burton received a bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Syracuse University and an MBA from Villanova University. In 2010, the San Francisco Business Times named him a Most Admired CEO.

Summary



Since joining TriNet Group, Inc., in 2008, Burton Goldfield has  led the introduction of nearly two dozen human resources (HR) services  and products. As Chief Executive Officer of the San Leandro, California,  HR outsourcing company, Burton Goldfield provides tools for small  companies to attract and retain top-quality employees through tailored  benefits packages. His firm additionally advises on human capital  strategies that allow companies to compete effectively with larger  corporate entities. Mr. Goldfield graduated from Syracuse  University with a Bachelor of Science in Bio-Medical Engineering,  subsequently earning his Master of Business Administration at Villanova  University. He guided a number of technology firms in the areas of  operations and corporate strategy over the next 20 years. Joining  Rational Software in the late 1980s, he helped lead the firm’s growth  over the next 14 years from $19 million to $700 million. Following the  company’s 2003 acquisition by IBM Corporation, he served for a year as  IBM’s Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Rational Software Division. Burton  Goldfield’s next executive role was as Hyperion Solutions Corporation’s  Senior Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations. His guidance of  the business-performance management software leader’s expansion efforts  led to a $3.3 billion acquisition by Oracle Corporation in 2007. Prior  to joining TriNet Group, Mr. Goldfield served as CEO with the SaaS  (software as a service) provider Ketera Technologies, Inc. He continues  to emphasize technological solutions with his current firm, having  recently enhanced its SaaS capabilities, as well as its overall  technological infrastructure. An animal lover, Burton Goldfield supports greyhound rescues and the humane efforts of the no-kill Best Friends Animal Society.





Outsourcing HR Helps Small Businesses Improve Benefits, Save Money 



Burton Goldfield has held the post of president and CEO of TriNet  since 2008. In this role, Burton Goldfield helps small companies  outsource their human resources function, allowing them to concentrate  on core competencies while putting human resources duties in the hands  of the company’s specialized staff.Small companies benefit  significantly from outsourcing the HR function, as they are often too  small to have an entire HR department. Private Employer Organizations  (PEOs) such as TriNet take on issues of compliance, relieving the  employer of what can often be daunting regulatory burdens.One  significant area where PEOs such as Burton Goldfield’s company, TriNet,  can add value for small businesses is in benefits. With over 7,000  clients and 200,000 employees under its care, TriNet possesses insurance  buying power that small companies lack and passes on those savings to  its clients. In addition, the company’s economies of scale also  permit the introduction of multiple benefit plans, allowing employers to  offer more choices to their workers. By providing better benefits  through PEOs, small companies enhance their competitive position  relative to larger ones, something Burton Goldfield is committed to  achieving for his clients.





TriNet Acquisition of Strategic Outsourcing a Success



Burton Goldfield is the president and CEO of TriNet, a leading  provider of outsourced HR services to small businesses. Under the  leadership of Burton Goldfield, TriNet helps companies save money, time,  and energy by delivering solutions for employee benefits, payroll  processing, recruiting, and other critical HR functions. By  acquiring Strategic Outsourcing Inc last October, TriNet made progress  on its goal to offer more industry-specific services to small and  emerging businesses throughout the country. The integration of the  company has allowed Strategic Outsourcing Inc clients to experience  higher quality products and improved customer service, and clients have  responded with positive feedback. Representatives from companies such as  Jagged Peak, an ecommerce software provider, and Body Logic MD, a  hormone replacement health care organization, have spoken highly of  TriNet’s assistance with employment law compliance and employee benefits  administration.  Earlier this year, TriNet acquired Ambrose  Employer Group, as the company looks to further enhance its services in  the financial services sector.

 TriNet Releases Next Generation HR Passport by Burton Goldfield
 Named by San Francisco Business Times as the Most Admired CEO in 2010, Burton Goldfield is president and chief executive officer of TriNet, a human resources (HR) outsourcing firm. Since joining the company in 2008, Goldfield has significantly increased revenue. In a challenging economic climate, he invested in his firm’s technology platform and increased the company’s client base to 7,000. The company’s achievements under his leadership include a cloud-based solution for HR management and events processing.    Using feedback from customers and the initial success of the first HR Passport, TriNet added innovative enhancements with such features as real-time events-processing capabilities and improved interface usability. The next generation provides sophisticated workflow functionality and simplifies how employees and businesses navigate and manage HR operations. The management system is available to clients with mobile apps for iOS (iPhone operating system) and Android devices.     Launched in the spring of 2013, the improved HR Passport represents the company’s commitment to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses. Rich with features and a sleek new design, the next generation HR Passport leads the industry with customer functionality in payroll, benefits administration, and other human resources processes. 





 Burton M. Goldfield President and Chief Executive Officer
 Entrepreneurs are solving the world’s most challenging issues, and Burton Goldfield is thrilled to be a part of it as President and CEO of TriNet, a company that cultivates HR partnerships to help its 7,000 clients make the world a better place. “Entrepreneurs don’t start businesses to make sure every aspect of employment law and processes are followed. But those activities are essential, and that’s where we come in. But we don’t have your typical vendor relationship; we are a trusted advisor as it relates to the most important aspect of our clients business, their human capital. I am humbled by how much our clients rely on us so they can build their dreams.”     Burton has led TriNet to become the largest independent cloud based HR provider leveraging the PEO model to help grow small businesses. He is known for driving product innovation and growth. Revenue has exceeded $250M in 2012, more than tripling during his tenure. TriNet currently services more than 175,000 employees through its 50+ regional offices located throughout the US. Burton has invested heavily in the company’s SaaS technology platform leveraging his background at Hyperion (HYSL), IBM and Rational Software (RATL).    Burton received a bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering from Syracuse University and an MBA from Villanova University. In 2010, he was named a Most Admired CEO by the San Francisco Business Times. 




 Nearly All North American Companies Plan to Use SaaS 
 Burton Goldfield is the current president and chief executive  officer of TriNet, the largest independent cloud-based HR provider in  the country. TriNet has multiple offices throughout America and more  than 7,000 clients with nearly 200,000 employees. With TriNet human  resources outsourcing services, business owners can leave HR issues like  employee retention and employment law compliance to professionals and  focus more time on their marketing strategies and product development.  Burton Goldfield, always looking to the future, has heavily invested  into software-as-a-service (SaaS) technologies.  Software-as-a-service  (SaaS) technologies is a term used to describe any software that is  delivered to clients remotely as a web- or cloud-based function. There  are a number of benefits to SaaS programs, including low monthly fees,  no further investments in related hardware, and direct customer service  and troubleshooting assistance. The SaaS industry is currently  experiencing significant growth, particularly in North America. Siemer  &amp; Associates, an Internet and digital media firm, recently conducted  an extensive study that revealed 83% of all business plans either  already use or are in the process of adopting some form of SaaS  technology. The SaaS market will grow nearly 17% in the next 12 months.  By 2015, the market could be valued at more than $21 billion.  




 The National Parks Conservation Association and Non-Partisan Advocacy 
 Burton Goldfield, though CEO and president of TriNet, does not  confine his interests to the business realm. A passion for conservation  has led him to act for the last three years as a member of the National  Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). Burton Goldfield serves on the  Pacific regional council for the 31 national parks along the western  border of the United States.  The NPCA was founded in 1919, only  three years after the establishment of the National Parks Service. The  original purpose of this organization was to act as an advocate for  national parks while functioning independently, outside of any political  agenda. Though nearly a century has passed, the NPCA continues its  non-partisan efforts to preserve and improve the American parks system.  Particularly important to the NPCA is maintaining clean air and water  and protecting the various natural ecosystems of the parks in all 50  states.   The National Parks Conservation Association currently has over 750,000 members and supporters and 25 offices throughout the U.S.
