Biography
James Doti earned his B.S. degree in economics from the University of Illinois, Chicago, and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago. He was appointed president of Chapman University in 1991 and served for 25 years.  In September 2016, he returned to the Chapman faculty.  He holds the Donald Bren Distinguished Chair in Business and Economics.Dr. Doti joined the Chapman faculty in 1974.  In 1978, he founded the A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research to provide data, facilities and support to encourage faculty and students to engage in research of high quality, and to widely disseminate the results.  The Center’s inaugural Orange County Forecast, presented in December 1978, was the first economic forecast in the U.S. to be based on an urban econometric model. The Economic Forecast has continued to be a main focus of the Anderson Center’s work, growing in scope and widely recognized for its statistical accuracy.  Over the 2004 through 2014 period, Chapman’s real GDP forecasts were more accurate than the forecasts issued by all 30 agencies participating in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators surveys.  The Chapman forecast model also outperformed the highly regarded Blue Chip Consensus forecast.Dr. Doti’s articles have appeared in academic journals as well as periodicals such as The Wall Street Journal and The Chronicle of Higher Education.   His frequent op-eds appear in the Orange County Register, and he is a regular columnist for Orange County Business Journal.  He is also the co-author of two econometrics texts and co-editor of a collection of readings in free enterprise that received the Templeton Honor Award for Scholarly Excellence. Dr. Doti is a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. He has completed 60 marathons and climbed five of the world’s famed Seven Summits. He is also an avid reader and writer.  His first children’s book, A Christmas Adventure in Little Italy, was published in 2010 and became a Sons of Italy Book Club selection.  His second, Jimmy Finds His Voice, came out in January 2013.  The final installment of the “Jimmy Trilogy,” I Love You This Much, Nonna, is forthcoming in 2017.

						Milton Friedman, recipient of the 1976 Nobel Prize for economic science, speaks May 9, 2002 during a White House event in Washington, DC. 		

By James L. Doti | bgazzar@scng.com | Daily NewsJuly 31, 2013 at 12:00 amAt Chapman University we have a bust of Milton Friedman that commemorates the establishment of an endowed chair in his honor.
When I contacted my former professor of Money I, II and III and asked him to select a quote of his to be engraved on the pedestal of his bust, Professor Friedman gave me the following: “A society that puts equality ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom… a society that puts freedom first will, as a happy by-product, end up with both greater freedom and greater equality.”
When someone chooses a statement that will leave an enduring legacy, surely it must embody the essence of that person’s philosophical beliefs. I strongly believe that was the case in Professor Friedman’s personal selection of the above passage from “Free to Choose,” the book he co-authored with his wife, to memorialize the idea about which he was most passionate – the idea that freedom is the essence of life and our pursuit of happiness.
The power behind Friedman’s championing of freedom was such that the world community took note. In the early 1980s, Milton and Rose Friedman’s “Free to Choose” became one of PBS’ most watched video series. It attracted audiences abroad, including communist countries where it was smuggled. Indeed, many astute thinkers believe that the intellectual foundation behind the fall of the Berlin Wall finds its roots in “Free to Choose.”
In commenting on his global travels with his wife, Rose, Professor Friedman identified a central theme of “Free to Choose.”
“Wherever we found any large element of individual freedom, some beauty in the ordinary life of man, some measure of real progress in the material comforts at his disposal, and a life filled with hope of further progress in the future – there we also found that the private market was the main device being used to organize economic activity,” he commented.
On his birthday today, I will do what I truly believe my teacher, mentor and friend would have wanted more than anything else. I will place a rose next to his bust, not for him but in honor of the love of his wife, Rose. A rose for a Rose.
James L. Doti is president and Donald Bren Distinguished Chair of Business and Economics at Chapman University in Orange.

James L. Doti













                    
                    James Doti earned a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago.  He has served since 1991 as president of Chapman University, where he also holds the Donald Bren Distinguished Chair of Business and Economics. He is the co-author of two econometrics texts and co-editor of a collection of readings in free enterprise—"The Market Economy"—that received the Templeton Honor Award for Scholarly Excellence.  Jim also collaborated with illustrator Lisa Mertins on two children’s books, based on his childhood in Chicago’s Little Italy.  "A Christmas Adventure in Little Italy" (2010) appeared on Amazon.com’s list of Best Children’s Holiday Books and was a Sons of Italy Book Club selection.  His second book, "Jimmy Finds His Voice" (2013), was described by Kirkus Reviews: "In this touching autobiographical picture book, a young boy discovers that enthusiasm can trump his speech impediment.… The illustrations by Mertins are wholly appealing…. A charming story with delightful pictures ideal for reading together."

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→James DotiIN THE NEWSJames DotiMORE STORIES ABOUT:AcquisitionsManagementWalt Disney CoBill ClintonForecasts| MoreFEATURED ARTICLESBUSINESSJames Doti Becomes Dean at Chapman CollegeSeptember 12, 1985 James Doti, an economics professor and founder of Chapman College's Center for Economic Research, has been promoted to Dean of the college's School of Business and Management. The promotion was announced this week by college president G.T. Smith, who praised Doti's work as a teacher at the college and as a researcher of economic and business trends.ARTICLES BY DATENEWSEngineering Chapman From the Sidings to the Fast TrackOctober 22, 2000 | JEFF GOTTLIEB, TIMES STAFF WRITER Not long ago, Chapman University was the kid snoozing in the lecture hall, unmotivated and without prospects. If anyone outside Orange County had heard of Chapman, it was usually because of its World Campus Afloat, a cruise ship that used to take students on semester-long trips. But the ship was let go in the 1970s to help pay debts.Advertisement


NEWSVariables All Add Up to Good News for DemocratDecember 3, 1999 | RUSS STANTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER A forecast of economic variables adds up to a Democrat remaining in the White House after next year's election, according to Chapman University forecasters. An equation that uses changes in real gross domestic product and the consumer price index correctly predicted the winning candidate in 19 of the last 25 presidential elections, said James L. Doti, Chapman University president and holder of the Donald Bren Distinguished Chair in Business and Economics.BUSINESSTOURISM :  Business 'Will Be 5% Better Than Horrible,' Economist PredictsJuly 23, 1993 | Chris Woodward, Times staff writer During Chapman University's recent economic forecast update, economist James Doti--who doubles as the private school's president, predicted that tourism will increase by about 5% during 1993. When reminded just how lousy business has been for many in the tourism industry, Doti quickly responded that "it will be 5% better than horrible."CALIFORNIA | LOCALExport Lawyers and Eco-MoralistsJune 22, 1997Regarding Kenneth L. Khachigian's column, "Time to Stand Up to Elitist Eco-Moralists," and James L. Doti's Orange County Voices column, "Trip to Russia Proves Why We Need Lawyers," May 25:    Occasionally, issues come together in The Times, columns that seem to shout out wonderful solutions! The proximity of articles by my friends James Doti and Ken Khachigian are a case in point.    By any objective standard, we as a country are oppressively overburdened by an overabundance of both lawyers and eco-moralists.NEWSPopular Professor Named President of Chapman CollegeJune 13, 1991 |  From a Times Staff Writer Chapman College on Wednesday named a popular campus professor and well-known economic forecaster as its 12th president, quickly replacing the chief executive who resigned this week. The new president, Chicago native James L. Doti, 44, has had two previous stints as acting president of the small, Christian, liberal arts college. He received spirited standing ovations from students and professors Wednesday at two campus gatherings held to introduce him. He replaces Allen E.BUSINESSRetailFebruary 2, 1994 | Greg Johnson / Times staff writer Honored Prophet: When James L. Doti speaks, does Washington listen? During an early morning session Monday with the California Restaurant Assn.'s Orange County chapter, Doti predicted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan would move soon to keep inflation under control. Later that same day, Greenspan warned Congress that it might be necessary to raise interest rates to prevent a spurt of inflation.NEWSChapman President Revises His Prediction, Picks ClintonOctober 30, 1992 | JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER In December, Chapman University President James Doti crunched some numbers and predicted that President Bush would win reelection by a landslide. In June he updated his prediction to account for Ross Perot, and reduced Bush's margin of victory to 9 percentage points. On Thursday, a sheepish Doti revised his prediction once again: Democratic candidate Bill Clinton will win the presidency by a hair.NEWSChapman Sees Cool-Down in O.C. EconomyDecember 3, 1999 | MARC BALLON, TIMES STAFF WRITER Orange County's strong economy will weaken a bit in 2000 as the construction market cools, consumer debt hits historic levels and higher interest rates slow the national economy, Chapman University economists said Thursday. The expanding housing market, in particular, will taper off, but perhaps not enough for most residents, according to the university's closely watched annual economic forecast.BUSINESSChapman Sees Slower Pace in Growth of Home ValuesJanuary 13, 1999 | DARYL STRICKLAND, Daryl Strickland covers real estate for The Times. He can be reached at (714) 966-5670, and at daryl.strickland@latimes.com After one of the biggest surges ever last year, prices of existing homes in Orange County will climb at a much slower pace this year, Chapman University President James L. Doti said. Housing prices should move up about 4.6% this year, less than half the gains last year, when the market was fueled by high job growth, record low interest rates and exceptional gains in the stock market, said Doti, co-author of the university's annual economic forecast for the county.NEWSChapman Has Eye on O.C.'s Economic TackDecember 3, 1998 | PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER Twenty years ago, Chapman University economist James L. Doti presided over the school's first forecast of the Orange County economy. About two dozen people showed up, most of them trustees of the Orange-based school. From those humble beginnings, a local phenomenon emerged. Equal parts meticulous econometrics and masterful marketing, the Chapman forecast has become an annual rite of the Orange County business community.CALIFORNIA | LOCALExport Lawyers and Eco-MoralistsJune 22, 1997Regarding Kenneth L. Khachigian's column, "Time to Stand Up to Elitist Eco-Moralists," and James L. Doti's Orange County Voices column, "Trip to Russia Proves Why We Need Lawyers," May 25:    Occasionally, issues come together in The Times, columns that seem to shout out wonderful solutions! The proximity of articles by my friends James Doti and Ken Khachigian are a case in point.    By any objective standard, we as a country are oppressively overburdened by an overabundance of both lawyers and eco-moralists.CALIFORNIA | LOCAL'Exciting Time' for ChapmanDecember 4, 1996 | LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER Calling it "the most exciting time" in Chapman University's history, President James L. Doti said Tuesday that enrollment is fast increasing while classes remain small and ethnic diversity goals are being reached. Doti, in his annual State of the University address, said that Chapman has expanded without compromising its small-town charm, broadened curricula and succeeded in attracting minority students without using a quota system or different standards of admission.NEWSTrying Not to Forfeit Their IntegrityNovember 3, 1996 | MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER On the campus of Chapman University, autumn is as prominent as the bronze busts of Albert Schweitzer and Martin Luther King Jr. The air is crisp and cool, leaves have begun falling from the canopy of sycamores dotting the campus, and football is on everyone's mind. But, oh, how a mood can change. The atmosphere went from sunny to dark last week, in the motion of a single deed. Acting on his own volition, Chapman President James L. Doti forfeited the football team's five victories in 1996.NEWSVariables All Add Up to Good News for DemocratDecember 3, 1999 | RUSS STANTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER A forecast of economic variables adds up to a Democrat remaining in the White House after next year's election, according to Chapman University forecasters. An equation that uses changes in real gross domestic product and the consumer price index correctly predicted the winning candidate in 19 of the last 25 presidential elections, said James L. Doti, Chapman University president and holder of the Donald Bren Distinguished Chair in Business and Economics.BUSINESSSlowed Economic Pace Expected to Last a YearJune 15, 1985 | CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer Orange County's economy, which last year grew at a feverish rate, has slowed substantially this year and will remain at that slackened pace for at least the next year. And that's the good news from the semi-annual economic forecast unveiled by the Chapman College Center for Economic Research.1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |  NextSPORTSChapman President Reaches Out, Keeps Autry From Being TouchedJune 21, 1996 | MARTIN BECK At its best, baseball can bring out the kid in adults, even university presidents. Witness the story Jim Doti, a noted economist and president at Chapman University in Orange, is telling this week: Doti, who helped mediate the deal between Disney and Anaheim that cleared the way for Disney to buy controlling interest in the Angels, was invited to watch Monday's game against the Chicago White Sox from Gene and Jackie Autry's private box at Anaheim Stadium.NEWSHow Disney-Anaheim Deal Came Back From the DeadApril 5, 1996 | MARK PLATTE and CHRIS FOSTER and GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS Last Friday, six men stood around a conference table in Orange and decided the future of the California Angels. It wasn't Camp David, it was Chapman University. But President James Doti may well have been a latter-day Jimmy Carter, helping to break the impasse between Walt Disney Co. and the city of Anaheim. Just two weeks before, the company's Disney Sports Enterprises had publicly declared negotiations with city officials dead. Angel owner Jackie Autry was threatening to move the team.1 | 2 | 3 |  NextCopyright 2017 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy
