About
This is Canaan.
Canaan is an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in visionaries with transformative ideas. While we love speedy success, we’re acutely aware that greatness comes in many forms and at different times. That’s why we’re not afraid to break the mold to bring something spectacular to life.











About
This is Canaan.


Canaan is an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in visionaries with transformative ideas. While we love speedy success, we’re acutely aware that greatness comes in many forms and at different times. That’s why we’re not afraid to break the mold to bring something spectacular to life.








Our approach is personal.
We don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach, but there are a few absolutes intrinsic to who we are and how we work. And these values weren’t contrived out of thin air, they’re hard earned over the past 30 years and counting.






01


High performance, low ego.
The old adage “actions speak louder than words” rings true within Canaan’s walls, and in our interactions with companies out in the wild. Words like "understated" and "effective" are often used to describe our partners, and that’s fine by us. We’ll leave the bragging to the others. 


“Seasoned investors can be very arrogant, but Canaan is no BS, unassuming, and humble—no hysteria, no angst.”— Michael Gilman, CEO Arrakis




02


People are more than statistics.
A diverse team means we bring varied perspectives to the table. And that table welcomes out-of-the-box thinking, spirited debate, and people from all walks of life. It’s our individual backgrounds and interests that inform our collective approach, which spans industries, generations, and coasts. In short, our diversity is who we are and what we do. 


“There's a lot of talk about diversity on boards, but it’s great to have a smart strong woman in a leadership position on mine.”— Michael Laskoff, CEO Annum




03


We ask for help, and so should you.
We firmly believe that two heads are better than one. So while our investors thrive in 1:1 partnerships, our companies also have the support of the entire Canaan team whenever, wherever. Recruiting your executive team? We’ll mobilize our full network. Need operational advice to bring a product to market? We’ll connect you with the right partner or colleague. Our resources are yours. 


“Even if Canaan hadn’t funded us, just going through the process with them – the discussions we had and the questions they asked – already made us a better company. And that’s amazing.”— Julie Wainwright, CEO The Real Real




04


The Golden Rule still applies.
We treat you like we treat ourselves—with respect, transparency, and honesty—even if it’s sometimes not what you want to hear. It’s this approach that makes our portfolio companies more like family, because we’re not afraid to get in the weeds and help solve big hairy problems. In fact, it’s what we live for. We’re acutely aware that our success hinges on your success, so we do what it takes. 


“We made big strategic shifts as a company and worked closely with Maha through all of them. Canaan is really smart about the way they get involved and how they support you through good times and bad.”— Kevin Chou, former CEO Kabam




05


Meddling is for mothers, not investors.
We’d be lying if we said we weren’t hands-on, but we also know when to step back and let you soar. Our goal is to add value to your process, and help you grow in ways you couldn’t alone. That’s why you’ll never see us booking meetings just to check a box or “see how are things are going.” We’ll already know, because that’s the kind of relationship we have with our companies.


“Rich is an amazing thought partner. His real world operational expertise has been tremendously valuable as we've scaled.  Having this type of access to the Canaan team has been an incredible benefit to our team.”— John Kobs, CEO Apartment List






We've been busy.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Entrepreneur and investor Ross Fubini, who’s been a partner with seed-stage investor Kapor Capital for the past year, has joined Canaan Partners as a venture partner. Fubini, who’s listed as an advisor to Palantir Technologies, led investments in Piazza, CitrusLane, GingerIO, KarmaLoop, ElationEMR, Omada Health and HealthLoop and others while at Kapor Capital. He also co-founded social software startup Cubetree, which was acquired in 2010 by SuccessFactors, where Fubini remained and served as vice president. Fubini told peHUB that he will focus on the consumerization of the enterprise, health care IT deals and work with the seed investment community to fund deals. Canaan’s seed deals are typically in the $500,000 to $1 million range. At Canaan, venture partner is a full investment partner position, and Fubini says he’s on the GP track. 
PRESS RELEASE
Canaan Partners Adds Ross Fubini as Venture Partner
Successful entrepreneur, tech executive, and investor with over 15 years operational experience will help identify and support early-stage technology investments at Canaan
Menlo Park, CA – November 13, 2012 – Canaan Partners, a leading global venture capital firm, today announced that Ross Fubini will join the firm as venture partner.  Fubini has over 15 years experience as a founder, technology executive, investor and startup advisor and will play an integral role in identifying and backing early-stage technology deals at Canaan. 





“Ross is a real star in the startup community and has a strong network across seed and early-stage companies,” said John Balen, general partner at Canaan Partners. “Canaan has a long history of identifying extraordinary entrepreneurs with great ideas and then working to build these companies into durable companies.  Ross will be a tremendous addition to our team as we continue to seek out visionary early-stage companies.”
“This is an exciting time to join Canaan Partners,” said Fubini. “I made the jump from a seed-stage firm to Canaan because it not your typical, large Silicon Valley VC firm.  The nimble and collaborative team at Canaan understands the importance of investing in early-stage companies and supporting them for the long haul, and I look forward to helping identify the next global leaders in consumer, enterprise and healthcare IT.”
Canaan successfully raised its ninth fund, Canaan Partners IX, with $600 million in funding in January 2012 and is actively investing in digital media, consumer Internet, enterprise, mobile, biopharmaceuticals and healthcare infrastructure companies.  The firm has recently funded companies such as UrbanSitter, TheRealReal, borro, Instacart, adverCar and CytomX Therapeutics.
Prior to joining Canaan, Fubini was a partner at seed-stage technology investment firm Kapor Capital, where he led investments in Piazza, CitrusLane, GingerIO, KarmaLoop, ElationEMR, Omada Health and HealthLoop.  At Kapor, Fubini was known for identifying passionate entrepreneurs, then working with them to build product-driven companies with global market opportunities.  He has also served as an advisor to several high-growth technology companies, including Palantir Technologies, now a large private company valued at nearly $4 billion, and Facebook Causes. 





“We brought Ross in as an early advisor because he is a skilled serial operator who can actually develop senior talent and work through challenges from ideas to execution, said Shyam Sankar, director of forward deployed engineering at Palantir Technologies.  “He instantly understood our core vision and offered insights, strategic guidance and access to his network to help Palantir scale to what it is today.”
Previously, Ross was a successful entrepreneur who co-founded and grew Cubetree, an enterprise social collaboration company, which was acquired by SuccessFactors in 2010 and where he then served as a vice president.  Ross also was a senior director of engineering at Symantec, where he was in charge of product development for anti-spam, anti-virus and content filtering product lines serving 70,000 customers and delivering $300M+ in annual revenue.  Before Symantec, Fubini held technical leadership roles at BEA/Plumtree, TellMe Networks and Netscape.  He holds a B.S. in engineering and art minor from Carnegie Mellon University.
About Canaan Partners
Canaan Partners invests in entrepreneurs and works alongside them to turn visionary ideas into valuable companies.  Since 1987, the firm has catalyzed the growth of disruptive technology startups and healthcare companies revolutionizing the practice of medicine.  With $3.4 billion under management and more than 91 acquisitions and 54 IPOs to date, Canaan has funded companies such as Acme Packet, Associated Content (acquired by Yahoo), CommerceOne, DoubleClick (acquired by Google), ID Analytics (acquired by LifeLock), Match.com (acquired by IAC), SandForce (acquired by LSI) and SuccessFactors (acquired by SAP), as well as notable healthcare companies such as Advanced BioHealing (acquired by Shire), BiPar Sciences (acquired by Sanofi) and Elevation Pharmaceutics (acquired by Sunovion).   Current technology investments include Blurb, KABAM, Lending Club, Performance Marketing Brands, SOASTA, Tremor Video and Zoosk in the U.S.; BharatMatrimony and UnitedLex in India; and PrimeSense and LiveU in Israel.  The Canaan healthcare portfolio includes emerging leaders such as Liquidia Technologies, Civitas Therapeutics and DICOM Grid.  Canaan maintains a presence in the global innovation hubs of Silicon Valley, New York City, India and Israel.  For more information visit www.canaan.com or www.facebook.com/canaanpartners.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
