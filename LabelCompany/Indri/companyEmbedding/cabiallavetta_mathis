Master Degree in Economics 


Queen’s University

                  Queen's University at Kingston (commonly shortened to Queen's University or Queen's) is a public research university located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Founded on 16 October 1841, the university predated the founding of Canada by 26 years. Queen's holds more than 1,400 hectares (3,500 acres) of land throughout Ontario and owns Herstmonceux Castle in East Sussex, England. Queen's is organized into ten undergraduate, graduate and professional faculties and schools.

The Church of Scotland established Queen's College in 1841 with a royal charter from Queen Victoria. The first classes, intended to prepare students for the ministry, were held 7 March 1842 with 13 students and two professors. Queen's was the first university west of the maritime provinces to admit women, and to form a student government. In 1883, a women's college for medical education affiliated with Queen's University. In 1888, Queen's University began offering extension courses, becoming the first Canadian university to do so. In 1912, Queen's secularized and changed to its present legal name.

BlackRock Appoints Mathis Cabiallavetta to Board of Directors | Business Wire


























































BlackRock Appoints Mathis Cabiallavetta to Board of Directors






September 25, 2007 11:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) today announced the addition of Mathis 
      Cabiallavetta to its Board of Directors. The addition of Mr. 
      Cabiallavetta brings the total number of directors to 17, 10 of whom are 
      independent and not affiliated with the Company.
    


      Mr. Cabiallavetta is Vice Chairman, Office of the Chief Executive 
      Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC), Chairman of MMC 
      International, and since 1994 a member of MMC’s 
      International Advisory Board. Prior to joining MMC in 1999, Mr. 
      Cabiallavetta was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Union Bank of 
      Switzerland (UBS A.G.). He joined UBS in 1971 and held numerous 
      positions before becoming Executive Vice President and a member of the 
      Group Executive Board in 1992 with responsibility for Trading & Sales, 
      Risk Management Services and the International Division. He became 
      president of the Group Executive Board in 1996 and was elected chairman 
      of UBS A.G. in 1998. Mr. Cabiallavetta is also a member of the Board of 
      Altria Group, Inc.
    

“Adding a director of Mathis’ 
      caliber to the Board is a great win for BlackRock," commented Laurence 
      D. Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Mathis 
      brings the benefit of his broad experience managing a global franchise 
      and his insights will be invaluable in navigating BlackRock’s 
      continued growth.”

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may 
      contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s 
      future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. 
      Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases 
      such as “trend,” “potential,”
“opportunity,” “pipeline,”
“believe,” “comfortable,”
“expect,” “anticipate,”
“current,” “intention,”
“estimate,” “position,”
“assume,” “outlook,”
“continue,” “remain,”
“maintain,” “sustain,”
“seek,” “achieve,” 
      and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,”
“would,” “should,”
“could,” “may” 
      or similar expressions.
    

      BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to 
      numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. 
      Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and 
      BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update 
      forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from 
      those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could 
      differ materially from historical performance.
    

      In addition to factors previously disclosed in BlackRock's SEC reports 
      and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following 
      factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from forward-looking statements or historical performance: (1) the 
      introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and 
      strategies; (2) changes in political, economic or industry conditions, 
      the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which 
      could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the 
      value of assets under management; (3) the relative and absolute 
      investment performance of BlackRock's investment products, including its 
      separately managed accounts and the former MLIM business; (4) the impact 
      of increased competition; (5) the impact of capital improvement 
      projects; (6) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (7) the 
      unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (8) the extent and timing 
      of any share repurchases; (9) the impact, extent and timing of 
      technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property 
      protection; (10) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and 
      reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government 
      agencies relating to BlackRock, Merrill Lynch or PNC; (11) terrorist 
      activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the 
      general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, 
      specific industries and BlackRock; (12) the ability to attract and 
      retain highly talented professionals; (13) fluctuations in foreign 
      currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the value of 
      advisory fees earned by BlackRock; (14) the impact of changes to tax 
      legislation and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (15) 
      BlackRock's ability to successfully integrate the MLIM business with its 
      existing business; (16) the ability of BlackRock to effectively manage 
      the former MLIM assets along with its historical assets under 
      management; (17) BlackRock's success in maintaining the distribution of 
      its products; and (18) the ability of BlackRock to consummate the 
      transaction with Quellos and realize the benefits of such transaction.
    

      BlackRock's Annual Reports on Form 10-K and BlackRock's subsequent 
      filings with the SEC, accessible on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov 
      and on BlackRock’s website at http://www.blackrock.com, 
      discuss these factors in more detail and identify additional factors 
      that can affect forward-looking statements. The information contained on 
      our website is not a part of this press release.
