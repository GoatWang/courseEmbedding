Investment Objective
The Context Macro Opportunities Fund seeks total return with low correlation to broad financial markets. Total return consists of capital appreciation and income.
Category
Multi–alternative — the Context Macro Opportunities Fund is a single-manager, multi-strategy fund.
Investment Overview:
The Fund seeks to uncover value and mitigate risk utilizing disciplined decision making.

Top-down macro, thematic approach seeks non-directional market risks with asymmetric outcomes
Strategy uses high-quality, liquid fixed income markets to target unique return profile: asset-backed, credit, fixed income-related equities, mortgage, municipal, swaps/options, treasury
Relative value focus

The Fund employs a number of arbitrage and alternative investment strategies to pursue its investment objective and may have exposure to long and short positions across all of its asset classes. In order to pursue these strategies, the Fund may invest in a wide range of debt securities and derivative instruments. The Fund may also invest in equity securities and equity-linked derivative instruments.
The Subadviser’s investment strategies include, but not limited to, the following:

Break-Even Inflation Trading: The Subadviser may take a “break-even inflation” position by trading inflation-linked securities against their nominal bond equivalent. The resulting spread will generally be neutral to changes in interest rates.
Capital Structure Arbitrage: The Subadviser will enter into relative value trades in senior tranches of credit default indices positioned against subordinated tranches.
Hedged Mortgage-Backed Securities Trading: The Subadviser may seek to capture value resulting from differences in views related to prepayment characteristics.
Volatility Spread Trading: The Subadviser may seek to capture mispricing in volatility by taking offsetting positions in two or more option-related instruments.
Opportunistic Investing: The Subadviser may employ other arbitrage and alternative strategies when it believes attractive market opportunities arise.


*Context Advisers II, L.P. (the “Adviser”) has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse Fund expenses to limit Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding all taxes, interest, portfolio transaction expenses, dividend and interest expense on short sales, acquired fund fees and expenses, proxy expenses and extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole discretion of the Adviser)) of Investor Shares, Advisory Shares and Institutional Shares to 2.14%, 1.99% and 1.89%, respectively, through April 30, 2017 (the “Expense Cap”).

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information about the Fund is in the prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by calling 1-855-612-2257. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested.  Risks are detailed in the prospectus and include, but are not limited to, the following:

Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are subject to risk of prepayment. These types of securities may also decline in value because of mortgage foreclosures or defaults on the underlying obligations.
Credit default swap agreements involve special risks because they may be difficult to value, are highly susceptible to liquidity and credit risk, and generally pay a return only in the event of an actual default by the issuer of the underlying obligation (as opposed to a credit downgrade or other indication of financial difficulty).
Investments in futures contracts involve additional costs, may be more volatile than other investments and may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed. The prices of futures can be highly volatile, using futures can lower total return and the potential loss from futures can exceed the Fund’s initial investment.
The Fund may use derivatives (including futures, options, swap agreements and forward contracts) to enhance returns or hedge against market declines. The Fund's derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Fund, which creates the possibility that the loss on such instruments may be greater than the gain in the value in the Fund.
Investing in foreign companies involves certain risks not generally associated with investments in the securities of U.S. companies. In addition, individual international country economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product, rates of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources, self-sufficiency and balance of payments position.
Emerging markets investments are subject to additional risks due to greater political and economic uncertainties as well as a relative lack of information about companies in such markets.
Hedging is a strategy in which the Fund uses a derivative to offset the risks associated with other Fund holdings. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging strategy will reduce risk or that hedging transactions will be either available or cost effective.
The Fund may incur leverage by borrowing directly or by making investments in reverse repurchase agreements. The use of leverage has the risk of capital losses that exceed the net assets of the Fund. Employing leverage will cause the net asset value of the Fund to be more volatile and sensitive to market movements. Leverage may involve the creation of a liability that requires the Fund to pay interest.
The Fund is "non-diversified", investing in fewer securities at any one time than a diversified fund. A decline in the value of or default by a single issuer makes the Fund more susceptible to financial, economic or market events impacting such issuer.
Short selling involves unlimited risk including the possibility that losses to the Fund may exceed the original amount it invested.
Investments in small and medium capitalization companies may be less liquid and their securities’ prices may fluctuate more than those of larger, more established companies.
Newly-organized Funds have no assurance that active trading markets will be developed or maintained.

About Context Capital
 

Context Capital Management, LLC is an SEC-registered alternative asset management firm based in La Jolla, California and Jupiter, Florida. Our firm looks for asymmetric return profiles, opportunities where downside risk is protected and upside can be exploited. Specifically, we specialize in fixed income and relative-value strategies with a focus on event-driven credit trades. Trades are most typically constructed with long convertible and/or corporate bonds and short common stock positions. 

 



We strive to achieve consistent absolute rates of return with an emphasis on the preservation of capital via rigorous risk management and a diversified portfolio.  Context pursues a number of synergistic investment strategies with diverse themes and return drivers. Once it identifies investment opportunities, it establishes trades to isolate asymmetric return distributions. This tailored approach to investing allows Context to also construct bespoke funds or managed accounts in consultation with its clients.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Currently, the Trust is comprised of one series, the Context Alternative Strategies Fund (“Alternative Strategies Fund”).[1] 
           Each of the Trust's series will have its own investment objective, policies and restrictions.
2. Context Capital, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any future Adviser also will also be registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Context Capital serves as the investment adviser of the Alternative Strategies Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Trust (the “Advisory Agreement”).[2] 
           The Advisory Agreement was approved by the board of trustees of the Trust (the “Board”), including a majority of the members of the board of trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the Trust, the Fund, or of the Adviser (“Independent Trustees”) and was approved by the initial shareholder of the Alternative Strategies Fund, in the manner required by sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.[3] 
           Applicants are not seeking any exemptions with respect to the Advisory Agreement or Future Advisory Agreements.
3. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, and subject to the oversight of the Board, Context Capital is responsible for the overall management of the Alternative Strategies Fund's business affairs and selecting investments according to its investment objective, policies, and restrictions. For the investment management services that it provides to the Alternative Strategies Fund, Context Capital receives the fee specified in the Advisory Agreement based on average daily net assets. In addition, under the Advisory Agreement, Context Capital may retain one or more subadvisers, at Context Capital's own cost and expense, subject to approval of the Board, including approval by a majority of the Independent Trustees and the shareholders of the Fund (if required by applicable law), for the purpose of managing the investment of all or a portion of the assets of the Alternative Strategies Fund. Context Capital has entered into subadvisory agreements with eight subadvisers to provide investment advisory services to the Alternative Strategies Fund.[4] 
           Each subadviser is an “investment adviser” as defined in section 2(a)(20) of the Act and registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser selects subadvisers based on the Adviser's evaluation of the subadviser's skills in managing assets pursuant to particular investment styles that are consistent with the investment objective of each Fund and recommends their hiring to the Board. For the investment advisory services subadvisers provide to the Funds, each subadviser receives annual fees from the Adviser calculated at an annual rate based on the average daily net assets of the respective Fund. The Adviser compensates each subadviser out of the fees that are paid to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement.[5] 

4. Applicants request an order to permit the Adviser, subject to approval of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, to do the following without obtaining shareholder approval: (a) Select an unaffiliated investment subadviser or subadvisers (each a “Subadviser”) to manage all or a portion of the assets of the Alternative Strategies Fund or any other Fund pursuant to an investment subadvisory agreement with a Subadviser (each a “Subadvisory Agreement”), and (b) materially amend Subadvisory Agreements. The requested relief will not extend to any subadviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Trust, a Fund or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a subadviser to one or more of the Funds (“Affiliated Subadviser”).
5. If a new Subadviser is hired, the Fund will inform shareholders of the hiring of a new Subadviser pursuant to the following procedures (“Modified Notice and Access Procedures”): (a) Within 90 days after a new Subadviser is hired for any Fund, that Fund will send its shareholders either a Multi-manager Notice or a Multi-manager Notice and Multi-manager Information Statement; [6] 
           and (b) the Fund will make Start Printed Page 1521the Multi-manager Information Statement available on the Web site identified in the Multi-manager Notice no later than when the Multi-manager Notice (or Multi-manager Notice and Multi-manager Information Statement) is first sent to shareholders, and will maintain it on that Web site for at least 90 days. Applicants assert that a proxy solicitation to approve the appointment of new Subadvisers provides no more meaningful information to shareholders than the proposed Multi-manager Information Statement. Moreover, as indicated above, the Board would comply with the requirements of sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act before entering into or amending Subadvisory Agreements.
6. Applicants also request an order exempting the Fund from certain disclosure provisions described below that may require the Applicants to disclose fees paid to each Subadviser by the Adviser. Applicants seek an order to permit each Fund to disclose (both as a dollar amount and a percentage of a Fund's net assets): (a) Aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and Affiliated Subadvisers; and (b) aggregate fees paid to Subadvisers other than Affiliated Subadvisers (“Aggregate Fee Disclosure”). For any Fund that employs Affiliated Subadvisers, the Fund will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to such Affiliated Subadvisers.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 15(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser of a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that has been approved by the vote of a majority of the company's outstanding voting securities of such registered company. Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the Act requires shareholder approval.
2. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A requires disclosure of the method and amount of the investment adviser's compensation.
3. Rule 20a-1 under the Act requires proxies solicited with respect to a registered investment company to comply with Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”). Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A, taken together, require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser,” the “aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fees,” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon,” and, if a change in the advisory fee is proposed, the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees.
4. Regulation S-X sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of a registered investment company's registration statement and shareholder reports filed with the Commission. Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation S-X require a registered investment company to include in its financial statement information about investment advisory fees.
5. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below.
6. Applicants assert that the shareholders expect the Adviser, subject to the review and approval of the Board, to select the Subadvisers who are best suited to achieve each Fund's investment objective. Applicants assert that, from the perspective of the shareholder, the role of the Subadvisers is substantially equivalent to the role of the individual portfolio managers employed by an investment adviser to a traditional investment company. Applicants state that requiring shareholder approval of each Subadvisory Agreement would impose unnecessary delays and expenses on the Funds and may preclude the Funds from acting promptly when the Adviser and Board consider it appropriate to hire Subadvisers or amend Subadvisory Agreements. Applicants note that the Advisory Agreements and Subadvisory Agreements with Affiliated Subadvisers (if any) will remain subject to the shareholder approval requirements of section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.
7. Applicants assert that the requested disclosure relief will benefit shareholders to the extent that it will facilitate lower overall investment advisory fees. Applicants state that if the Adviser is not required to disclose the Subadvisers' fees to the public, the Adviser may be able to negotiate rates that are below a Subadviser's “posted” amounts. Applicants state that the requested relief will encourage Subadvisers to negotiate lower advisory fees with the Adviser if the lower fees are not required to be made public.
Applicants' Conditions

1. Before a Fund may rely on the requested order, the operation of the Fund in the manner described in the Application will be approved by a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities, as defined in the Act, or in the case of a Fund whose public shareholders purchase shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition 2 below, by the initial shareholder(s) before offering shares of that Fund to the public.

5. At all times, at least a majority of the Board will be Independent Trustees, and the selection and nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees will be placed within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
6. Whenever a subadviser change is proposed for a Fund with an Affiliated Subadviser, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will make a separate finding, reflected Start Printed Page 1522in the applicable Board minutes, that such change is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders, and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Adviser or the Affiliated Subadviser derives an inappropriate advantage.
7. Independent legal counsel, as defined in rule 0-1(a)(6) under the Act, will be engaged to represent the Independent Trustees. The selection of such counsel will be within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
8. The Adviser will provide the Board, no less frequently than quarterly, with information about the profitability of the Adviser on a per Fund basis. The information will reflect the impact on profitability of the hiring or termination of any Subadviser during the applicable quarter.

13. Each Fund will disclose the Aggregate Fee Disclosure in its registration statement.
