eDoorways Welcomes Escue’s New Polo PowerChannel   eDoorways and Polo Make a Match as Escue Polo LLC Introduces Its New PowerChannel  August 31, 2010 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time   AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--eDoorways (Pink Sheets: EDWY) and Escue Polo LLC are joining teams to launch the Escue Polo PowerChannel. Escue will use the new channel to augment its current website located at www.escue-polo.com.       “Our vision and dedication to the sport of polo has led us to further expand our involvement in the sport by providing a unique and sophisticated line of clothing”   “Escue is a leading force on the world polo scene,” stated Gary Kimmons, CEO of eDoorways. “Polo aficionados span the globe, and now they will be able to connect with one another in a world-class venue,” Kimmons continued.   What started over 20 years ago as a small family operation, has grown today to several worldwide locations including Monaco, France, Tunisia, Dubai, Pakistan, and Hong Kong to name a few. Like eDoorways, Escue Polo is also equally committed to environmental conservation and social responsibility.   Escue Polo represents more than just a polo team, it is a family legacy. Its inception took place over 20 years ago as a small family-run operation in Wellington, Florida. The purpose of such an operation was to create an unparalleled polo team and provide the local community with all the different services associated with polo, including horse sales and leasing, horse training, polo lessons, and polo events. Since then, Escue has grown to be one of the top polo teams in the world, winning the prestigious U.S Open in 1998 and competing as defending champions in the 2005 Argentine Open.   “Our vision and dedication to the sport of polo has led us to further expand our involvement in the sport by providing a unique and sophisticated line of clothing,” stated Shah Quraeshi, Escue Polo’s managing director. “Our apparel will not only complement any polo player’s fashion, but will also enhance the wardrobe of those who want to make a statement in the community... And now, with the Escue Polo PowerChannel, we have an opportunity to engage with our clients in a powerful new way,” Shah continued.   “Our love for this sport, along with our dedication to detail and our sense of style represent our devotion to the needs of our customers,” continued Shah. “From inception to completion of the final product, it is our goal to provide polo apparel which exceeds our customer’s expectations and truly reflects this noble sport,” Shah concluded.   Escue continues to work relentlessly to adapt their product to the most environmentally friendly standards. They are also dedicated to alleviate poverty from the world by donating a percentage of all sales to several non-profit organizations which provide medical care and emergency services to the underprivileged community.
