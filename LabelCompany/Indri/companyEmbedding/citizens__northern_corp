Relative Strength Alert For Citizens & Northern
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Citizens & Northern Corp presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Citizens & Northern Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 5.30% Yield (CZNC)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Ex-Div Reminder for Citizens & Northern (CZNC)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 4/30/15, Citizens & Northern Corp will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.26, payable on 5/15/15. As a percentage of CZNC's recent stock price of $20.66, this dividend works out to approximately 1.26%, so look for shares of Citizens & Northern Corp to trade 1.26% lower — all else being equal — when CZNC shares open for trading on 4/30/15.
