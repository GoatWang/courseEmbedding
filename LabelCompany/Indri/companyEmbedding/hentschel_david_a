Featured User: David Hentschel
Famous Record Producer Discovers MovieWorks Plus






The Challenge:

Marketing
                      and promotion are key areas for any self-employed
                      creative professional. In the music business it has been
                      traditional to provide a 'showreel' to showcase talent
                      and experience, usually in the form of an audio CD. The
                      challenge was how to stand out from the crowd by taking
                      this one step further. 

The Solution:

Legendary 
                    record producer David Hentschel, who has worked with some 
                    of the best in the business including Elton John, Paul McCartney, 
                    George Harrison, Genesis and Queen,  
                    turned to the Mac OS X version of MovieWorks Plus as his multimedia 
                    authoring tool of choice for creating a themed high-impact 
                    interactive presentation.

 Background:





While 
                          most of David's time is spent in the recording studio, 
                          he does have a parallel career in technology - primarily 
                          software design, programming and "anything 
                          to do with computers". Amongst other outlets, 
                          he used these talents to develop his own website. 
                          In his presentation project David wanted to carry through 
                          the visual theme of his website, but develop it further 
                          by incorporating extra features and content which are 
                          not suited to web delivery. An interactive DVD-ROM was 
                          the only way to go.... 



 
After
                        sketching out his ideas, and to help in deciding which
                        authoring tools he would use, David prioritized what he needed
                        to incorporate in his project.

menu-driven
					     interactive framework 
 many
				      large high quality audio and video files
graphic
					     animations 
dynamic
					     on-screen text often synchronized to music
active
					     email and weblinks
universal
				     cross-platform delivery 

The
					     final piece of the puzzle was that the whole project
					     needed to be built and ready for deployment as quickly
					     as possible. David takes up the story: 
"I looked at
					   all the other software available for authoring my project
					   and found each package wanting due to either inadequate
					   features, unnecessary complexity, unreliability, steep
					   learning curves or prohibitive cost. 'Time is money'
					   - a cliché but
					   true, and I needed to turn this project around fast.
					   After a quick web search, I came upon MovieWorks Plus.
					   Literally within minutes of downloading the demo I was
					   authoring. MovieWorks Plus is so intuitive and includes all
					   the tools I needed in one very user-friendly package.
					   All this for $49? Wow!"

 
Successful
			         Outcome:




David's 
                          presentation opens with a high speed eye-catching graphic 
                          animation, created in Flash and imported as a QuickTime 
                          movie into MovieWorks Plus.
"From the outset
                            I wanted make the DVD feel familiar to people who
                            had visited my website",
                            says David.

From
                        here you are taken to a series of menu pages or scenes,
                          each containing text buttons which link to lower level
                          menus whose text links in turn link to the content
                          pages. Every page has a 'back' button to return to
                          the previous page. 
"I
                        wanted the navigation scheme to be familiar to any
                        user, so that they can concentrate on the content
                        rather than how to find it", says David. "With
                        the scene linking capabilities  of MovieWorks Plus, this was
                        a breeze".

The 
                        first page is the Main Menu. There are links to David's 
                        biographical section 'About Me', a 'Records' section containing 
                        full length versions of songs he has worked on, a 'Movies' 
                        section containing video clips of movies he has composed 
                        for, and finally a 'More' section containing other snippets 
                        of interest. Each menu is underscored by ambient music 
                        themed throughout the project. All movies and audio segments 
                        were compressed using QuickTime 7's amazing h.264 compression. 
                        



 



This
                            first sub menu contains links to David's biographical
                            content. MovieWorks Plus provides for active weblinks,
                            so here you can see a link to his website and also
                            an email link. Each of the links in every menu appears
                            progressively, and always in time to the underlying
                            music. 



 



This
                            sub menu contains links to a short mission statement about
                            David's recording philosophy, the songs themselves,
                            an edited video of David working in the studio with
                            Elton John during the recording of "Goodbye Yellow
                            Brick Road", and finally a section containing press
                            reviews of some David's more well known albums.



 



Here
                            is an example of an artist content page. It lists
                            some of Elton John's songs which David either recorded
                            or performed on. The user clicks on the appropriate
                            blue loudspeaker to hear each song instantly in high
                            quality audio. 



 



On 
                        to movies. These are just some of the movies for which 
                        David has composed the music score. An edited video trailer 
                        of the movies runs in the center of the screen while this 
                        page is being viewed, and the links below take you to 
                        video clips and more information about each movie.



 



This
                            is the movie content page for Educating Rita. After
                            the movie text information there are links to eight
                            movie clips which each feature some of David's music. 



                    "To complement the look of my project I put a lot of 
                    emphasis on visual synchronization of the graphics and text 
                    to the music. In a sense this is an expression of what I have 
                    learned through my movie scoring - marrying audio to visual 
                    in as pleasing a way as possible. The Sequencer built in to 
                    MovieWorks Plus simplifies this greatly, allowing me to slide graphic 
                    images around to precisely match audio hits"

David
                      summarizes his experience building his project thus: 
"By 
                      far the biggest and longest job, at least for me was editing 
                      the video clips. Most video editing was done in iMovie with 
                      which I was already familiar, and the movies were exported 
                      using QuickTime 7's h.264 compression prior to importing 
                      into MovieWorks Plus. Assembling and structuring the project 
                      was a very straightforward and quick process thanks to MovieWorks Plus which I also used to create all the text based content and 
                      many of the effects. I used Photoshop for the more demanding 
                      image editing, and Flash for the more complex visual effects 
                      - it's simple to import anything into MovieWorks Plus so integrating 
                      other specialist software is never a problem. I am in no 
                      sense of the word a graphic designer or layout artist, but 
                      it was really satisfying to be able to realize my ideas 
                      so easily. Added to that is the fact that MovieWorks Plus is 
                      so ridiculously simple and intuitive to use and that saved 
                      me an enormous amount of time. Finally, when it came to 
                      publish my project, using the MovieWorks Plus Player made it 
                      really simple to ensure that both Mac and Windows users 
                      would be guaranteed an identical viewing experience without 
                      the need of anything more than the ubiquitous QuickTime."



 
The Bottom Line:
 
A
                      few months on and David tells us that he has received nothing
                      but enthusiastic reaction to his presentation DVD from
                      everyone who has viewed it. Let's hope that it brings results
                      for him! 
"Thanks 
                    guys, and just let me add that I've since found that it's 
                    very easy to add new material and update my project - because 
                    MovieWorks Plus links separate scenes to create a structure, each 
                    scene can be easily edited without affecting other parts of 
                    one long timeline, and since each scene is a mini-timeline 
                    of separate objects, these can easily be moved, changed or 
                    supplemented individually." David H.

David Hentschel


Born
18 December 1952
Sussex


Occupation(s)
Recording engineer, movie composer and music producer


Associated acts
George Harrison, Elton John, Genesis






David Hentschel at Scott Frankfurt Studio, Woodland Hills, CA


David Hentschel (born 18 December 1952) is an English recording engineer, movie composer and music producer who engineered on George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,[1] as well as with artists including Genesis, Tony Banks, Ringo Starr, Queen, Nazareth, Marti Webb, Andy Summers, Mike Oldfield, Renaissance, Peter Hammill and Ronnie Caryl.
Hentschel was born in Sussex. His career began at Trident Studios in London where he was initially an assistant before rising to become one of the in-house producers. In addition to engineering and production credits, Hentschel also played early synthesizers with a diverse range of bands including Nazareth, Pilot and Byzantium. He played synthesizer on several high profile recordings, including Elton John's "Rocket Man" and "Funeral for a Friend" from the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road [2] album. "Funeral for a Friend" featured an early analogue synthesizer, the ARP 2500, to create tonal feeling and effect.
After leaving Trident in 1974, he produced his own album Startling Music for Ringo Starr's short lived record label, Ring O'Records, consisting of a song-by-song, instrumental cover of Starr's album Ringo and featuring performances by Phil Collins, David Cole, Ronnie Caryl, John Gilbert and Starr. He then began a successful collaboration with the band Genesis which resulted in five albums beginning with A Trick of the Tail [3] in 1976.
In 1982, Hentschel collaborated with lyricist Don Black on a song cycle album for Marti Webb to follow her success with Tell Me on a Sunday. I'm Not That Kind of Girl was released in 1983. Despite including the talent of Phil Collins on drums and Kiki Dee on backing vocals, it failed to chart and was Webb's last album for Polydor.
In 1988 Hentschel produced and engineered the Grammy Award winning album Politics, by the jazz fusion band Yellowjackets.[4]
Hentschel also wrote the scores for the films Operation Daybreak (1975), Seven Nights in Japan (1976), The Squeeze (1977) and Educating Rita (1983).[5]
Relocating to Los Angeles in 1985, he established one of the first dedicated MIDI studios and worked with Ensoniq on developing instruments and custom sounds. Now living back in England he continues to produce, compose and arrange on both sides of the Atlantic.
Hentschel has recently worked as an engineer, musician, producer and arranger for a number of Contemporary Christian music artists including Out of Eden, Jennifer Knapp, Point of Grace and P.O.D.. In 2012, Hentschel produced prog/harp band Art in America.[6] He is also heavily involved in developing new artists.

Discography[edit]
