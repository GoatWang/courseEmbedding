	Shaving Tips for Men| How to Shave
































 Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube 























 













STEP 1:  WASH IT
How:
Start by washing your face with soap and warm water. Feels good, right?
Why:
Water allows your whiskers to soften. The soap removes oils from your hair and skin, but it’s NOT a shaving gel substitute, pal.







STEP 2:  APPLY IT
How:
Apply a layer of gel to face and let sit for three minutes. What you do with your free time is up to you, big guy.
Why:
Gel provides extra moisturizers to soften skin, reduce friction and carry away debris removed by the razor blade. It can also make you look kinda badass.







STEP 3:  SHAVE IT
How:
Most guys say to shave in the direction your hair grows. But, if you’re not a super-sensitive lad, you’ll get a closer shave going against the grain. Ladies dig the smooth.
Why:
With sensitive skin you’ll avoid irritation if you follow most guys’ advice. Either way, go slow and avoid rapid strokes. The only things speed gets you here is a date with tissue pieces.







STEP 4:  RINSE IT
How:
Immediately after shaving, splash your face with cold water to remove all traces of lather. Look at you now, champ!
Why:
The cold water closes your facial pores, plus no one wants to walk around with shave gel on their face. Be sure to check those earlobes, too.







STEP 5:  REST IT
How:
Rest your skin for 30 minutes before applying any kind of lotion or medications, or before going swimming…really.
Why:
Skin is most sensitive after shaving, so waiting will prevent inflammation or irritation. Plus, chlorine or salt water may sting if you rush in for a dip.







FINAL STEP:  THUMBS UP!
How:
NICE JOB, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GET YOUR EDGE?

1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Air Products’ second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales rose by double-digits year over year, and beat expectations. Air Products has a strong project backlog and benefits from cost-reduction measures and a diverse customer base. Moreover, acquisitions, strategic investments and new business deals are expected to continue to support results in fiscal 2017. However, the company’s industrial gases business in the EMEA region is seeing pressure from a weak operating environment. The company is also seeing lower volumes in Latin America due to weak demand. Moreover, volumes in packaged gases continue to be weak while LNG sales remain under pressure due to low project activity. The company is also exposed to currency headwinds." (5/1/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "KMI will hold an Analyst Conference in Houston on Jan. 25th to review operations, discuss strategic initiatives, and profile financial guidance. We expect mgmt to detail 2017 financial projections, expanding upon preliminary estimates it offered in December. Moreover, we anticipate significant discussion of its $12B project backlog and efforts to potentially partner on certain assets and/or otherwise work to minimize risk while extracting value. 2017 guidance. On Dec. 5th, KMI initiated 2017 adjusted EBITDA & DCF guidance of ~ $7.2B and ~$4.46B, respectively, and noted plans to deploy ~$3.2B on growth initiatives with anticipated YE leverage of ~5.4x (debt/EBITDA). As is its historic custom, we expect mgmt to greatly expand upon this preliminary outlook at its Analyst Conference and anticipate segment-specific forecasts will be forthcoming. As KMI remains focused on achieving leverage targets consistent with a return to dividend growth, we believe investors will explore mgmt’s expectations for big-ticket projects, legacy asset declines, and ongoing JV initiatives."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 4 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $152.92 (5.00% upside)

	Shaving Tips for Men| How to Shave
































 Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube 























 













STEP 1:  WASH IT
How:
Start by washing your face with soap and warm water. Feels good, right?
Why:
Water allows your whiskers to soften. The soap removes oils from your hair and skin, but it’s NOT a shaving gel substitute, pal.







STEP 2:  APPLY IT
How:
Apply a layer of gel to face and let sit for three minutes. What you do with your free time is up to you, big guy.
Why:
Gel provides extra moisturizers to soften skin, reduce friction and carry away debris removed by the razor blade. It can also make you look kinda badass.







STEP 3:  SHAVE IT
How:
Most guys say to shave in the direction your hair grows. But, if you’re not a super-sensitive lad, you’ll get a closer shave going against the grain. Ladies dig the smooth.
Why:
With sensitive skin you’ll avoid irritation if you follow most guys’ advice. Either way, go slow and avoid rapid strokes. The only things speed gets you here is a date with tissue pieces.







STEP 4:  RINSE IT
How:
Immediately after shaving, splash your face with cold water to remove all traces of lather. Look at you now, champ!
Why:
The cold water closes your facial pores, plus no one wants to walk around with shave gel on their face. Be sure to check those earlobes, too.







STEP 5:  REST IT
How:
Rest your skin for 30 minutes before applying any kind of lotion or medications, or before going swimming…really.
Why:
Skin is most sensitive after shaving, so waiting will prevent inflammation or irritation. Plus, chlorine or salt water may sting if you rush in for a dip.







FINAL STEP:  THUMBS UP!
How:
NICE JOB, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GET YOUR EDGE?
