      Sidelights
    

      Gregg L. Engles serves as chief executive officer and board chair of Dean
      Foods, the number-one processor and distributor of milk and milk products
      in the United States. Little known outside of the dairy world, Engles
      almost single-handedly consolidated that industry in the 1990s as he
      bought and merged dozens of small regional producers. He credits his
      law-school background as one of the keys to his success in negotiating
      deals. "I never wanted to be a lawyer," he told Cathy Sivak,
      a writer for 
      
        Dairy Field
      
      , "but I thought it was good general training for the business
      world."
    

      Born in 1957 in Durant, Oklahoma, Engles came from a family with an ardent
      devotion to educational pursuits. His father, a doctor, was one of four
      physicians among his five brothers; their mother had once been a teacher,
      and in her later years ran an informal preschool for her grandchildren out
      of her home. "She was totally committed to the notion that
      education would be what would separate people in the future in terms of
      personal success," Engles recalled in the interview with Sivak for 
      
        Dairy Field
      
      .
    

      Engles moved to the Denver, Colorado, area with his family when he was
      eight years old, and earned his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth
      College in New Hampshire. He went on to Yale University School of Law, and
      served a clerkship—an internship of sorts for law school students
      or new graduates—with Anthony Kennedy, a judge with the United
      States Court of Appeals' Ninth Circuit in San Francisco; Kennedy
      would later be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Engles, however, was
      unsure about his own long-term prospects in the field: He took and passed
      the bar exams for Colorado and Texas, and practiced briefly, but realized
      that most of the young attorneys a few years his senior did not seem to
      derive much satisfaction from their jobs. The entrepreneurs he came to
      know, by contrast, were enthusiastic and energized by their careers.
    

      Engles took a job in the office of a Dallas investor in order to gain some
      practical experience. His first idea for a business venture involved a
      scheme to sell time-shares for corporate aircraft, but he was unable to
      convince enough potential investors. The 
      plan proved slightly ahead of its time, for similar ventures in the late
      1990s catering to the executive class in need of access to a private jet
      became extremely popular. In 1985, Engles joined with a business partner
      and began to make investments in Texas real estate. A few years later, the
      local market fell into a slump and Engles lost a great deal of money. But
      he and the business partner had better luck with their next scheme: They
      borrowed nearly all of the $26 million purchase price for a packaged-ice
      company in Texas that was the original product for the company that became
      the Southland Corporation, owners and franchisers of 7-11 stores.
      Southland was heavily in debt at the time and forced to sell off a few
      subsidiaries, including Reddy Ice.
    

      After acquiring Reddy Ice in 1988, Engles began buying other small
      regional ice companies and folding them into the business. Within a few
      years Reddy Ice became the largest packaged-ice company in the United
      States. A business mentor who had worked in the dairy industry for many
      years then suggested that the milk business might be a good candidate for
      the same type of consolidation. Both products needed reliable refrigerated
      transportation, and had been dominated by local companies for decades.
      Moreover, the U.S. supermarket industry was undergoing a wave of
      consolidation, and the larger companies that were coming to dominate the
      market were interested in dealing with one major dairy supplier, instead
      of several small regional ones.
    

      Engles followed the advice and bought Suiza Dairy of San Juan, Puerto
      Rico, in 1993, soon merging it with Reddy Ice and folding a newly acquired
      Florida dairy, Velda Farms, into the operations as well. Over the next few
      years, Engles began buying more dairies and consolidating operations until
      the newly renamed Suiza Foods Corporation became a publicly traded company
      in 1996. It reached the $1 billion sales mark a year later, and Engles
      decided to sell off the ice business to concentrate solely on the dairy
      market.
    

      Between 1996 and 2000, Suiza bought 40 more dairy producers in deals that
      Engles negotiated personally. Then, in December of 2001 he bought Dean
      Foods, and merged it with Suiza in a $2.5 billion deal. The Chicago-based
      Dean Foods was the only other dairy company besides Suiza that had a
      national presence, and Engles decided to keep the Dean brand name for the
      newly merged company, which cornered almost one-third of the U.S. milk
      market. It also posts strong sales in the milk-alternative market with its
      Silk soy milk and Lactaid lactose-reduced milk products, and makes a raft
      of other grocery-store items as well, such as Horizon organic dairy
      products, International Delight coffee creamers, and Morningstar Foods
      frozen products.
    

      Married with one child, Engles presides over a Dallas-based company with
      27,000 employees and 2005 revenues of $2.57 billion. Often, the dairies
      that came under the Suiza or Dean Foods umbrella were family-run
      businesses, but "many of the next generation wanted to go off and
      do new things," Engles explained to 
      
        Rocky Mountain News
      
       journalist Janet Forgrieve. "It turned into a great thing all
      around." He also felt that he was involved in a business with a
      legacy of strong intergenerational values not unlike the ones with which
      he was raised. When Sivak, the 
      
        Dairy Field
      
       writer, asked him what the favorite part of his job was, he replied that
      it was "the wholesomeness of it, and I don't mean just the
      product. The industry is just chock full of really nice people with
      outstanding personal and professional values." He did admit,
      however, that the same factor also presented the most challenging part of
      his job. Noting that dairy farmers regularly get up long before dawn to
      start the day's milking, Engles told Sivak that "I hate the
      feeling that I spend between 8:30 to 11 a.m. catching up with people who
      have already finished their day."

      Texas 75201; http://www.deanfoods.com.
    

      ■ Gregg Engles presided over a consolidation of the dairy industry,
      first as head of Suiza Foods Corporation and then as chairman and chief
      executive officer of Dean Foods Company. Dean Foods Company became the
      largest processor and distributor of milk in the United States.
    

      EARLY YEARS IN COLORADO
    

      Although born in Oklahoma, Gregg Engles grew up in the Denver, Colorado,
      area. He attended Dartmouth College and studied law at Yale University.
      After graduation in 1982 Engles worked as a law clerk for Judge Anthony
      Kennedy, who at the time was serving on the United States Court of
      Appeals, Ninth Circuit, and later became an associate justice of the
      United States Supreme Court. In 1983 while a clerk, Engles attempted to
      form a time-share business for corporate aircraft but was unable to raise
      funds. Engles was ahead of his time, because jet time-shares later became
      a huge business.
    

      Engles was admitted to the Colorado state bar in 1982 and to the state bar
      of Texas in 1984, but he decided not to practice law. While pursuing his
      unsuccessful aircraft time-share venture, Engles had met
      "entrepreneurs who impressed him as being fully engaged in their
      work. In contrast, many of the young lawyers seemed unenthusiastic about
      their jobs, even though they were buying new cars and homes. Engles
      decided that his biggest personal risk was getting hooked on a lifestyle
      that would handcuff him to a job," according to June Eichbaum and
      Victoria Reese of 
      
        Chief Legal Officer
      
       (2002).
    

      PURSUES ENTREPRENEURIAL CAREER
    

      Engles went to work for an investor in Dallas, Texas, who made investments
      in private companies. Through the business he met a partner, Bob Kaminski,
      and began investing in real estate in 1985. Again Engles's timing
      was off. The Texas real estate market was poised for a major downturn. The
      ventures went so poorly that Engles and his partner were almost bankrupt.
      In 1988 the Southland Corporation, which later became 7-Eleven, had
      excessive debt because of a management buyout and needed to raise cash.
      Engles and Kaminski paid $26 million, almost entirely borrowed, for the
      Southland subsidiary Reddy Ice Group, a producer of packaged ice.
    

      Using Reddy Ice, Engles and his partners began acquiring other ice
      companies and consolidating the local ice industry. Gayle Beshears, who
      had led the ice operations for 7-Eleven, advised Engles. By 1990 Reddy Ice
      had acquired 15 ice plants. Beshears's brother, Cletes
      "Tex" Beshears, was a semiretired veteran of the dairy
      industry. He suggested that the larger dairy industry could be
      consolidated as Reddy Ice had consolidated the ice business.
    

      ACQUIRES SUIZA DAIRY
    

      In 1993 Engles and his partners acquired Suiza Dairy in San Juan, Puerto
      Rico, as the first step in their dairy consolidation plan. Engles's
      strategy was to buy the leading producer in
       a region, acquire other nearby producers, and then consolidate operations
      to capitalize on the economies of scale and increase profit. In the dairy
      industry Engles's timing was right. Engles had an advantage in the
      consolidation of the dairy industry because his customers in the grocery
      industry were going through a similar consolidation. The large grocery
      companies wanted to reduce the number of vendors and preferred dealing
      with a large dairy that had a national presence. In addition, changes in
      processing and transportation technologies increased the shelf life of
      dairy products, and processors became able to ship greater distances.
    

      In 1994 Engles Management Corporation bought Velda Farms, another dairy,
      and in 1995 Engles merged Reddy Ice into the dairy acquisitions to form
      Suiza Foods Corporation. In 1996 Suiza Foods Corporation went public,
      providing additional capital for growth and spurring further acquisitions.
      Suiza Foods reached sales of $1 billion in 1997. Suiza Foods sold Reddy
      Ice in 1998 to focus on the dairy operations. Suiza Foods made more than
      40 more acquisitions from its initial public offering through 2000, when
      Suiza Foods became the nation's largest dairy processor and
      distributor. That year Suiza Foods was named dairy supplier of the year by
      Wal-Mart because of a large sales increase, a 99.5 percent on-time
      delivery record, and innovative marketing programs.
    

      At the acquired companies Engles attempted to preserve the entrepreneurial
      spirit of the local management and made bonuses dependent on performance.
      Joining Suiza Foods was an attractive option for many local and
      family-held businesses. The family and employees could continue in the
      dairy business yet have greater access to capital, new technologies, and
      branded products.
    

      SUIZA FOODS CORPORATION BECOMES DEAN FOODS COMPANY
    

      In December 2001 Suiza Foods Corporation acquired Dean Foods Company, and
      Suiza Foods Corporation changed its name to Dean Foods Company. After the
      Dean Foods acquisition, the new company had a 30 percent share of the milk
      market. Engles became chairman when Howard Dean retired in April 2002.
    

      Dean Foods Company sold dairy products under more than 50 different
      brands, including Country Fresh, Medal Gold, Alta Dena, and Garelick
      Farms, and was the only milk company that could serve as a sole supplier
      to national retailers. The company also encompassed Silk soy milk, Horizon
      organic dairy products and juices, International Delight coffee creamers,
      and Marie's dips and dressings. The company licensed the brands
      Hershey's, Land O Lakes, and Folgers for use on its milks and
      milkshakes, creamers, and milk and coffee beverages. Dean Foods Company
      was also one of the nation's largest pickle processors.
    

      Engles's transformation of the dairy industry was "analogous
      to what Herb Kelleher's Southwest Airlines accomplished in air
      transportation and what Sam Walton's Wal-Mart did in retailing. The
      dairy business will never be the same," wrote Shad Rowe of 
      
        D—Dallas/Ft. Worth
      
      . William Heuslein, writing for 
      
        Forbes
      
      , quoted food analyst William Leach describing Engles as a visionary.
    

      After the acquisition of Dean Foods Company, Engles and the company
      entered a new phase. Much of the plan for consolidation of the dairy
      industry through acquisitions had been completed. Dean Foods
      Company's strategy turned toward increasing branded products and
      producing higher margins.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      In addition to his full-time role at Dean Foods Company, Engles remained a
      partner in Engles, Urso, Follmer Capital, formed in 1995. Engles served as
      a director of one of the group's portfolio companies, Evercom,
      which provided pay phones in prisons. In 1998 Engles, Urso, Follmer
      Capital purchased the vacuum cleaner company Electrolux, and Engles served
      as a director of that private company.
    

      Engles continued to seize opportunities despite poor timing and missteps
      in his early endeavors. He told Eichbaum and Reese, "Many lawyers
      let knowledge of risk paralyze them. They focus exclusively on risk, while
      entrepreneurs focus primarily on opportunity. The person who can
      simultaneously perceive the opportunity and the risk has a competitive
      advantage." Rowe described Engles's career path as follows:
      "A smart, capable person becomes consumed by a business opportunity
      so big that both the business and the individual grow to levels
      unimaginable once even to him." Rowe also noted, "People who
      meet Engles frequently describe him as 'scary
      smart'." Engles himself saw his strengths as doing deals and
      attracting well-qualified people.
    

      Engles served on the boards of directors of a number of charitable and
      industry organizations, include the Grocery Manufacturers of America,
      Southern Methodist University, and Students in Free Enterprise. He was a
      trustee of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the Southwestern
      Medical Foundation. He served on the School of Business Administration
      Advisory Council for the University of Texas at Arlington.
