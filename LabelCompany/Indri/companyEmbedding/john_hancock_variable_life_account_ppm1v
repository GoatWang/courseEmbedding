Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

Variable universal life insurance products are long-term contracts and are sold by prospectus. They are subject to market risk due to the underlying sub-accounts, and are unsuitable as a short term savings vehicle.

 Provides Life Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Retirement Income

 for Key Executives at Minimal Net Cost to Sponsoring Business

 BOSTON, April 4 /PRNewswire/ --

 John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned
subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE: JHF), has
added Medallion Executive Variable Life III (MEVL III) to its suite of
COLI products. This new corporate owned/sponsored life insurance
product is designed to meet the sophisticated needs of the highly
specialized executive benefits market.

 MEVL III is a highly flexible, variable universal life insurance policy intended specifically for funding multi-life executive benefit
plans, which can provide another tax-deferred option for executives.
When properly funded, the plans generally offer valuable life insurance
benefits for selected executives at retirement, as well as supplemental
retirement income at minimal net cost to the sponsoring business.

 MEVL III includes key features for corporate clients.

 -- When maximum funded, MEVL III offers over 100 percent first-year
cash

 values, which results in no charge to earnings

 -- It has a preferred underwriting category, as well as extremely

 competitive guaranteed issue rates

 -- It provides strong early, as well as long-term, cash value
growth when

 compared to other leading corporate-owned life insurance products

 -- Strong long-term cash value performance leads to higher death
benefit

 for cost recovery at death (strong internal rate of return at age
80)

 -- The product also provides the option to use an enhanced cash
value

 rider to attain even higher early surrender values.

 With MEVL III, a business can offer executives the option of
deferring a percentage of their salary above the maximum allowed under
401(k) plans. A minimum of three persons must be covered, with a total
face amount of $1 million. Guaranteed issue is available beginning at
10 lives assuming 100 percent participation. It also is available for
single life cases with $25,000 of annual premium.

 MEVL III offers a wide variety of retail and institutional
investment options managed by some of the nation's leading money
managers, as well as asset allocation tools and strong ongoing fund
oversight. The product complements MEVL, which performs better for
medium-funded business cases.

 "We believe we've hit the mark by building a state-of-the
art COLI product with the features that businesses demand. We expect to
attract a lot of new COLI business," says Karl Reinhold, general
director, estate and business planning.

 John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. and its affiliated companies
provide a broad array of insurance and investment products and services
to retail and institutional customers. As of December 31, 1999, John
Hancock and its subsidiaries had total assets under management of $127.3
billion.

 This product is not available in all states.

 Variable life insurance is sold by a prospectus. Please request a
prospectus, which contains more complete information, including charges
and expenses, and read it carefully before investing or sending money.

 Insurance products are underwritten by John Hancock Life Insurance
Company and John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company (not licensed
in New York). Securities are offered through Signator Investors, Inc.,
Member NASD, SIPC, Boston, MA 02117.

The assets maintained in the Separate Accounts will not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any other business conducted by John Hancock or JHVLICO. Nevertheless, all of the obligations of each of those companies arising under the Contracts, including its commitment to make cash value payments, annuity payments or death benefit payments, are general corporate obligations of that company. Accordingly, all of the assets of John Hancock or JHVLICO, as the case may be, are available to meet its obligations under its Contracts. 
17. Each Separate Account meets the definition of “separate account” contained in section 37 of the Act. 
18.

Each of the Contracts has at least 32 different Subaccounts that, together with their corresponding Funds (including the applicable Replaced Funds), are currently available for this purpose. 
19. Each Contract permits its owner to transfer the Contract's accumulated value from one Subaccount to another Subaccount of the issuing Separate Account at any time, subject to certain potential restrictions and charges described below. No sales charge applies to such a transfer of accumulated value among Subaccounts. 
20. The only other charges on such transfers are, under certain Contracts, flat dollar amounts that may be assessed to help defray the administrative costs of effecting the transfers. In some cases, the Contracts permit up to a specified number of free transfers in a Contract year, before any such transfer charge may be imposed. Also, under certain Contracts, no transfer is permitted if it would result in the Contract being invested in more than 18 investment options over the life of the Contract (“Lifetime Cap”) or, after the annuity payment commencement date, in more than four investment options at any one time. 
21. John Hancock or JHVLICO, as applicable, has reserved the right to make certain changes, including to substitute, for the shares held in any Subaccount, the shares of another Fund or the shares of another underlying mutual fund, as stated in each prospectus for the Contracts contained in its applicable registration statement under the 1933 Act. 
The Funds 
22. The Templeton Foreign Fund and the Templeton Developing Fund are separate Portfolios of the Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust (the “Templeton Trust”). The Templeton Trust is registered as a management investment company under the Act (File No. 811-5583), and the shares in each of its portfolios (including the Templeton Foreign Fund and the Templeton Developing Fund) are also registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 33-23493). 
23. Both the Templeton Foreign Fund and the Templeton Developing Fund issue more than one “class” of shares, which differ only as to charges they impose for sales and administrative services. In each case, the Contracts use only the “Class 2” shares, which impose an asset-based sales charge pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act (“Rule 12b-1 fee”) equal to .25% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets. Apart from the investment management fees and other Fund operating expenses, which also affect the net asset values of their shares, these Funds impose no other charges or deductions on their shares. 
24. The AIM V.I. Growth Fund and the AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund are separate portfolios of the AIM Variable Insurance Funds (“AIM V.I. Funds”). The AIM Variable Insurance Funds is registered as a management investment company under the Act (File Nos. 811-07452), and the shares in each of its Portfolios (including the AIM V.I. Growth Fund and AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund) are also registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 33-57340). 
25. Each of the AIM V.I. Growth Fund and the AIM Premier Equity Fund issues more than one “class” of shares, which differ only as to charges that they impose for sales and administrative services. In each case, the Contracts use only the “Series I” shares of the AIM V.I. Growth Fund and the AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund, which do not impose any Rule 12b-1 fees or any other fees or charges, other than investment management fees and other operating expenses that affect the net asset value of their shares. 
26. The Hancock International Fund and the Hancock International Opportunities Fund are portfolios of the John Hancock Variable Series Trust I (the “Hancock Trust”). The Hancock Trust is registered as a management investment company under the Act (File No. 811-04990), and the shares in each of its portfolios (including the Hancock International Fund and the Hancock International Opportunities Fund) are also registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 33-2081). 
27. Both the Hancock International Fund and the Hancock International Opportunities Fund offer only one class of shares, and that class does not impose any Rule 12b-1 fee or any other fees or charges, other than investment management fees and other operating expenses that affect the net asset value of their shares. 
The Funds' Investment Program 
28. The Templeton Foreign Fund is managed by Templeton Investment Counsel, LLC, which has no affiliation with John Hancock.
29. The investment objective of the Templeton Foreign Fund is long-term capital growth. The Fund is an international fund that seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in equity securities of large to medium size companies outside the U.S. The Fund's current policy is, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of its assets in non-U.S. companies. The Fund's investment philosophy is “bottom-up,” long-term, and value oriented. 
30. The Hancock International Fund is managed by John Hancock and sub-advised by Independence Investment LLC, which is indirectly wholly-owned by John Hancock. The investment objective of the Hancock International Fund is to track the performance of a broad-based equity index of foreign companies in developed and emerging markets. This Portfolio follows a “passive” investment strategy of owning a representative number of stocks in the index it seeks to track. The Fund is normally fully invested at all times. 
31. The index used by the Hancock International Fund is a composite that is weighted 90% to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) Europe, Australia and Far East (“EAFE”) Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) Index. The MSCI EAFE GDP Index is an index of non-U.S. equities in developed countries, within which each country's representation is weighted in proportion to its gross-domestic product, while companies within each country are weighted by market capitalization. The remaining 10% of the composite consists of the MSCI Emerging Markets Free (“EMF”) Index. The MSCI EMF Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of emerging market stocks. 
32. The Templeton Developing Fund is managed by Templeton Asset Management Ltd., which has no affiliation with John Hancock. The investment objective of the Templeton Developing Fund is long-term capital Start Printed Page 18311appreciation. The Fund seeks to attain this objective by investing primarily in stocks of “emerging markets” companies, and, under normal circumstances, it invests at least 80% of its assets in such companies. The Fund's investment philosophy is “bottom-up,” value oriented, and long-term. 
33. The Hancock International Opportunities Fund is managed by John Hancock and is sub-advised by T. Rowe Price International, Inc. The investment objective of this Fund is long-term capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing primarily in the stocks of large established and medium sized companies located outside the U.S., primarily in developed countries and, to a lesser extent, in emerging markets. The Fund's investment philosophy entails fundamental research on individual companies, combined with stock selection of companies with certain growth characteristics. In addition, the Hancock International Opportunities Fund broadly diversifies, whereas the Templeton Developing Fund may, at times, have significant investments in one or more countries and or sectors. 
34. The AIM V.I. Growth Fund is managed by AIM Advisors, Inc., which has no affiliation with John Hancock. The investment objective of the AIM V.I. Growth Fund is capital growth. The Fund seeks to meet its objective by investing principally in seasoned and better capitalized companies considered to have strong earnings momentum. The portfolio managers focus on companies that have experienced above-average growth in earnings and have excellent prospects for future growth. 
35. The AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund also is managed by AIM Advisors, Inc. The investment objective of the AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund is long-term capital growth. Income is a secondary investment objective. The Fund seeks to meet its objective by investing, normally, at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities, including convertible securities. The portfolio managers focus on undervalued equity securities.

42. The overall performance record of the AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund has been superior to that of the AIM V.I. Growth Fund. 
Terms of Substitutions 
43. Each Substitution will take place at the applicable Funds' relative per share net asset values determined on the date of the Substitution in accordance with section 22 of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder. Each Substitution will be effected by having each Subaccount that invests in a Replaced Fund redeem its shares of the Replaced Fund at the net asset value calculated on the date of the Substitution and purchase shares of the appropriate Replacing Fund at the net asset value calculated on the same date. 
44. John Hancock and JHVLICO will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including all legal, accounting, and brokerage expenses relating to the Substitutions, the below-described disclosure documents, and this application. No costs will be borne directly or indirectly by Contract owners. 
45. Affected Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions, and the Substitutions will result in no change in their accumulated values under their Contracts. Nor will the rights or the obligations of John Hancock or JHVLICO under the Contracts, or the insurance benefits to Contract owners, be altered in any way. The Substitutions will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the Substitutions than before the Substitutions. Start Printed Page 18312

46. The Substitutions requested in this application will be described in supplements to the applicable prospectuses for the Contracts filed with the Commission or in other supplemental disclosure documents, (collectively, “Supplements”) and mailed to all affected Contract owners. Each Supplement will give the relevant Contract owners notice of each Substitution that would affect their respective Contracts and will describe the reasons for engaging in that Substitution. The Supplements will also inform existing Contract owners with values allocated to a Subaccount investing in a Replaced Fund that no additional amounts may be allocated to the Subaccounts that invest in that Fund on or after the date of Substitution. 
47. In addition, the affected Contract owners will have (and the Supplements will inform them that they have) an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value: 

Prior to a Substitution, from the Subaccount investing in the Replaced Fund in that Substitution, or 
For 30 days after a Substitution, from a Subaccount investing in the Replacing Fund in that Substitution 

to one or more Subaccounts investing in other Funds available under the applicable Contract without the reallocation resulting in any transfer charge or limitation, counting toward the Lifetime Cap, or diminishing the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Contract year. 
48. Each affected Contract owner will also be provided with a prospectus for each relevant Replacing Fund, which will accompany or precede the Supplement discussed above. 
49. Within five days after a Substitution, John Hancock and JHVLICO each will send to its affected Contract owners written confirmation that the Substitutions have occurred. The confirmations will also identify the shares of the Replaced Portfolios that have been eliminated and the shares of the Replacing Portfolios that have been substituted. That confirmation will reiterate the free transfer rights disclosed in the Supplements that such owners will have previously received.
50. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. According to Applicants, the legislative history makes it clear that the purpose of section 26(c) is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer. Applicants state that section 26(c) does this by preventing unscrutinized substitutions, which might, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the replacing security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring either a loss of any sales load deducted from their original investment, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption proceeds, or both. 
2. Applicants submit that all of the Substitutions will benefit Contract owners by moving them to Funds with lower overall expenses and equal or better performance record and prospects. 
3. Applicants also contend that the investment characteristics of each Replacing Fund are very similar to those of the corresponding Replaced Fund. In this connection, Applicants point out that the Hancock International Opportunities Fund is somewhat more conservative than the Templeton Developing Fund, and that the AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund is somewhat more conservative than the AIM V.I. Growth Fund. However, Applicants assert that the Hancock International Fund should not be considered to be either more or less conservative than the Templeton Foreign Fund. 
4. Applicants assert that the Substitutions will be effected in a manner that has no adverse economic consequences for Contract owners. In this regard, Applicants will afford affected Contract owners protection against increased expenses and changes, under terms described in Applicants' Condition 1, below. 
5. Applicants note that Contract owners who do not wish to participate in a Replacing Fund will have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value among other available Subaccounts without the imposition of any charge or limitation. 
6. The Substitution from AIM V.I. Growth Fund is to the much larger AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund, which, according to Applicants, has potential advantages to Contract owners in terms of economies of scale and diversification of portfolio investments. Applicants acknowledge that The Templeton Developing Fund is larger than the Hancock International Opportunities Fund and that the Templeton Foreign Fund is larger than the Hancock International Fund, which would replace it. Nevertheless, Applicants point out that, even without any reimbursement arrangement, the expense ratio of each Replaced Fund is higher than that of the corresponding Replacing Fund. 
7. To summarize, Applicants submit (a) that the Substitutions will benefit the affected Contract owners and will not entail any of the abuses against which section 26(c) is addressed, and (b) that the approvals Applicants request under section 26(c) are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
Applicants' Conditions 
As conditions to the approvals that Applicants seek, 
1. For each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the 24 months following the date of Substitution into the Hancock International Fund and the Hancock International Opportunities Fund, each of John Hancock and JHVLICO will adjust the Contract values invested in either of such Funds as a result of the Substitutions, to the extent necessary to effectively reimburse the affected owners for their proportionate share of any amount by which the annual rate of the Replacing Fund's total operating expenses (after any expense waivers or reimbursements) for that fiscal period, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, plus the annual rate of any asset-based charges (excluding any such charges that are for premium taxes) deducted under the terms of the owner's Contract for that fiscal period, exceed the sum of: 

The annualized rate of the corresponding Replaced Fund's total operating expenses, as a percentage of such replaced Fund's average daily net assets, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002; plus 
The annual rate of any asset-based charges (excluding any such charges that are for premium taxes) deducted under that Contract for such twelve months. 

2. For a period of three years following the date of the Substitution of the AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund for the AIM V.I. Growth Fund, neither John Hancock nor JHVLICO will receive any direct or indirect benefits from AIM V.I.
