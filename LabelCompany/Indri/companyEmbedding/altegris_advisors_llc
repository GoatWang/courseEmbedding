PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY INVESTMENT WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, GENERATE PROFITS OR AVOID LOSSES.
        


Hedge funds, commodity pools and other alternative investments involve a high degree of risk and can be illiquid due to restrictions on transfer and lack of a secondary trading market.  They can be highly leveraged, speculative and volatile, and an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of an investment.  Alternative investments may lack transparency as to share price, valuation and portfolio holdings.  Complex tax structures often result in delayed tax reporting.  Compared to mutual funds, hedge funds and commodity pools are subject to less regulation and often charge higher fees.  Mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal.  Alternative investment managers typically exercise broad investment discretion and may apply similar strategies across multiple investment vehicles, resulting in less diversification.  Trading may occur outside the United States which may pose greater risks than trading on U.S. exchanges and in U.S. markets. 
The Altegris group of affiliated companies is wholly-owned and controlled by (i) private equity  funds managed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates (“Aquiline”), and by Genstar  Capital Management, LLC and its affiliates (“Genstar”), and (ii) certain senior management of  Altegris and other affiliates. Established in 2005, Aquiline focuses its investments exclusively in  the financial services industry. Established in 1988, Genstar focuses its investment efforts across a variety of industries and sectors,  including financial services. The Altegris companies include Altegris Investments, Altegris  Advisors, and Altegris Clearing Solutions. As of March 31, 2017, Altegris and its affiliates have approximately $2.43 billion in client assets.

Global Macro

















































Greater Volatility in Markets Ahead?
What Investors Should [Can] DoMany of you are familiar with my partners at Altegris, provider of premier alternative investments, and the recent addition of Jack L. Rivkin as the new Chief Investment Officer. Since joining Altegris in December, Jack has been busy diligently offering commentary about global economic and political events, trends, investing and alternative investments. His thoughts are heavily weighted in the investment community and I have had many fascinating conversations regarding the global market environment and his outlook for the short and long term. I highly encourage you to read this article.
There is no guarantee that any investment product will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.  Equity securities are subject to the risk of decline due to adverse news or general economic decline. International stocks are often more risky than domestic stocks due to adverse economic, social and political factors; commodities are affected by adverse weather, geopolitical, and regulatory conditions; global macro strategies are subject to foreign investment risks, market risk, and volatility due to speculative trading and use of leverage.

Altegris Advisors L.L.C. is an SEC-registered investment adviser that advises alternative strategy mutual funds that may pursue investment returns through a combination of managed futures, equities, fixed income and/or other investment strategies.

Enhancements To The Altegris Managed Futures Strategy Fund

LA JOLLA, Calif., May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Altegris Advisors, a provider of premiere alternative investments, is announcing enhancements to the Altegris Managed Futures Strategy Fund (Tickers: MFTAX, MFTIX, MFTCX, MFTOX) in an effort to provide current and future investors with increased transparency, lower costs, improved tax efficiency and the potential for greater diversification.  Altegris has transitioned the Fund to an allocation model with investment strategies pursued via direct allocation to managers.








The Fund is an actively-managed mutual fund that invests in financial and commodity futures markets, seeks to achieve positive absolute returns in rising and falling equity markets, and has the potential to dampen portfolio volatility.  Altegris Advisors now allocates Fund assets using a simpler and more streamlined process by which multiple managers trade directly for the Fund via sub-advisory and trading advisory arrangements.  The transition has no impact on Fund management fees, which are unchanged, but are expected to reduce Fund operating expenses and remove imbedded costs and fees associated with the previous allocation method.  As a result, Altegris has engaged seven new managers to pursue strategies on behalf of the Fund, including Millburn Ridgefield Corporation, QMS Capital Management, GSA Capital Partners, Crabel Capital Management, Phase Capital, Three Rock Capital Management, and Centurion Investment Management. 
"As a pioneer in managed futures delivering diversifying strategies to institutional and retail audiences for over fifteen years, we recognize that transparency, low cost, and improved tax efficiency are of the utmost importance to investors," said Matt Osborne, CIO at Altegris and Portfolio Manager of the Altegris Managed Futures Strategy Fund. "As a result of these enhancements, we're pleased to offer one of the most competitively-priced multi-manager managed futures funds in the category, and are confident that this new structure will appeal to an even wider set of investors seeking absolute returns and access to a unique blend of what we believe are leading investment managers."
This change is the firm's latest push to deliver best-in-class investment solutions across the managed futures space. In March, the firm announced the launch of the Altegris GSA Trend Strategy Fund (Tickers: TRNAX, TRNIX, TRNNX), a pure trend-following strategy with a leading quantitative manager, designed to offer investors the potential to improve the risk return profile of a traditional portfolio at a lower cost per unit of target volatility than many other managed futures investment options. 
About AltegrisAltegris is an investment research firm, with deep expertise in alternative manager selection, structuring unique solutions, and providing portfolio management and oversight. Beginning with an analysis of the current and anticipated investment environment, our solutions are based on themes that we believe solve the most important client needs. For more information about the Altegris family of alternative strategies, visit Altegris.com.
Please contact Maria Gonzalez at 212-279-3115 X 260 or mjgonzalez@prosek.com, or Brigitte Remy-Yee at 858-731-8666 or brigitte.remy.yee@altegris.com, for more information.
PLEASE CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE ALTEGRIS FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS. THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN EACH FUND'S PROSPECTUS AND THE SUMMARY PROSPECTUS, WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED BY CALLING (888) 524-9441. READ THE PROSPECTUS CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. 
Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC. Altegris Advisors and Northern Lights Distributors, LLC are not affiliated. 
MUTUAL FUNDS INVOLVE RISK INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.
Investing in commodity futures markets subjects the Fund to volatility as commodity futures prices are influenced by unfavorable weather, geologic and environmental factors, regulatory changes and restrictions. Trading on foreign exchanges and foreign investments including exposure to foreign currencies, involve risks not typically associated with US investments, including fluctuations in foreign currency values, adverse social and economic developments, less liquidity, greater volatility, less developed or inefficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. 
The Fund's use of derivatives such as futures, swaps, structured notes, and options contracts expose the Fund to additional risks such as leverage risk, tracking risk and counterparty default risk that it may not be subject to if it invested directly in the underlying securities. Although futures contracts are generally liquid, under certain market conditions there may not always be a liquid secondary market. Option positions held may expire worthless and cause a loss. 
The Fund may engage in short selling and short position derivative activities which are considered speculative and involve significant financial risk. Short positions profit from a decline in price so the Fund may incur a loss on a short position if the price increases. The potential for loss in shorting is unlimited. Shorting may also result in higher transaction costs which reduce return.
There is no guarantee that any of the trading strategies used by the managers retained will be successful. The adviser's judgments about the investment expertise of each manager may prove to be inaccurate and may not produce the desired results.
Altegris Advisors LLC is a CFTC-registered commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, NFA member, and SEC-registered investment adviser that sponsors and/or manages a platform of alternative investment products.
The Altegris group of affiliated companies is wholly-owned and controlled by (i) private equity funds managed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates ("Aquiline"), and by Genstar Capital Management, LLC and its affiliates ("Genstar"), and (ii) certain senior management of Altegris and other affiliates. Established in 2005, Aquiline focuses its investments exclusively in the financial services industry. Established in 1988, Genstar focuses its investment efforts across a variety of industries and sectors, including financial services. The Altegris companies include Altegris Investments, Altegris Advisors, and Altegris Clearing Solutions.

PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY INVESTMENT WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, GENERATE PROFITS OR AVOID LOSSES.
        


Hedge funds, commodity pools and other alternative investments involve a high degree of risk and can be illiquid due to restrictions on transfer and lack of a secondary trading market.  They can be highly leveraged, speculative and volatile, and an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of an investment.  Alternative investments may lack transparency as to share price, valuation and portfolio holdings.  Complex tax structures often result in delayed tax reporting.  Compared to mutual funds, hedge funds and commodity pools are subject to less regulation and often charge higher fees.  Mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal.  Alternative investment managers typically exercise broad investment discretion and may apply similar strategies across multiple investment vehicles, resulting in less diversification.  Trading may occur outside the United States which may pose greater risks than trading on U.S. exchanges and in U.S. markets. 
The Altegris group of affiliated companies is wholly-owned and controlled by (i) private equity  funds managed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates (“Aquiline”), and by Genstar  Capital Management, LLC and its affiliates (“Genstar”), and (ii) certain senior management of  Altegris and other affiliates. Established in 2005, Aquiline focuses its investments exclusively in  the financial services industry. Established in 1988, Genstar focuses its investment efforts across a variety of industries and sectors,  including financial services. The Altegris companies include Altegris Investments, Altegris  Advisors, and Altegris Clearing Solutions. As of March 31, 2017, Altegris and its affiliates have approximately $2.43 billion in client assets.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
