FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WM Partners, a Ft. Lauderdale-based private equity firm focused on investing in middle-market companies in the health and wellness sector, is announcing the final closing of the firm's first fund, HPH Specialized Fund 1, LP (together with its parallel fund, HPH Specialized International Fund 1, LP, "the Fund") with over $307 million in commitments. The Fund closed on June 30th, 2017 exceeding WM Partners' target of $300 million. 








The Fund received strong support from various prominent investors from North America, Latin America and Europe, including fund of funds, global private equity investment and advisory firms, insurance companies, and family offices, among others. The Fund received an anchor commitment from Vanterra Capital, a global private equity firm and fund seeding platform with a track record of partnering with specialized investment and operating teams. WM Partners' principals contributed the Fund's foundational investment through an in-kind contribution of Wellnext Holdings ("Wellnext"), a nutritional supplements company. 
The Fund is focused on acquiring lower-middle market companies with leading brands in the Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS) and Natural Personal Care sectors and integrating them into one consolidated platform, Wellnext. Headquartered in Sunrise, FL, Wellnext is a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of organic and natural plant and food-based supplements sold through specialty retail, natural retail and online / direct to consumer channels. To date, the Fund has closed on three acquisitions which have been integrated into the Wellnext platform, and the team has an active pipeline of proprietary acquisition targets in the VMS sector that it is currently evaluating. The Fund seeks to make equity investments of $15 million to $75 million in middle-market companies.
WM Partners was founded by Alejandro Weinstein and Jose Minski, who share over 20 years of experience working together. Mr. Weinstein is the former CEO of CFR Pharmaceuticals, where he orchestrated one of the largest IPOs in Latin America and ultimately sold to Abbott Laboratories in 2014.  Mr. Minski is the former co-founder and COO of Trolli, Inc., and led the company from a startup venture to its eventual sale to Texas Pacific Group. Mr. Minski also founded Wellnext. Jose Minski said: "We are extremely pleased with the support we have received from our limited partners in our first fund. We are proud of what we have accomplished to date, and are focused on being disciplined in our approach to building value for the Fund and our limited partners." 
Alejandro Weinstein added, "We are pleased to have successfully reached our Fund's target as we have an active pipeline of internally generated acquisition opportunities that we intend to execute over the next few years.  With these potential acquisitions, we strive to become one of the leading players in the natural VMS space." 
About WM Partners, LP 
WM Partners is a middle-market private equity firm specialized in buyout investments in the health and wellness sectors. WM Partners seeks to acquire small and medium size businesses with attractive growth prospects and generate sustainable, long-term value through its operational expertise in the health and wellness sectors, and strategic business approach working in collaboration with experienced management teams.

Andrew Rolfe Exiting Gap International
Andrew Rolfe, president of the Gap International division of Gap Inc. for the past two years, is leaving the company to take a senior position at a private equity firm, TowerBrook Capital Partners LP.






















WWD Staff 


NEW YORK — Andrew Rolfe, president of the Gap Inter­national division of Gap Inc. for the past two years, is leaving the company to take a senior position at a private equity firm, TowerBrook Capital Partners LP. Gap will not fill the post, and the international units will report to Paul Pressler, president and chief executive officer of Gap Inc."Now that we have built a strong, more decentralized international organization, Andrew feels it's the appropriate time for him to take on new challenges," Pressler said in a statement. "I want to thank Andrew for his many contributions."The Gap said in its announcement that since 2004, "the international division has shifted its business model by moving key functions, such as merchandising and marketing, into local markets and building a dedicated international product design and development team. The unit also successfully launched Banana Republic in Japan and established an international franchise business."The international division reported sales of $1.5 billion for 2004, when Gap Inc. had total sales of $16.3 billion, according to the most recent figures available. The international unit has had some ups and downs. About two years ago, the division slowed expansion to a trickle to correct problems and learn more about local tastes, pricing and marketing.In his statement, Pressler said, "We've made tremendous progress in building our international infrastructure over the past two years. International expansion continues to be a key component of our company's long-term growth strategies." Joint ventures, franchising, stores-within-stores and licensing are being pursued overseas, in a shift from Gap's reliance on operating wholly owned stores. Internationally, there are about 450 stores in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and France. Gap Inc. operates more than 3,100 units around the world.Rolfe's last day with Gap is Feb. 17. Before joining the company, he was chairman and ceo of Pret A Manger, a London-based food retailer.Over the last several months, the Gap has had many senior executive changes, and just last week named John T. Wyatt president of GapBody. He was previously president and ceo of Cutter & Buck apparel, and before that, was ceo of Parisian.

Advances in underlying materials and processes are revolutionizing almost every industry.
We look for transformative Advanced Materials innovations, including novel engineered materials, new device architectures, and advanced process technologies and tools. We invest in innovations that enable entirely new products, dramatic performance improvements of existing products, enhanced-efficiency, and/or greener manufacturing processes for major industries such as Consumer Electronics, Drug Delivery, Chemicals, Energy Generation, Energy Storage, Solar, Water, and Building Materials to name a few.
Estimates of the industrial impact of Advanced Materials innovations over the next decade exceed $3 Trillion.
 




Reinventing Venture Capital
Advanced Materials is a significant yet under-served area of innovation by venture capitalists.  It requires specialized knowledge of materials sciences, industrial value chains, and business models.  At PVP, we have developed a unique value-add approach based on successfully founding, operating, and investing in advanced material start-ups over the past 30 years.
 
 
 
 

 



Our Team
We understand that teams are the most important ingredient in any start-up. Meet our team. We have an unparalleled success rate, with some failures too. We are constantly learning and enjoy working with entrepreneurs.
