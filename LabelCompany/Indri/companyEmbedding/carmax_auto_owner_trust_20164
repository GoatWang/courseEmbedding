NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings and Outlooks to the CarMax Auto Owner 
      Trust 2016-4 (CAOT 2016-4) notes as follows:
    

      --$243,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$427,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$428,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$130,500,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$25,950,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,100,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,450,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2016-4 is in line with the prior six 
      transactions from a collateral credit quality perspective. The WA FICO 
      is 705, and the amount of loans with terms greater than 60 month loans 
      is consistent at 59.9%.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: CAOT 2016-4 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. The initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for class A and B is 
      lower than the last transaction rated by Fitch, while initial hard CE 
      for the class C is higher and D notes is unchanged compared to those in 
      the last transaction. The initial CE is sufficient to withstand Fitch's 
      base case cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy of 2.40% for all classes of 
      notes at each class' respective loss coverage multiple.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CAF's portfolio 
      and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen 
      in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: Fitch believes CAF to be 
      a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for 2016-4.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses that could 
      lead to potential downgrades of up to two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

      2016-4 is consistent with the prior five transactions. The WA FICO is 
      705, WA LTV is 94.8%, used vehicles total 99.7%, and loans with terms 
      greater than 60 month loans is 59.8%, consistent with prior series.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: 2016-4 incorporates a sequential-pay structure. 
      Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A and B notes is down 
      than the last transaction rated by Fitch (2016-3), while initial hard CE 
      for the class C and D notes is unchanged. The initial CE is sufficient 
      to withstand Fitch's base case cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy of 2.40% 
      for all classes of notes at each class' respective loss coverage 
      multiple.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      CAF's total portfolio and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below 
      the peak levels seen in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: Fitch believes CarMax 
      Business Services, LLC (CBS). to be a capable originator, underwriter 
      and servicer for this series.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.}
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-3 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they 
      could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 - Appendix'. 
      These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      May 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

Withholding Tax is applicable, the Noteholder FATCA
Information.

by its acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a
beneficial interest in a Note, agrees that the Indenture Trustee

payable to a Noteholder or holder of an interest in a Note that
fails to comply with the requirements of
SectionÂ 2.4(b).

are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the Noteholder making such surrender,
in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or
more new Notes of the same Class in any authorized denomination, of
a like aggregate principal amount. The Indenture Trustee may rely
upon the Administrator with respect to the determination of whether

the Relevant UCC are met.

requirements of SectionÂ 8-401 or 8A-401, as applicable, of the
Relevant UCC are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Noteholder making
such exchange, the Notes which such Noteholder is entitled to
receive. The Indenture Trustee may rely upon the Administrator with
respect to the determination of whether the requirements of
SectionÂ 8-401 or 8A-401, as applicable, of the Relevant UCC
are met.

registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled

surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer

Holder thereof or such Holderâs attorney duly authorized in
writing, with such signature guaranteed by an âeligible
guarantor institutionâ meeting the requirements of the Note
Registrar.

(g) No service charge shall be made
to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes,
but the Indenture Trustee may require payment by such Holder of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to
SectionÂ 2.3 or SectionÂ 9.6 not involving any
transfer.

(h) The Issuer shall not be required
to make, and the Note Registrar need not register, transfers or
exchanges of Notes selected for redemption or Notes with respect to
which the due date for any payment will occur within fifteen
(15)Â days.

(i) Each Person who initially
acquires a Note (or an interest therein) or to whom a Note (or an
interest therein) is transferred will be deemed to have represented

therein), that either (a)Â it is not acquiring the Note (or an
interest therein) with the plan assets of any
(i)Â âemployee benefit planâ (as defined in
SectionÂ 3(3) of ERISA) subject to the fiduciary requirements
of ERISA, (ii)Â âplanâ described in
SectionÂ 4975(e)(1) of the Code, including individual
retirement accounts and Keogh plans, that is subject to the
provisions of SectionÂ 4975 of the Code, or (iii)Â employee
benefit plan or arrangement not subject to Title I of ERISA or
SectionÂ 4975 of the Code; or (b)Â the acquisition and
holding of the Note (or an interest therein) will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt âprohibited transactionâ under
SectionÂ 406 of ERISA or SectionÂ 4975 of the Code or a
violation of any substantially similar applicable law.

receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Note, and (ii)Â there is delivered to the
Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by
it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in
the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a
âprotected purchaserâ (as defined in the Relevant UCC),
and provided that the requirements of SectionÂ 8-405 or 8A-405,
as applicable, of the Relevant UCC are met, the Issuer shall
execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Note, a replacement Note of the same Class;

or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall have become or
within seven (7)Â days of the Indenture Trusteeâs receipt
of evidence to its satisfaction of such destruction, loss or theft
shall be due and payable, or shall have been called for redemption

replacement Note of the same Class, the Issuer may pay such
destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon
the
Â 
7


Redemption Date without surrender thereof. The
Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely upon the Administrator with
respect to the determination of whether the requirements of
SectionÂ 8-405 or 8A-405, as applicable, of the Relevant UCC
are met. If, after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment
of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the

in the Relevant UCC) of the original Note in lieu of which such
replacement Note was issued presents for payment such original
Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to
recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to
whom such replacement Note was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a âprotected
purchaserâ (as defined in the Relevant UCC), and shall be
entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided
therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense
incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in connection
therewith.

(b) Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this SectionÂ 2.6, the Issuer may
require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with such issuance and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) related
thereto.

(c) Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this SectionÂ 2.6 in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

(d) The provisions of this
SectionÂ 2.6 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent
lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the

representing beneficial interests aggregating not less than 51% of
the principal amount of such Notes advise the Indenture Trustee and
the Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation of a
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the
best interests of such Note Owners, then the Clearing Agency shall
notify all Note Owners and the Indenture Trustee in writing of the
occurrence of such event and of the availability of Definitive
Notes to Note Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the
Indenture Trustee of the typewritten Notes representing the
Book-Entry Notes by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by
registration instructions, the Issuer, at its own expense, shall
execute and deliver the Definitive Notes to the Indenture Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate the Definitive Notes
in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of
the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be

Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes as

SectionÂ 2.3, SectionÂ 2.5 and SectionÂ 2.6, as fully
to all intents and purposes as though each such Authenticating
Agent had been expressly authorized by those Sections to

SectionÂ 2.14 shall be deemed to be the authentication of Notes
âby the Indenture Trusteeâ.

Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger,
consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall

Authenticating Agent or such successor entity.

any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee. The Indenture Trustee may
at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent
and the Owner Trustee. Upon receiving such notice of resignation or
upon such a termination, the Indenture Trustee may appoint a
successor Authenticating Agent and shall give written notice of any
such appointment to the Owner Trustee.

Â 



Â 


(i)


hold all sums
held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to the Notes

Â

or of any Paying Agent at the last address of record for each such
Holder).

SectionÂ 3.4 Existence .
The Issuer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of
Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is
or becomes, organized under the laws of any other State or of the
United States, in which case the Issuer shall keep in full effect
its existence, rights and franchises under the laws of such other
jurisdiction) and shall obtain and preserve its qualification to do

shall be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of
this Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral and each other instrument
or agreement included in the Trust Estate.

SectionÂ 3.5 Protection of
Trust Estate .

(a) The Issuer shall from time to
time authorize, execute and deliver all such supplements and
amendments hereto and all such financing statements, continuation
statements, instruments of further assurance and other instruments,
and shall take such other action, necessary or advisable
to:
Â 



Â 


(i)


maintain or
preserve the lien and security interest (and the priority thereof)

hereof;



Â

Indenture Trustee to file any financing statement and amendments
thereto that indicate the Collateral (A)Â as all assets of the

Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Relevant UCC,
or (B)Â as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater
detail. If the Indenture Trustee prepares or files any such
financing statement, continuation statement or amendment thereto,

either stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such action
has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording
and refiling of this Indenture, any indentures supplemental hereto
and any other requisite documents and with respect to the
authorization and filing of any financing statements and
continuation statements as is necessary to maintain the lien and
security interest created by this Indenture and reciting the
details of such action or stating that, in the opinion of such

recording, filing, re-recording and refiling of this Indenture, any
indentures supplemental hereto and any other requisite documents
and the authorization and filing of any financing statements and
continuation statements that shall, in the opinion of such counsel,
be required to maintain the lien and security interest of this
Indenture until MarchÂ 31 in the following year.

SectionÂ 3.7 Performance of
Obligations; Servicing of Receivables .

(a) The Issuer shall not take any
action and shall use its best efforts not to permit any action to
be taken by others that would release any Person from any of such
Personâs material covenants or obligations under any
instrument or agreement included in the Trust Estate or that would
result in the amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination
or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any
such instrument or agreement, except as expressly provided in this
Indenture and the other Transaction Documents.

(b) The Issuer may contract with
other Persons to assist it in performing its duties under this
Indenture, and any performance of such duties by a Person
identified to the Indenture Trustee in an Issuerâs
Certificate shall be deemed to be action taken by the Issuer.
Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the Servicer and the
Administrator to assist the Issuer in performing its duties under
this Indenture.

(c) The Issuer shall punctually
perform and observe all of its obligations and agreements contained
in this Indenture, the other Transaction Documents and the
instruments and agreements included in the Trust Estate, including
filing or causing to be filed all financing statements and
continuation statements required to be filed under the Relevant UCC
by the terms of this Indenture and the Sale and Servicing Agreement
in accordance with and within the time periods provided for herein
and therein.
Â 
19



(d) If the Issuer shall have
knowledge of the occurrence of an Event of Servicing Termination,
the Issuer shall promptly notify the Depositor, the Indenture
Trustee, the Rating Agencies and the Administrator in writing of
such event and shall specify in such notice the action, if any, the
Issuer is taking in respect of such default. If an Event of
Servicing Termination shall arise from the failure of the Servicer
to perform any of its duties or obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer
shall take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure.

(e) As promptly as possible after
the giving of notice of termination to the Servicer of the
Servicerâs rights and powers pursuant to SectionÂ 8.1 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer may (subject to the
rights of the Indenture Trustee to direct such appointment pursuant
to SectionÂ 8.2 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement) appoint a
successor servicer (the â Successor Servicer â),
and such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a
written assumption in a form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee.
In the event that a Successor Servicer has not been appointed or
has not accepted its appointment at the time when the Servicer
ceases to act as Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, without further
action, shall be the successor to the Servicer in all respects in
accordance with SectionÂ 8.2 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement. The Indenture Trustee may resign as the Servicer by
giving written notice of such resignation to the Issuer and in such
event shall be released from such duties and obligations, such
release not to be effective until the date a new servicer enters
into a servicing agreement with the Issuer as provided below. Upon
delivery of any such notice to the Issuer, the Issuer shall obtain
a new servicer as the Successor Servicer under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement. Any Successor Servicer (other than the
Indenture Trustee) shall (i)Â be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of motor vehicle
installment sale contracts and (ii)Â enter into a servicing
agreement with the Issuer having substantially the same provisions
as the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to
the Servicer. If, within thirty (30)Â days after the delivery
of the notice referred to above, the Issuer shall not have obtained
such a new servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a Successor
Servicer. In connection with any such appointment, the Indenture
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such
successor as it and such successor shall agree, subject to the
limitations set forth below and in the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, and, in accordance with SectionÂ 8.2 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall enter into an agreement with
such successor for the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement
to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee).
If the Indenture Trustee shall succeed to the Servicerâs
duties as servicer of the Receivables as provided herein, it shall
do so in its individual capacity and not in its capacity as
Indenture Trustee and, accordingly, the provisions of Article VI
shall be inapplicable to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the Receivables. In
case the Indenture Trustee shall become successor to the Servicer
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to appoint as Servicer any one of its Affiliates;
provided , however , that the Indenture Trustee, in
its capacity as the Servicer, shall be fully liable for the actions
and omissions of such Affiliate in such capacity as Successor
Servicer. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture to
the contrary, in no event shall the Indenture Trustee be liable for
any servicing fee or for any differential in the amount of the
servicing fee paid under the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the
amount necessary to induce any Successor Servicer to act as
Successor Servicer under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.
Â 
20



(f) Upon any termination of the
Servicerâs rights and powers pursuant to SectionÂ 8.1 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall promptly notify
the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the Administrator and the
Rating Agencies in writing of such termination. Upon any
appointment of a Successor Servicer by the Issuer, the Issuer shall
promptly notify the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the
Administrator and the Rating Agencies in writing of such
appointment, specifying in such notice the name and address of such
Successor Servicer.

(g) The Issuer shall not waive
timely performance by the Depositor, the Seller or the Servicer of
their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents if
such waiver would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the interests of the Noteholders.

SectionÂ 3.8 Negative
Covenants .

the Issuer shall not:
Â 



Â 


(i)


except as
expressly permitted by this Indenture, the Trust Agreement, the
Receivables Purchase Agreement or the Sale and Servicing Agreement,

Trustee;

hereby, (B)Â permit any lien (including any lien arising in
connection with any tax imposed under HB3), charge, excise, claim,
security interest, mortgage or other encumbrance (other than the
lien of this Indenture) to be created on or extend to or otherwise
arise upon or burden the Trust Estate or any part thereof or any
interest therein or the proceeds thereof (other than tax liens,
mechanicsâ liens and other liens that arise by operation of
law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and arising
solely as a result of an action or omission of the related Obligor)
or (C)Â permit the lien of this Indenture not to constitute a
valid and perfected first priority (other than with respect to any
such tax, mechanicsâ or other lien) security interest in the
Trust Estate;



Â 
21





Â 


(v)


engage in any
activities other than financing, acquiring, owning, pledging and
managing the Receivables as contemplated by the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Sale and Servicing
Agreement and this Indenture and activities incidental to such
activities; or



Â 



Â 


(vi)


incur, assume
or guarantee any indebtedness other than the indebtedness evidenced
by the Notes or indebtedness otherwise permitted by the Receivables

SectionÂ 5.5 Optional
Preservation of the Receivables . If the Notes have been

that the Available Funds shall be applied in accordance with such
declaration of acceleration in the manner specified in
SectionÂ 5.4(b) as provided in SectionÂ 4.6(d) of the Sale

action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such
purpose.

unless:
Â 



Â 


(i)


such Holder has
previously given written notice to the Indenture Trustee of a
continuing Event of Default;



Â 



Â 


(ii)


the Holders of
Notes evidencing not less than 25% of the Note Balance of the

Default in its own name as Indenture Trustee hereunder;



Â 



Â 


(iii)


such Holder or
Holders have offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in
complying with such request;



Â 
36





Â 


(iv)


the Indenture
Trustee for sixty (60)Â days after its receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute such
Proceedings; and

(v)


no direction
inconsistent with such written request has been given to the
Indenture Trustee during suchÂ 60-dayÂ period by the
Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 51% of the Note Balance
of the Controlling Class.




(b) It is understood and intended
that no one or more Holders of Notes shall have any right in any
manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of
this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any
other Holders of Notes or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority
or preference over any other Holders of Notes or to enforce any
right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided.

(c) In the event the Indenture
Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and
indemnity from two or more groups of Holders of Notes, each
evidencing less than 51% of the Note Balance of the Controlling
Class, the Indenture Trustee will take action in accordance with
the direction of the greatest amount of Holders of Notes (measured
by principal balance).

SectionÂ 5.7 Unconditional
Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal and Interest .
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Holder
of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest,
if any, on such Note on the respective due dates thereof expressed
in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption,
on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement
of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without
the consent of such Holder.

SectionÂ 5.8 Restoration of
Rights and Remedies . If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee or such Noteholder, then and in
every such case the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

SectionÂ 5.9 Rights and
Remedies Cumulative . No right or remedy herein conferred upon
or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion
or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall
not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.

SectionÂ 5.10 Delay or
Omission Not a Waiver . No delay or omission of the Indenture
Trustee or any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing
upon any Default or Event of
Â 
37


Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or any
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article
V or by law to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders may be
exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders, as the case
may be.

SectionÂ 5.11 Control by
Noteholders of the Controlling Class .

(a) The Holders of Notes evidencing
not less than 51% of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture
Trustee with respect to the Notes or exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Indenture Trustee; provided, however,
that:
Â 



Â 


(i)


such direction
shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this
Indenture;



Â 



Â 


(ii)


subject to the
express terms of SectionÂ 5.4, any written direction to the
Indenture Trustee to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall be by
the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 100% of the Note
Balance;



Â 



Â 


(iii)


if the
conditions set forth in SectionÂ 5.5 have been satisfied and
the Indenture Trustee elects to retain the Trust Estate pursuant to
such section, then any written direction to the Indenture Trustee
by the Holders of Notes evidencing less than 100% of the Note
Balance to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall be of no force
and effect; and



Â 



Â 


(iv)


the Indenture
Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Indenture
Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.




(b) Notwithstanding the rights of
Noteholders set forth in this SectionÂ 5.11, subject to
SectionÂ 6.1, the Indenture Trustee need not take any action
that it reasonably believes might involve it in costs, expenses and
liabilities for which it will not be adequately indemnified or
might materially adversely affect the rights of any Noteholders not
consenting to such action.

SectionÂ 5.12 Waiver of Past
Defaults . Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes as provided in SectionÂ 5.2, the Holders
of Notes evidencing not less than 51% of the Note Balance of the
Controlling Class, may, on behalf of all Noteholders, waive any
past Default or Event of Default and its consequences except a
Default or Event of Default (i)Â in the payment of principal of
or interest on any of the Notes or (ii)Â in respect of a
covenant or provision hereof that cannot be amended, supplemented
or modified without the consent of all the Noteholders. Upon any
such waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder,
respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereto. Upon any such waiver, such Default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to
have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be
deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every
purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.
Â 
38



SectionÂ 5.13 Undertaking for
Costs . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of
any Note by such Holderâs acceptance thereof shall be deemed
to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in
any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee for any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture Trustee, the
filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion
assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneyâs
fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such
party litigant; provided, however, that the provisions of this
SectionÂ 5.13 shall not apply to (i)Â any suit instituted
by the Indenture Trustee, (ii)Â any suit instituted by any
Noteholder or group of Noteholders, in each case holding Notes
evidencing in the aggregate more than 10% of the Note Balance (or,
in the case of any suit which is instituted by the Controlling
Class, more than 10% of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class)
or (iii)Â any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the
enforcement of the payment of principal of or interest on any Note
on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note and in
this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the
Redemption Date).

SectionÂ 5.14 Waiver of Stay
or Extension Laws . The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it
may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, or
plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at
any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture, and the Issuer (to the extent that
it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not hinder,
delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the
Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

SectionÂ 5.15 Action on
Notes . The Indenture Trusteeâs right to seek and recover
judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected
by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other relief under
or with respect to this Indenture. Neither the lien of this
Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or
the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment
by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any
execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust Estate
or upon any of the assets of the Issuer. Any money or property
collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance
with SectionÂ 5.4(b).

SectionÂ 5.16 Performance and
Enforcement of Certain Obligations.

(a) Promptly following a request
from the Indenture Trustee to do so, and at the
Administratorâs expense (or, if the Indenture Trustee is then
acting as the Administrator, at the expense of CarMax), the Issuer
shall take all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may
request to compel or secure the performance and observance by the
Depositor and the Servicer of their respective obligations to the
Issuer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement

such action shall be suspended.

(c) Promptly following a request
from the Indenture Trustee to do so and at the
Administratorâs expense, the Issuer agrees to take all such
lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may request to compel or
secure the performance and observance by the Seller of its
obligations to the Depositor under or in connection with the
Receivables Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof, and to exercise any and all rights, remedies, powers and

Indenture Trustee.

(a) If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall
exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and

conduct of such Personâs own affairs.
Â 
40

an Event of Default:
Â

the Indenture
Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as
are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against
the Indenture Trustee, and any discretion, permissive right or

Â 


(ii)


in the absence
of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively
rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the
opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished
to the Indenture Trustee and, if required by the terms of this
Indenture, conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;
provided , however , that the Indenture Trustee shall
examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not
they conform on their face to the requirements of this
Indenture.




(c) The Indenture Trustee may not be
relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except
that:
Â 



Â 


(i)


this paragraph
does not limit the effect of paragraph (b)Â of this
SectionÂ 6.1;



Â 



Â 


(ii)


the Indenture
Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the

Â 


(iii)


the Indenture
Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or
omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received

shall require the Indenture Trustee to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of

powers hereunder if the Indenture Trustee shall have reasonable
grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or indemnity
satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not assured or
provided to it.

Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Indenture Trustee shall be subject to

Default, breach of a representation or warranty or other event or
(ii)Â written notice of such Event of Default, breach of a
representation or warranty or other event shall have been given to
the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this
Indenture; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, the

the Indenture Trustee.

(j) Subject to Sections 6.1(a) and

indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without

efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the
circumstances.

(k) The Indenture Trustee shall have
the right to decline to follow any investor direction if the

good faith determines that the action or proceeding so directed
would involve it in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial
to the non-directing holders.

(l) The Indenture Trustee shall not
have any obligation to investigate any matter or to exercise any
powers vested by the Indenture Trustee unless requested by 25% or

appointed with due care by it hereunder.

(d) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith
which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers;
provided , however , that such action or omission by
the Indenture Trustee does not constitute willful misconduct,
negligence or bad faith.

(e) The Indenture Trustee may
consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with
respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Notes
shall be full and complete authorization and protection from
liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or
opinion of such counsel.

(f) The Indenture Trustee shall be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested

satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction.

(g) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated

discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into
such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Indenture
Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records
and premises of the Issuer, personally or by agent or

SectionÂ 6.3 Individual
Rights of Indenture Trustee . The Indenture Trustee, in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee
of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates
with the same rights it would have if it were not Indenture
Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Note Registrar, co-registrar or
co-paying agent hereunder may do the same with like
rights.
Â 
43



SectionÂ 6.4 Indenture
Trusteeâs Disclaimer . The Indenture Trustee
(i)Â shall not be responsible for, and makes no representation
as to, the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes,
(ii)Â shall not be accountable for the Issuerâs use of
the proceeds from the Notes or responsible for any statement of the
Issuer in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection
with the sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the Indenture
Trusteeâs certificate of authentication and (iii)Â shall
not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any other party,
including the Servicer, Seller and Depositor, and may assume each
other partyâs performance of its obligations under the Trust
Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Sale and
Servicing Agreement absent written notice or actual knowledge of a
Responsible Officer to the contrary.

SectionÂ 6.5 Notice of
Defaults . If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and
if it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder and the
Administrator notice of such Event of Default within ninety
(90)Â days after it occurs. Except in the case of an Event of
Default described in SectionÂ 5.1(a)(i) or (ii)Â (including
payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such
Note), the Indenture Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long
as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines
that withholding the notice is in the interests of
Noteholders.

SectionÂ 6.6 Reports by
Indenture Trustee to Holders . The Indenture Trustee shall make
available, within a reasonable period of time after the end of each
calendar year, to each Person who at any time during such calendar

Trustee as may be required to enable such Person to prepare its
federal and State income tax returns.

SectionÂ 6.7 Compensation and
Indemnity .

(a) The Administrator, on behalf of
the Issuer, shall pay to the Indenture Trustee from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services. The Indenture
Trusteeâs compensation shall not be limited by any law on
compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Administrator,
on behalf of the Issuer, shall reimburse the Indenture Trustee for
all expenses, advances and disbursements reasonably incurred or
made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the
compensation for its services; provided, however, that the
Administrator need not reimburse the Indenture Trustee for any
expense incurred through the Indenture Trusteeâs willful
misconduct, negligence, or bad faith. Such expenses shall include
the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Indenture Trusteeâs agents, counsel,
accountants and experts. The Administrator, on behalf of the
Issuer, shall indemnify the Indenture Trustee for, and hold it and
its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents,
harmless against, any and all loss, liability or expense (including
reasonable attorneysâ fees and expenses and court costs, and
any loss or expense incurred in connection with a successful
defense, in whole or in part, of any claim that the Indenture
Trustee breached its standard of care) incurred by it in connection
with the administration of this trust and the performance of its
duties hereunder; provided, however, that the Administrator need
not indemnify the Indenture Trustee for, or hold it harmless
against, any such loss, liability or
Â 
44


expense incurred through the Indenture
Trusteeâs willful misconduct, negligence, or bad faith. The
Indenture Trustee shall notify the Issuer and the Administrator
promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Any failure
by the Indenture Trustee to so notify the Issuer and the
Administrator shall not, however, relieve the Administrator of its
obligations hereunder. The Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer,
shall defend any such claim. The Indenture Trustee may have
separate counsel in connection with the defense of any such claim,
and the Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, shall pay the fees
and expenses of such counsel. If the Indenture Trustee is then
acting as Administrator, all payment obligations to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to this SectionÂ 6.7 shall be paid by
CarMax.
