NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings and Outlooks to the CarMax Auto Owner 
      Trust 2016-4 (CAOT 2016-4) notes as follows:
    

      --$243,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$427,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$428,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$130,500,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$25,950,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,100,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,450,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2016-4 is in line with the prior six 
      transactions from a collateral credit quality perspective. The WA FICO 
      is 705, and the amount of loans with terms greater than 60 month loans 
      is consistent at 59.9%.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: CAOT 2016-4 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. The initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for class A and B is 
      lower than the last transaction rated by Fitch, while initial hard CE 
      for the class C is higher and D notes is unchanged compared to those in 
      the last transaction. The initial CE is sufficient to withstand Fitch's 
      base case cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy of 2.40% for all classes of 
      notes at each class' respective loss coverage multiple.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CAF's portfolio 
      and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen 
      in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: Fitch believes CAF to be 
      a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for 2016-4.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses that could 
      lead to potential downgrades of up to two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

      Adequate CE Structure: 2016-4 incorporates a sequential-pay structure. 
      Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A and B notes is down 
      than the last transaction rated by Fitch (2016-3), while initial hard CE 
      for the class C and D notes is unchanged. The initial CE is sufficient 
      to withstand Fitch's base case cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy of 2.40% 
      for all classes of notes at each class' respective loss coverage 
      multiple.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      CAF's total portfolio and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below 
      the peak levels seen in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: Fitch believes CarMax 
      Business Services, LLC (CBS). to be a capable originator, underwriter 
      and servicer for this series.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.}
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-3 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they 
      could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 - Appendix'. 
      These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      May 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

Section 2.4 Tax

(a) The Issuer has entered into this

Notes shall qualify as indebtedness of the Issuer secured by the
Trust Estate. The Issuer, by entering into this Indenture, and each
Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note (and each Note Owner by its
acceptance of an interest in the applicable Book-Entry Note), agree
to treat the Notes as indebtedness of the Issuer for federal, State
and local income and franchise tax purposes.

(b) Each Noteholder or Note Owner,
by its acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a
beneficial interest in a Note, agrees to provide to the Indenture
Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Issuer, upon its request, the
Noteholder Tax Identification Information and, to the extent FATCA
Withholding Tax is applicable, the Noteholder FATCA
Information.

(c) Each Noteholder or Note Owner,
by its acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a
beneficial interest in a Note, agrees that the Indenture Trustee
has the right to withhold any amounts of interest (properly
withholdable under law and without any corresponding gross-up)
payable to a Noteholder or holder of an interest in a Note that
fails to comply with the requirements of
Section 2.4(b).

Section 2.5 Registration;
Registration of Transfer and Exchange.

(a) The Indenture Trustee initially
shall be the registrar (the “ Note Registrar ”)
for the purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as
herein provided. The Note Registrar shall cause to be kept a
register (the “ Note Register ”) in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the
Note Registrar shall provide for the registration of Notes and the
registration of transfers of Notes. Upon any resignation of any
Note Registrar, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor or,
if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume the duties of
Note Registrar.

(b) If a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar,
(i) the Issuer shall give the Indenture Trustee prompt written
notice of the appointment of such Note Registrar and of the
location, or any change in the location, of the Note Register,
(ii) the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to inspect the
Note Register at all reasonable times and to obtain copies thereof
and (iii) the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to rely
upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an
Executive Officer thereof as to the names and addresses of the
Holders of the Notes and the principal amounts and number of such
Notes.

(c) Upon surrender for registration
of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the Issuer to be
maintained as provided in Section 3.2, if the requirements of
Section 8-401 or 8A-401, as applicable, of the Relevant UCC
are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the Noteholder making such surrender,
in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or
more new Notes of the same Class in any authorized denomination, of
a like aggregate principal amount. The Indenture Trustee may rely
upon the Administrator with respect to the determination of whether
the requirements of Section 8-401 or 8A-401, as applicable, of
the Relevant UCC are met.

(d) At the option of the Noteholder,
Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, if the
requirements of Section 8-401 or 8A-401, as applicable, of the
Relevant UCC are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Noteholder making
such exchange, the Notes which such Noteholder is entitled to
receive. The Indenture Trustee may rely upon the Administrator with
respect to the determination of whether the requirements of
Section 8-401 or 8A-401, as applicable, of the Relevant UCC
are met.

(e) All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled

6



(f) All Notes presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the
Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing, with such signature guaranteed by an “eligible
guarantor institution” meeting the requirements of the Note
Registrar.

(g) No service charge shall be made
to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes,
but the Indenture Trustee may require payment by such Holder of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to
Section 2.3 or Section 9.6 not involving any
transfer.

(h) The Issuer shall not be required
to make, and the Note Registrar need not register, transfers or
exchanges of Notes selected for redemption or Notes with respect to
which the due date for any payment will occur within fifteen
(15) days.

(i) Each Person who initially
acquires a Note (or an interest therein) or to whom a Note (or an
interest therein) is transferred will be deemed to have represented
and warranted, by its acceptance of the Note (or an interest
therein), that either (a) it is not acquiring the Note (or an
interest therein) with the plan assets of any
(i) “employee benefit plan” (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to the fiduciary requirements
of ERISA, (ii) “plan” described in
Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, including individual
retirement accounts and Keogh plans, that is subject to the
provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, or (iii) employee
benefit plan or arrangement not subject to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code; or (b) the acquisition and
holding of the Note (or an interest therein) will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt “prohibited transaction” under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
violation of any substantially similar applicable law.

(j) Any purported transfer of a Note
not in accordance with this Section 2.5 shall be null and void

whatsoever.

Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes.

is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee
receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the
Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by
it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in
the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a
“protected purchaser” (as defined in the Relevant UCC),
and provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 or 8A-405,
as applicable, of the Relevant UCC are met, the Issuer shall
execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Note, a replacement Note of the same Class;
provided , however , that if any such destroyed, lost
or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall have become or
within seven (7) days of the Indenture Trustee’s receipt
of evidence to its satisfaction of such destruction, loss or theft
shall be due and payable, or shall have been called for redemption
in whole pursuant to Section 10.1, instead of issuing a
replacement Note of the same Class, the Issuer may pay such
destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon
the
 
7


Redemption Date without surrender thereof. The
Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely upon the Administrator with
respect to the determination of whether the requirements of
Section 8-405 or 8A-405, as applicable, of the Relevant UCC
are met. If, after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment
of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the
preceding sentence, a “protected purchaser” (as defined
in the Relevant UCC) of the original Note in lieu of which such
replacement Note was issued presents for payment such original
Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to
recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to
whom such replacement Note was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a “protected
purchaser” (as defined in the Relevant UCC), and shall be
entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided
therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense
incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in connection
therewith.

(b) Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section 2.6, the Issuer may
require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with such issuance and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) related
thereto.

(c) Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section 2.6 in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

(d) The provisions of this
Section 2.6 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent
lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes.

Section 2.7 Persons Deemed
Owners . Prior to due presentation of a Note for registration
of transfer, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the

Register (as of the day of determination) as the owner of such Note
for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and interest
on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not

Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary.

occurrence of such event and of the availability of Definitive
Notes to Note Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the

Book-Entry Notes by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by
registration instructions, the Issuer, at its own expense, shall
execute and deliver the Definitive Notes to the Indenture Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate the Definitive Notes
in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of
the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be

instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, the Indenture
Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes as

to all intents and purposes as though each such Authenticating
Agent had been expressly authorized by those Sections to
authenticate such Notes. For all purposes of this Indenture, the
authentication of Notes by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.14 shall be deemed to be the authentication of Notes
“by the Indenture Trustee”.

(b) Any entity into which any
Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger,
consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall
be a party, or any entity succeeding to all or substantially all of
the corporate trust business of any Authenticating
Agent,

Authenticating Agent or such successor entity.

any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee. The Indenture Trustee may
at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent
and the Owner Trustee. Upon receiving such notice of resignation or
upon such a termination, the Indenture Trustee may appoint a
successor Authenticating Agent and shall give written notice of any
such appointment to the Owner Trustee.

(c) The Issuer shall cause each
Paying Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and
deliver to the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying
Agent shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture

provisions of this Section 3.3, that such Paying Agent
shall:
 



 


(i)


hold all sums
held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to the Notes

surrendered for redemption in whole pursuant to Section 10.1
or whose right to or interest in monies due and payable but not

or of any Paying Agent at the last address of record for each such
Holder).

Section 3.4 Existence .
The Issuer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of
Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is

United States, in which case the Issuer shall keep in full effect
its existence, rights and franchises under the laws of such other
jurisdiction) and shall obtain and preserve its qualification to do
business in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or
shall be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of
this Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral and each other instrument
or agreement included in the Trust Estate.

Section 3.5 Protection of
Trust Estate .

(a) The Issuer shall from time to
time authorize, execute and deliver all such supplements and
amendments hereto and all such financing statements, continuation

(i)

to the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
either stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such action
has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording
and refiling of this Indenture, any indentures supplemental hereto
and any other requisite documents and with respect to the
authorization and filing of any financing statements and
continuation statements as is necessary to maintain the lien and
security interest created by this Indenture and reciting the
details of such action or stating that, in the opinion of such
counsel, no such action is necessary to maintain such lien and

recording, filing, re-recording and refiling of this Indenture, any
indentures supplemental hereto and any other requisite documents
and the authorization and filing of any financing statements and
continuation statements that shall, in the opinion of such counsel,
be required to maintain the lien and security interest of this
Indenture until March 31 in the following year.

Section 3.7 Performance of
Obligations; Servicing of Receivables .

(a) The Issuer shall not take any
action and shall use its best efforts not to permit any action to
be taken by others that would release any Person from any of such
Person’s material covenants or obligations under any
instrument or agreement included in the Trust Estate or that would
result in the amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination
or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any
such instrument or agreement, except as expressly provided in this
Indenture and the other Transaction Documents.

(b) The Issuer may contract with
other Persons to assist it in performing its duties under this
Indenture, and any performance of such duties by a Person
identified to the Indenture Trustee in an Issuer’s
Certificate shall be deemed to be action taken by the Issuer.
Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the Servicer and the
Administrator to assist the Issuer in performing its duties under
this Indenture.

(c) The Issuer shall punctually
perform and observe all of its obligations and agreements contained
in this Indenture, the other Transaction Documents and the
instruments and agreements included in the Trust Estate, including
filing or causing to be filed all financing statements and
continuation statements required to be filed under the Relevant UCC
by the terms of this Indenture and the Sale and Servicing Agreement
in accordance with and within the time periods provided for herein
and therein.
 
19



(d) If the Issuer shall have
knowledge of the occurrence of an Event of Servicing Termination,
the Issuer shall promptly notify the Depositor, the Indenture
Trustee, the Rating Agencies and the Administrator in writing of
such event and shall specify in such notice the action, if any, the
Issuer is taking in respect of such default. If an Event of
Servicing Termination shall arise from the failure of the Servicer
to perform any of its duties or obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer
shall take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure.

(e) As promptly as possible after
the giving of notice of termination to the Servicer of the
Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to Section 8.1 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer may (subject to the
rights of the Indenture Trustee to direct such appointment pursuant
to Section 8.2 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement) appoint a
successor servicer (the “ Successor Servicer ”),
and such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a
written assumption in a form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee.
In the event that a Successor Servicer has not been appointed or
has not accepted its appointment at the time when the Servicer
ceases to act as Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, without further
action, shall be the successor to the Servicer in all respects in
accordance with Section 8.2 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement. The Indenture Trustee may resign as the Servicer by
giving written notice of such resignation to the Issuer and in such
event shall be released from such duties and obligations, such
release not to be effective until the date a new servicer enters
into a servicing agreement with the Issuer as provided below. Upon
delivery of any such notice to the Issuer, the Issuer shall obtain
a new servicer as the Successor Servicer under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement. Any Successor Servicer (other than the
Indenture Trustee) shall (i) be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of motor vehicle
installment sale contracts and (ii) enter into a servicing
agreement with the Issuer having substantially the same provisions
as the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to
the Servicer. If, within thirty (30) days after the delivery
of the notice referred to above, the Issuer shall not have obtained
such a new servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a Successor
Servicer. In connection with any such appointment, the Indenture
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such
successor as it and such successor shall agree, subject to the
limitations set forth below and in the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, and, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall enter into an agreement with
such successor for the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement
to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee).
If the Indenture Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s
duties as servicer of the Receivables as provided herein, it shall
do so in its individual capacity and not in its capacity as
Indenture Trustee and, accordingly, the provisions of Article VI
shall be inapplicable to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the Receivables. In
case the Indenture Trustee shall become successor to the Servicer
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to appoint as Servicer any one of its Affiliates;
provided , however , that the Indenture Trustee, in
its capacity as the Servicer, shall be fully liable for the actions
and omissions of such Affiliate in such capacity as Successor
Servicer. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture to
the contrary, in no event shall the Indenture Trustee be liable for
any servicing fee or for any differential in the amount of the
servicing fee paid under the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the
amount necessary to induce any Successor Servicer to act as
Successor Servicer under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.
 
20



(f) Upon any termination of the
Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to Section 8.1 of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall promptly notify
the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the Administrator and the
Rating Agencies in writing of such termination. Upon any
appointment of a Successor Servicer by the Issuer, the Issuer shall
promptly notify the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the
Administrator and the Rating Agencies in writing of such
appointment, specifying in such notice the name and address of such
Successor Servicer.

(g) The Issuer shall not waive
timely performance by the Depositor, the Seller or the Servicer of
their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents if
such waiver would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the interests of the Noteholders.

interest therein or the proceeds thereof (other than tax liens,
mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by operation of
law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and arising
solely as a result of an action or omission of the related Obligor)

as so directed (subject to Section 5.5):
 



 


(i)


institute
Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for
the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or under
this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration or
otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the
Issuer and any other obligor upon the Notes monies adjudged

(ii)


institute
Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial
foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Trust
Estate;

or more public or private sales called and conducted in any manner
permitted by law; provided , however , that the
Indenture Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust

such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate

the consent of such Holder.

Section 5.8 Restoration of
Rights and Remedies . If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or

Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

Section 5.9 Rights and
Remedies Cumulative . No right or remedy herein conferred upon

or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall
not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.

Trustee or any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing
upon any Default or Event of

such waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder,
respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereto. Upon any such waiver, such Default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to
have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be
deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every
purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture Trustee, the
filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay

any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture, and the Issuer (to the extent that
it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not hinder,

Notes . The Indenture Trustee’s right to seek and recover
judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected

the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment
by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any
execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust Estate

Indenture Trustee.

(a) If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall
exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and

prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of such Person’s own affairs.
 
40



(b) Except during the continuance of
an Event of Default:
 



 


(i)


the Indenture
Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as
are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against

(ii)


in the absence
of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively
rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the
opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished
to the Indenture Trustee and, if required by the terms of this
Indenture, conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;
provided , however , that the Indenture Trustee shall
examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not
they conform on their face to the requirements of this
Indenture.




(c) The Indenture Trustee may not be
relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except
that:
 



 


(i)


this paragraph
does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this
Section 6.1;



 



 


(ii)


the Indenture
Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the
Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
facts;

the Indenture
Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or
omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received

(f) No provision of this Indenture
shall require the Indenture Trustee to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of

powers hereunder if the Indenture Trustee shall have reasonable
grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or indemnity
satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not assured or
provided to it.

Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Indenture Trustee shall be subject to

Default, breach of a representation or warranty or other event or
(ii) written notice of such Event of Default, breach of a
representation or warranty or other event shall have been given to
the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this
Indenture; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, the

expressly provided in this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall
have no duty to take any action to determine whether any Event of
Default or other event has occurred.

obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or
indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without
limitation, strikes, work stoppages, acts of war or terrorism,
civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or

it being understood that the Indenture Trustee shall use reasonable
efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the
circumstances.

(k) The Indenture Trustee shall have
the right to decline to follow any investor direction if the
Indenture Trustee determines that the action or proceeding as
directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Indenture Trustee in
good faith determines that the action or proceeding so directed
would involve it in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial
to the non-directing holders.

(l) The Indenture Trustee shall not
have any obligation to investigate any matter or to exercise any
powers vested by the Indenture Trustee unless requested by 25% or
more of the Holders, and such Holders have assured to the Indenture

appointed with due care by it hereunder.

(d) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith
which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers;
provided , however , that such action or omission by
the Indenture Trustee does not constitute willful misconduct,
negligence or bad faith.

(e) The Indenture Trustee may
consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with
respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Notes
shall be full and complete authorization and protection from
liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or
opinion of such counsel.

(f) The Indenture Trustee shall be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested

satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction.

(g) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated

investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records
and premises of the Issuer, personally or by agent or
attorney.

Section 6.3 Individual
Rights of Indenture Trustee . The Indenture Trustee, in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee
of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates

co-paying agent hereunder may do the same with like
rights.
 
43



Section 6.4 Indenture
Trustee’s Disclaimer . The Indenture Trustee
(i) shall not be responsible for, and makes no representation
as to, the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes,
(ii) shall not be accountable for the Issuer’s use of
the proceeds from the Notes or responsible for any statement of the
Issuer in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection
with the sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the Indenture
Trustee’s certificate of authentication and (iii) shall
not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any other party,
including the Servicer, Seller and Depositor, and may assume each
other party’s performance of its obligations under the Trust
Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Sale and
Servicing Agreement absent written notice or actual knowledge of a
Responsible Officer to the contrary.

Section 6.5 Notice of
Defaults . If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and
if it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder and the

(90) days after it occurs. Except in the case of an Event of
Default described in Section 5.1(a)(i) or (ii) (including
payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such
Note), the Indenture Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long
as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines
that withholding the notice is in the interests of
Noteholders.

Section 6.6 Reports by
Indenture Trustee to Holders . The Indenture Trustee shall make
available, within a reasonable period of time after the end of each
calendar year, to each Person who at any time during such calendar

federal and State income tax returns.

Section 6.7 Compensation and
Indemnity .

(a) The Administrator, on behalf of
the Issuer, shall pay to the Indenture Trustee from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services. The Indenture
Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on
compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Administrator,
on behalf of the Issuer, shall reimburse the Indenture Trustee for
all expenses, advances and disbursements reasonably incurred or
made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the
compensation for its services; provided, however, that the
Administrator need not reimburse the Indenture Trustee for any
expense incurred through the Indenture Trustee’s willful
misconduct, negligence, or bad faith. Such expenses shall include
the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Indenture Trustee’s agents, counsel,
accountants and experts. The Administrator, on behalf of the
Issuer, shall indemnify the Indenture Trustee for, and hold it and
its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents,
harmless against, any and all loss, liability or expense (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs, and
any loss or expense incurred in connection with a successful
defense, in whole or in part, of any claim that the Indenture
Trustee breached its standard of care) incurred by it in connection
with the administration of this trust and the performance of its
duties hereunder; provided, however, that the Administrator need
not indemnify the Indenture Trustee for, or hold it harmless
against, any such loss, liability or
 
44


expense incurred through the Indenture
Trustee’s willful misconduct, negligence, or bad faith. The
Indenture Trustee shall notify the Issuer and the Administrator
promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Any failure
by the Indenture Trustee to so notify the Issuer and the
Administrator shall not, however, relieve the Administrator of its
obligations hereunder. The Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer,
shall defend any such claim. The Indenture Trustee may have
separate counsel in connection with the defense of any such claim,
and the Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, shall pay the fees
and expenses of such counsel. If the Indenture Trustee is then
acting as Administrator, all payment obligations to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be paid by
CarMax.

(b) The payment obligations to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee and the
discharge of this Indenture.

(c) When the Indenture Trustee
incurs fees or expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified
in Section 5.1(a)(v) or Section 5.1(a)(vi) with respect
to the Issuer, such fees and expenses are intended to constitute
expenses of administration under Title 11 of the United States Code
or any other applicable federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar law.

Section 6.8 Replacement of
Indenture Trustee.

(a) No resignation or removal of the
Indenture Trustee, and no appointment of a successor Indenture
Trustee, shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
Section 6.8. The Indenture Trustee may resign at any time by
providing the Issuer, the Administrator, the Depositor and the
Noteholders with at least 60 days’ advance written notice.
The Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 51% of the Note
Balance of the Controlling Class may remove the Indenture Trustee

the Issuer, the Administrator, the Depositor and the Rating
Agencies) of such removal and, following such removal, may appoint

Trustee fails to comply with Section 6.11;



 



 


(ii)


the Indenture
Trustee is adjudged to be bankrupt or insolvent;



 



 


(iii)

other public officer takes charge of the Indenture Trustee or its
property; or

Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.




(b) If the Indenture Trustee resigns
or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Indenture
Trustee for any reason (the Indenture Trustee in such event being
referred to herein as the retiring Indenture Trustee), the
Administrator shall promptly appoint a successor Indenture
Trustee.

(c) Any successor Indenture Trustee
shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the
retiring Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the Administrator and the
Depositor. Upon delivery of such written acceptance, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Indenture
 
45


Trustee shall become effective and the successor
Indenture Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of
the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Indenture
Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to the Noteholders.
The retiring Indenture Trustee shall promptly transfer all property
held by it as Indenture Trustee to the successor Indenture
Trustee.

(d) If a successor Indenture Trustee
does not take office within sixty (60) days after the retiring
Indenture Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Indenture
Trustee, the Issuer or the Holders of Notes evidencing not less
than 51% of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class may petition
any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Indenture Trustee. If the Indenture Trustee fails to
comply with Section 6.11, any Noteholder may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Indenture
Trustee and the appointment of a successor Indenture
Trustee.

(e) Notwithstanding the replacement
of the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.8, the
Administrator’s obligations under Section 6.7 shall
continue for the benefit of the retiring Indenture
Trustee.

Section 6.9 Successor
Indenture Trustee by Merger .

(a) If the Indenture Trustee
consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to another
corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or
transferee corporation or banking association without any further
act shall be the successor Indenture Trustee; provided ,
however , that such corporation or banking association must
be otherwise qualified and eligible under Section 6.11. The
Indenture Trustee shall provide the Rating Agencies, the
Administrator and the Depositor with prior written notice of any
such transaction.

(b) If at the time such successor or
successors by consolidation, merger or conversion to the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any
of the Notes shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any
such successor to the Indenture Trustee may adopt the certificate
of authentication of any predecessor trustee and deliver such Notes
so authenticated, and in case at that time any of the Notes shall
not have been authenticated, any such successor to the Indenture
Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the name of any
predecessor trustee or in the name of the successor to the
Indenture Trustee. In all such cases such certificates shall have
the full force which the Notes or this Indenture provide that the
certificate of the Indenture Trustee shall have.

Section 6.10 Appointment of
Co-Indenture Trustee or Separate Indenture Trustee.

(a) Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Indenture, at any time, for the purpose of
meeting any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which any part
of the Trust Estate may at the time be located, the Indenture
Trustee shall have the power and may execute and deliver an
instrument to appoint one or more Persons to act as a co-trustee or
co-trustees, jointly with the Indenture Trustee, or separate
trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust
Estate, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and
for the benefit of the Noteholders, such title to the Trust Estate,
or any part hereof, and, subject to the other provisions
 
46


of this Section 6.10, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Indenture Trustee may
consider necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or separate trustee
under this Indenture shall be required to meet the terms of
eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 6.11 and no
notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall be required under Section 6.8.

(b) Each separate trustee and
co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and
act subject to the following provisions and conditions:
 



 


(i)


all rights,
powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the
Indenture Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised
or performed by the Indenture Trustee and such separate trustee or
co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee
or co-trustee shall not be authorized to act separately without the
Indenture Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that
under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or
acts are to be performed the Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent
or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of
title to the Trust Estate or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such
separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the
Indenture Trustee;



 



 


(ii)


no trustee
under this Indenture shall be personally liable by reason of any
act or omission of any other trustee under this Indenture;
and



 



 


(iii)


the Indenture
Trustee may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any
separate trustee or co-trustee.




(c) Any notice, request or other
writing given to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to have been
given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees as
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this
Indenture and the conditions of this Article VI. Each separate
trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts
conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified
in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Indenture
Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all
the provisions of this Indenture, specifically including every
provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct of, affecting
the liability of, or affording protection to, the Indenture
Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Indenture
Trustee.

(d) Any separate trustee or
co-trustee may at any time constitute the Indenture Trustee its
agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the
extent permitted by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect
of this Indenture on its behalf and in its name. If any separate
trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign
or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and
trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Indenture Trustee, to
the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

10-D indicating that the Delinquency Trigger Event has occurred,
the Indenture Trustee will promptly request a vote of the

(the “ Asset Representations Review Notice ”),
which shall promptly provide such Asset Representations Review
Notice to the Seller, the Depositor and the Servicer.

(e) The Indenture Trustee shall
cooperate with the Asset Representations Reviewer in the event an
Asset Representations Review is commenced pursuant to
