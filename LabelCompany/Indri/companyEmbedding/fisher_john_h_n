Fisher� 
Control Valves - Most Reliable in the Process Control Industry
Control Valves are valves 
used in pipelines to control operating conditions such as flow, pressure, 
temperature, and liquid level by fully or partially opening or closing in 
response to a process signal. 


Sliding Stem Valves
Globe, angle, and 3-way valves offer a broad range--from DN15 to 600 (NPS 1/2 to 
24) low-flow valves to DN 500 (NPS 20) and larger for demanding high-pressure 
steam and hydrocarbon service.

Rotary 
Valves
When capacity and performance are the requirements rotary valves are the answer. 
Popular rotary products include butterfly, eccentric plug, full bore pipeline, 
high performance butterfly and segmented ball. 
 

Sanitary Valves
Sanitary valves are designed to meet the stringent demands of today's 
state-of-the-art Life Science facilities. 
 





Fisher� Digital Valve Controllers 


Digital valve controllers use microprocessors and have become the 
		dominant replacement technology for conventional and electro-pneumatic 
		positioners since the mid 1990s. Fisher� FIELDVUE� digital valve 
		controllers integrate functionality far beyond the traditional analog or 
		pneumatic positioner. The benefits of using a FIELDVUE digital valve 
		controller include: Availability of equipment alerts to notify the user 
		of pending issues, automated configuration, calibration and tuning , and 
		access to advanced levels of valve assembly diagnostics. This provides 
		consistent and predictable knowledge of valve assembly performance and 
		condition regardless who performs the task. 



Fisher� 
		FIELDVUE� ValveLink� Software 
		ValveLink Software allows you to streamline maintenance activities and 
		optimize process control operations. 



FOUNDATION� Fieldbus Communication
		FIELDVUE DVC6200f fieldbus digital valve controllers are approved for 
		non-incendive, intrinsic safety, flameproof and explosion proof 
		applications. 


HART� Communication Protocol
		FIELDVUE DVC6200 and DVC2000 digital valve controllers are HART 
		communication instruments approved for non-incendive, intrinsic safety, 
		flameproof and explosion proof applications. 
 


Fisher� 
		Positioners 
Positioners are most commonly used to move a control valve to a 
		specified position so that a process meets specific parameters (flow, 
		pressure, temperature). Fisher� positioners have the reputation of 
		providing the most accurate, robust, and reliable performance in the 
		industry.




Electro-Pneumatic Positioners
		Electromechanical positioners are conventional pneumatic positioners 
		that have an additional integrated electro-pneumatic transducer. 



Pneumatic Positioners
		Conventional pneumatic positioners receive a pneumatic control signal 
		and translate that into the appropriate pneumatic output signal to the 
		control valve actuator. 





Fisher� Field Instrumentation  


Fisher� field mounted instruments provide monitoring and control to 
		final control devices. Transducers, controllers, volume boosters, 
		solenoids and switches are used to monitor and control flow, 
		temperature, pressure and level variables in the process industry. 


Level 
		Sensors
		Fisher Level Sensors, in conjunction with either FIELDVUE DLC3000 Series 
		digital level controllers or 2500 Series controllers and transmitters, 
		are designed to measure changes. 



Level Switches
		On-off switch that senses high or low liquid levels. A displacer is used 
		as the sensor and is located in an external cage that mounts to the 
		outside of a vessel. 



Level Transmitters
		Both digital electronic and pneumatic displacement level controllers are 
		used for accurate level measurement or precision level loop control. 


Liquid Level Controller - Electric
		The electric on-off level controller is used to sense liquid level and 
		when used in conjuction with the Fisher� easy-Drive� electric actuator 
		form a fully electric level control loop which eliminates pneumatic 
		controller and dump valve venting. 


Liquid Level Controllers - Pneumatic
		The pneumatic level controllers sense the level of a liquid or a 
		liquid-to-liquid interface, compare the level with a desired value (set 
		point) and produce a pneumatic signal that can operate an actuator 
		control valve. 



Pneumatic Pressure Controllers
		Once again Emerson Process Management reinforces its long-standing 
		commitment to technological excellence with a complete line of pressure 
		controllers. 


Pneumatic Temperature Controllers
		Pneumatic temperature controllers compare process temperature with an 
		operator- adjusted set point. The controller delivers a pneumatic signal 
		to a control element. 



Valve Accessories
		Emerson Process Management manufactures a broad range of accessories for 
		use with control valves. 









Actuators 
An actuator is a mechanical device used to control a valve, damper, etc.
		



Pneumatic Actuators
		A pneumatic actuator provides high stem force output for demanding 
		service conditions. These actuators are usually air operated but some 
		can be self operated by the process fluid.


Electric Actuators
		An electric actuator provides a stem force output for a variety of 
		process applications by using electricity as the power source. 




Manual Actuators
		Fisher manual actuators are used in applications that require manual 
		positioning of valves. 
		










Fisher� Severe Service


		For decades Emerson�s severe service team has been providing global 
		customers with Fisher� severe service control valve solutions. Whether 
		it is severe service applications for the power, hydrocarbon, chemical 
		or pulp and paper industry, Emerson�s technical experts have provided 
		sound solutions to address critical applications for aerodynamic noise, 
		cavitation and out-gassing issues, as well as particulate erosion areas.


Aerodynamic 
		Noise Control
		Control valve technologies used to reduce the noise of compressible 
		flows via several techniques of frequency shifting, discreet pressure 
		staging, trim passage shape and/or adequate expansion areas. 



Cavitation Control
		Cavitation control trim constructions are designed to eliminate, or 
		minimize the damaging effects of cavitating applications. 




Engineered Solutions
		Complete valve solutions, custom engineered for the customer's specific 
		application. 



Steam Conditioning
		Steam Conditioning is the combination of pressure reduction and 
		temperature reduction of superheated steam to fit process needs and 
		protect downstream equipment  


		 


Fisher� 
		Nuclear Products 


Emerson offers a full array of Fisher� valve types in a variety of 
		construction materials, flow characteristics and end connections. 
		Complementary actuators and accessories are also available. Virtually 
		all Fisher valve products can be built to the ASME Section III 
		requirements.  For over 35 years, Emerson has supported nuclear 
		facilities, worldwide with Fisher� nuclear valves and associated 
		services. In fact, Fisher valves are installed in over 90% of the 
		world�s nuclear facilities. Thousands of ASME Section III N-Stamped and 
		RCCM process control valves have been shipped around the globe.

History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

Draper Fisher Jurvetson - Silicon Valley office

History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

John has provided each of these injured persons with the highest degree of legal representation. He is a lawyer of the highest caliber.More This review is from a person who hired this attorney. Hired attorney foreign object5.0 starsPosted by Bridget June  4, 2014John is extremely knowledgeable and precise with the work he does.  He is a terrific listener and attends to each question posed.  I specifically liked that he was available at off hours to discuss the case as needed.  John was easy to work with, even though my case was potentially going to be in a county two hours from his work place he gladly accepted my case.  Majority of the conferencing was through the mail and phone, however he was willing to travel if needed.  Most of the information discovered through my malpractice case was overwhelming and John was not one to rush me on decisions.  I like to think things through, ask more questions, then proceed.  John is a patient man and a wealth of information.   Mostly I liked his honesty with the possible outcomes, even if it wasn't what I was hoping to hear he was in fact providing accurate information.  If I ever need another lawyer I will certainly call Mr. John Fisher.More Motor vehicle accident. Spinal fussion.5.0 starsPosted by Stephen March 11, 2014John is a very caring individual whose main concern is his clients.  John worked on my case for almost 2 years. Not once was I left in the dark. John was very clear that I understood every aspect of my case and what was going on. John's dedication and commitment surpasses all others. I highly recommend  him for being an attorney that won't let you down. John's communication and honesty is a valuable asset.More See all reviews Attorney endorsements (22)Are you an attorney?

But when doctors, nurses, therapists, or dentists make them, the effects can last a lifetime. Patients have a right to expect that medical procedures will be properly performed. Medical malpractice attorneys represent you if you are injured by a healthcare provider's careless or accidental mistakes. For example, if a doctor leaves behind gauze in your body during surgery, resulting in an infected wound that requires even more surgery, the doctor committed medical malpractice. Medical malpractice attorneys can recognize injuries caused by mistakes; they know the most common mistakes that cause injuries, and they know how to find and present information useful to prove your case. Medical malpractice attorneys also know how much insurance is available if the health care provider is responsible for what happened to you.Medical malpractice lawyers in cities near Kingston, NYBeaconFishkillHudsonLagrangevilleMarlboroNew PaltzNewburghPleasant ValleyPoughkeepsieRed HookRhinebeckWappingers FallsSee all cities in New York Kingston, NY attorneys in related practice areasHealth Care Lawyers Kingston, NYPersonal Injury Lawyers Kingston, NYBrain Injury Lawyers Kingston, NYWrongful Death Attorneys Kingston, NYSee all practice areas Kingston, NY attorneys by top languagesSpanishSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave
