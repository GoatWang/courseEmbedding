Baytex is an oil and gas corporation based in Calgary, Alberta. The company, which first began operations in 1993, is engaged in the acquisition, development and production of crude oil and natural gas. Approximately 79% of Baytex's production is weighted toward crude oil and natural gas liquids.  Baytex's common shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BTE.   


Baytex continues to demonstrate superior capital and operational efficiencies as we prudently execute our strategy for long-term sustainability. Baytex's three key oil resource plays - the Eagle Ford in Texas, the Peace River Oil Sands and Lloydminster heavy oil - represent three of the highest rate of return projects in North America.

Baytex Energy Corp. is a Calgary-based[3] Canadian producer, developer and explorer of oil and natural gas. Formerly a trust, it converted to a corporation January 2011 because of government changes to tax incentives.[4] Through its subsidiaries, Baytex is "engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, exploiting and holding interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and related assets in Canada (in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan) and in the United States (in the states of North Dakota and Wyoming)."[5] Heavy oil makes up 67% of production and 70% of reserves. Assets in Alberta and British Columbia are within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Baytex was over 40%-owned by institutional investors in late 2013, including four of the big five Canadian banks and the Quebec Public Service Employees pension fund.[6]
For fiscal 2010 total production was 44,341 US bbl/d (5,287.2 m3/d, 53% from Alberta), 7% higher than the year before (with a high of over 45,015 US bbl/d (5,367.6 m3/d in the fourth quarter); for the year heavy oil made up 67% of production with the rest split between light oil and natural gas (16% each).[1] Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base.[4][7]
In 2011 Baytex acquired "heavy oil assets located in the Reno area of northern Alberta and the Lloydminster area of western Saskatchewan."[5]
By 2014 Baytex was producing about 26,000 US bbl/d (3,100 m3/d) at Seal near Peace River, 18,000 US bbl/d (2,100 m3/d) at Lloydminster and an anticipated 24,700 US bbl/d (2,950 m3/d) in Eagle Ford.[3][8]
In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited.[5]
In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56.[5]

History[edit]
Early on (1993–2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE in March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe.[9] Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively.[10]
In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource).[11][12]
In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%.
Super-heated tanks oil-processing tanks[edit]
Main article: Peace River oil sands
Several Peace River farming families have complained about "tar and solvent-like odours and emissions associated with heavy-crude operations across the region" after Baytex Energy began production. The Alberta Energy Regulator and Energy Minister Ken Hughes have publicly expressed concern about Baytex's conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by Baytex are out of the ordinary. Minister Ken Hughes told CBC News the Mar. 22nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by Baytex in the Reno field was "unprecedented." "What I could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of Alberta," Hughes said. "This kind of development was experiencing different emissions, and different air quality problems." [13]
The families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report "more than two years of health effects, including severe headaches and dizziness, sinus and other medical problems", according to their lawyer Keith Wilson. Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.[14] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America.[15] The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.[16] Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes.[17][18][19] There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production at a time when the Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.
From a purely market point of view, Baytex VP Brian Ector, notes their high capital efficiency, high rates of return projects has been successful for shareholders.[3][8]
Operations[edit]
There are 5 principal subsidiaries that the company operates through; Baytex Energy Ltd., Baytex Energy Partnership, Baytex Energy Oil & Gas Ltd and Baytex Energy (USA) Ltd.[20] 2P reserves totalled 197 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2009.[21]
Canadian Heavy Oil[22]

Alberta – Seal, Ardmore, Cold Lake, Lindbergh

Seal (63,000 acres undeveloped) – Oil sands property 100% owned through long term leases. 2009 production averaged 5,095 bbls/d.
Ardmore (39,000 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2002, produces about 2,100 bbls/d (includes 374 mcf natural gas).
Cold Lake (13,600 acres net undeveloped) – Oil production 476 bbls/d.
Lindbergh (21.25% owned) – not a significant producer (less than 600 bbls/d).


Saskatchewan – Lloydminster and Kerrobert

Templeflags (7,800 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2000, produced 4,238 bbls/d of oil (48.7%) and natural gas (51.3%).



Canadian Light and Medium Oil and Gas[23] (less than 290,000 acres of undeveloped land, produced at an average rate of 15,063 boe/d in 2009, 56.6% natural gas)

British Columbia (owned since December 2004) – in and around Stoddart. All of the oil is processed by Baytex owned batteries (oil makes up 49.4% of production), natural gas is processed initially at its own facilities before being treated at other sites in BC (not owned).
Alberta – in and around Bon Accorrd, Pembina as well as many small properties between there and Calgary (its corporate headquarters)

Bon Accord – part of the company since 1997, currently produces light oil and natural gas (in terms of barrels of oil equivalent light oil contributes twice as much as natural gas). Baytex has more recently (since 2009) utilized the method of horizontal well drilling to increase production.
Pembina (28,000 acres of net undeveloped land) – assets in the area were acquired in the summers of 2007 and 2008. Most of the extracted gas comes from the Nisku formation. Production is processed by facilities operated by the company and others run by other producers and refiners. Light oil and natural gas production are about the same, together they totaled 7,057 boe/d in 2009.


Saskatchewan – Dodsland, SE Saskatchewan. Its 34,500 net acres contain light oil. Drilling involves fractured horizontal wells.

United States

Many properties around Divide County, North Dakota

Canadian royalty trusts (CANROYs)[edit]
Penn West was one of a group of oil and gas producers which also included Advantage, ARC Energy, Baytex Energy, Bonavista Energy, Bonterra, Canadian Oil Sands, Crescent Point Energy, Daylight Resources, Enerplus Resources, Enterra, Fairborne Energy, Freehold Royalty, NAL Oil & Gas, Paramount, Pengrowth, Penn West Exploration, Peyto Energy, Progress Energy, Provident Energy, Trilogy, Vermillion Energy and Zargon Energy who did not pay "federal income taxes if they distributed their income to shareholders."[24][25]

"The resulting double-digit dividend yields grabbed dividend investors’ attention in the mid-2000s. Eventually the government cracked down and starting in 2011, trusts were required to pay the same taxes as regular corporations. Consequently, all trusts converted to corporations, and many cut their dividends."
— Harry Domash

On January 1, 2011, Penn West converted from a CANROY to a conventional corporation.[25]

Baytex Energy Corp. is a Calgary-based[3] Canadian producer, developer and explorer of oil and natural gas. Formerly a trust, it converted to a corporation January 2011 because of government changes to tax incentives.[4] Through its subsidiaries, Baytex is "engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, exploiting and holding interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and related assets in Canada (in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan) and in the United States (in the states of North Dakota and Wyoming)."[5] Heavy oil makes up 67% of production and 70% of reserves. Assets in Alberta and British Columbia are within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Baytex was over 40%-owned by institutional investors in late 2013, including four of the big five Canadian banks and the Quebec Public Service Employees pension fund.[6]
For fiscal 2010 total production was 44,341 US bbl/d (5,287.2 m3/d, 53% from Alberta), 7% higher than the year before (with a high of over 45,015 US bbl/d (5,367.6 m3/d in the fourth quarter); for the year heavy oil made up 67% of production with the rest split between light oil and natural gas (16% each).[1] Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base.[4][7]
In 2011 Baytex acquired "heavy oil assets located in the Reno area of northern Alberta and the Lloydminster area of western Saskatchewan."[5]
By 2014 Baytex was producing about 26,000 US bbl/d (3,100 m3/d) at Seal near Peace River, 18,000 US bbl/d (2,100 m3/d) at Lloydminster and an anticipated 24,700 US bbl/d (2,950 m3/d) in Eagle Ford.[3][8]
In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited.[5]
In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56.[5]

History[edit]
Early on (1993–2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE in March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe.[9] Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively.[10]
In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource).[11][12]
In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%.
Super-heated tanks oil-processing tanks[edit]
Main article: Peace River oil sands
Several Peace River farming families have complained about "tar and solvent-like odours and emissions associated with heavy-crude operations across the region" after Baytex Energy began production. The Alberta Energy Regulator and Energy Minister Ken Hughes have publicly expressed concern about Baytex's conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by Baytex are out of the ordinary. Minister Ken Hughes told CBC News the Mar. 22nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by Baytex in the Reno field was "unprecedented." "What I could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of Alberta," Hughes said. "This kind of development was experiencing different emissions, and different air quality problems." [13]
The families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report "more than two years of health effects, including severe headaches and dizziness, sinus and other medical problems", according to their lawyer Keith Wilson. Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.[14] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America.[15] The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.[16] Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes.[17][18][19] There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production at a time when the Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.
From a purely market point of view, Baytex VP Brian Ector, notes their high capital efficiency, high rates of return projects has been successful for shareholders.[3][8]
Operations[edit]
There are 5 principal subsidiaries that the company operates through; Baytex Energy Ltd., Baytex Energy Partnership, Baytex Energy Oil & Gas Ltd and Baytex Energy (USA) Ltd.[20] 2P reserves totalled 197 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2009.[21]
Canadian Heavy Oil[22]

Alberta – Seal, Ardmore, Cold Lake, Lindbergh

Seal (63,000 acres undeveloped) – Oil sands property 100% owned through long term leases. 2009 production averaged 5,095 bbls/d.
Ardmore (39,000 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2002, produces about 2,100 bbls/d (includes 374 mcf natural gas).
Cold Lake (13,600 acres net undeveloped) – Oil production 476 bbls/d.
Lindbergh (21.25% owned) – not a significant producer (less than 600 bbls/d).


Saskatchewan – Lloydminster and Kerrobert

Templeflags (7,800 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2000, produced 4,238 bbls/d of oil (48.7%) and natural gas (51.3%).



Canadian Light and Medium Oil and Gas[23] (less than 290,000 acres of undeveloped land, produced at an average rate of 15,063 boe/d in 2009, 56.6% natural gas)

British Columbia (owned since December 2004) – in and around Stoddart. All of the oil is processed by Baytex owned batteries (oil makes up 49.4% of production), natural gas is processed initially at its own facilities before being treated at other sites in BC (not owned).
Alberta – in and around Bon Accorrd, Pembina as well as many small properties between there and Calgary (its corporate headquarters)

Bon Accord – part of the company since 1997, currently produces light oil and natural gas (in terms of barrels of oil equivalent light oil contributes twice as much as natural gas). Baytex has more recently (since 2009) utilized the method of horizontal well drilling to increase production.
Pembina (28,000 acres of net undeveloped land) – assets in the area were acquired in the summers of 2007 and 2008. Most of the extracted gas comes from the Nisku formation. Production is processed by facilities operated by the company and others run by other producers and refiners. Light oil and natural gas production are about the same, together they totaled 7,057 boe/d in 2009.


Saskatchewan – Dodsland, SE Saskatchewan. Its 34,500 net acres contain light oil. Drilling involves fractured horizontal wells.

United States

Many properties around Divide County, North Dakota

Canadian royalty trusts (CANROYs)[edit]
Penn West was one of a group of oil and gas producers which also included Advantage, ARC Energy, Baytex Energy, Bonavista Energy, Bonterra, Canadian Oil Sands, Crescent Point Energy, Daylight Resources, Enerplus Resources, Enterra, Fairborne Energy, Freehold Royalty, NAL Oil & Gas, Paramount, Pengrowth, Penn West Exploration, Peyto Energy, Progress Energy, Provident Energy, Trilogy, Vermillion Energy and Zargon Energy who did not pay "federal income taxes if they distributed their income to shareholders."[24][25]

"The resulting double-digit dividend yields grabbed dividend investors’ attention in the mid-2000s. Eventually the government cracked down and starting in 2011, trusts were required to pay the same taxes as regular corporations. Consequently, all trusts converted to corporations, and many cut their dividends."
— Harry Domash

On January 1, 2011, Penn West converted from a CANROY to a conventional corporation.[25]

Baytex Energy Corp. is a Calgary-based[3] Canadian producer, developer and explorer of oil and natural gas. Formerly a trust, it converted to a corporation January 2011 because of government changes to tax incentives.[4] Through its subsidiaries, Baytex is "engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, exploiting and holding interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and related assets in Canada (in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan) and in the United States (in the states of North Dakota and Wyoming)."[5] Heavy oil makes up 67% of production and 70% of reserves. Assets in Alberta and British Columbia are within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Baytex was over 40%-owned by institutional investors in late 2013, including four of the big five Canadian banks and the Quebec Public Service Employees pension fund.[6]
For fiscal 2010 total production was 44,341 US bbl/d (5,287.2 m3/d, 53% from Alberta), 7% higher than the year before (with a high of over 45,015 US bbl/d (5,367.6 m3/d in the fourth quarter); for the year heavy oil made up 67% of production with the rest split between light oil and natural gas (16% each).[1] Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base.[4][7]
In 2011 Baytex acquired "heavy oil assets located in the Reno area of northern Alberta and the Lloydminster area of western Saskatchewan."[5]
By 2014 Baytex was producing about 26,000 US bbl/d (3,100 m3/d) at Seal near Peace River, 18,000 US bbl/d (2,100 m3/d) at Lloydminster and an anticipated 24,700 US bbl/d (2,950 m3/d) in Eagle Ford.[3][8]
In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited.[5]
In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56.[5]

History[edit]
Early on (1993–2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE in March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe.[9] Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively.[10]
In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource).[11][12]
In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%.
Super-heated tanks oil-processing tanks[edit]
Main article: Peace River oil sands
Several Peace River farming families have complained about "tar and solvent-like odours and emissions associated with heavy-crude operations across the region" after Baytex Energy began production. The Alberta Energy Regulator and Energy Minister Ken Hughes have publicly expressed concern about Baytex's conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by Baytex are out of the ordinary. Minister Ken Hughes told CBC News the Mar. 22nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by Baytex in the Reno field was "unprecedented." "What I could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of Alberta," Hughes said. "This kind of development was experiencing different emissions, and different air quality problems." [13]
The families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report "more than two years of health effects, including severe headaches and dizziness, sinus and other medical problems", according to their lawyer Keith Wilson. Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.[14] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America.[15] The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.[16] Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes.[17][18][19] There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production at a time when the Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.
From a purely market point of view, Baytex VP Brian Ector, notes their high capital efficiency, high rates of return projects has been successful for shareholders.[3][8]
Operations[edit]
There are 5 principal subsidiaries that the company operates through; Baytex Energy Ltd., Baytex Energy Partnership, Baytex Energy Oil & Gas Ltd and Baytex Energy (USA) Ltd.[20] 2P reserves totalled 197 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2009.[21]
Canadian Heavy Oil[22]

Alberta – Seal, Ardmore, Cold Lake, Lindbergh

Seal (63,000 acres undeveloped) – Oil sands property 100% owned through long term leases. 2009 production averaged 5,095 bbls/d.
Ardmore (39,000 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2002, produces about 2,100 bbls/d (includes 374 mcf natural gas).
Cold Lake (13,600 acres net undeveloped) – Oil production 476 bbls/d.
Lindbergh (21.25% owned) – not a significant producer (less than 600 bbls/d).


Saskatchewan – Lloydminster and Kerrobert

Templeflags (7,800 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2000, produced 4,238 bbls/d of oil (48.7%) and natural gas (51.3%).



Canadian Light and Medium Oil and Gas[23] (less than 290,000 acres of undeveloped land, produced at an average rate of 15,063 boe/d in 2009, 56.6% natural gas)

British Columbia (owned since December 2004) – in and around Stoddart. All of the oil is processed by Baytex owned batteries (oil makes up 49.4% of production), natural gas is processed initially at its own facilities before being treated at other sites in BC (not owned).
Alberta – in and around Bon Accorrd, Pembina as well as many small properties between there and Calgary (its corporate headquarters)

Bon Accord – part of the company since 1997, currently produces light oil and natural gas (in terms of barrels of oil equivalent light oil contributes twice as much as natural gas). Baytex has more recently (since 2009) utilized the method of horizontal well drilling to increase production.
Pembina (28,000 acres of net undeveloped land) – assets in the area were acquired in the summers of 2007 and 2008. Most of the extracted gas comes from the Nisku formation. Production is processed by facilities operated by the company and others run by other producers and refiners. Light oil and natural gas production are about the same, together they totaled 7,057 boe/d in 2009.


Saskatchewan – Dodsland, SE Saskatchewan. Its 34,500 net acres contain light oil. Drilling involves fractured horizontal wells.

United States

Many properties around Divide County, North Dakota

Canadian royalty trusts (CANROYs)[edit]
Penn West was one of a group of oil and gas producers which also included Advantage, ARC Energy, Baytex Energy, Bonavista Energy, Bonterra, Canadian Oil Sands, Crescent Point Energy, Daylight Resources, Enerplus Resources, Enterra, Fairborne Energy, Freehold Royalty, NAL Oil & Gas, Paramount, Pengrowth, Penn West Exploration, Peyto Energy, Progress Energy, Provident Energy, Trilogy, Vermillion Energy and Zargon Energy who did not pay "federal income taxes if they distributed their income to shareholders."[24][25]

"The resulting double-digit dividend yields grabbed dividend investors’ attention in the mid-2000s. Eventually the government cracked down and starting in 2011, trusts were required to pay the same taxes as regular corporations. Consequently, all trusts converted to corporations, and many cut their dividends."
— Harry Domash

On January 1, 2011, Penn West converted from a CANROY to a conventional corporation.[25]

Heavy Oil Value Chain

Home»Operations»Marketing»Heavy Oil Value Chain
Print Page 



   



At Baytex, we produce our heavy oil from vertical, slant and horizontal wells using progressive cavity pumps capable of handling large volumes of heavy oil combined with gas, water and sand. Initial production from these wells usually averages between 40 and 500 bbl/d of crude with gravities ranging from 11 to 18 degrees API. Once produced, the oil is trucked or pipelined for delivery to a sales pipeline or rail loading facility. 

Pipeline Sales

Prior to entering a sales pipeline, the heavy crude oil is usually blended with light-hydrocarbon diluents (such as condensate). At this point, the blended crude oil is sold by Baytex to various purchasers, and is delivered to markets in both Canada and the United States via pipeline. After reaching a refinery, the blended crude oil is refined into petroleum products such as fuel oil, lubricants, and asphalt by the crude purchasers. 

Crude by Rail

Baytex actively employs risk mitigation strategies to maximize the profitability of its heavy oil production. Beginning in 2012, our historic practice of hedging through fixed forward pricing contracts and long-term physical supply contracts was augmented through a significant increase in rail transportation, which allows us to deliver our heavy oil to higher netback markets and mitigate our exposure to pipeline access disruptions. One particular advantage of transporting heavy crude oil via rail is that we are able to ship raw undiluted barrels, which eliminates the need to purchase diluent. The raw heavy barrels are sold by Baytex at the rail loading facility to various purchasers, and then delivered to markets in the United States. After reaching a refinery, the raw heavy barrels are refined into petroleum products such as fuel oil, lubricants, and asphalt by the crude purchasers.

Baytex Energy - Risky, But Worth A Look - Baytex Energy Corp. (NYSE:BTE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Baytex Energy - Risky, But Worth A LookJul. 6.17 | About: Baytex Energy (BTE) Adam Mancini Commodities, oil & gas, gold & precious metals, macroSummaryBaytex offers combined product leverage, financial leverage, and undervaluation which means easy torque to a change in oil sentiment.
        I look at how Baytex will fare in a $40 average 2018 oil price environment and a (much more realistic) $53 price environment.
        The risk/reward ratio is favorable for a long entry.
        Recently, analysts at the Bank of Nova Scotia released a note on Baytex Energy Corp. (BTE) discussing their recent Q2 production figures pre-release, and the bank put a CAD$7.75 price target on Baytex. This represents an 158% return from current price levels. While I definitely view Scotiabank’s projection as optimistic, my own more conservative analysis for 2018 reveals that with a slightly improved and stabilized oil price, and given Baytex’s exceptional leverage to the price of oil, an 100% rally is reasonable from a valuation and historical price behavior standpoint. In fact, it isn’t unprecedented — between January 11th 2016 and June 7th 2016, Baytex rallied nearly 400% compared to a 60% rally in WTI. Conversely, the stock is down nearly 60% year-to-date compared to 13% for WTI. Over the past 6 months, Baytex is the 7th worst performer out of 41 Canadian energy names. The source of Baytex’s leverage to oil prices 

 The image above plots weekly Baytex prices in Canadian dollars against WTI. While the trendline only reveals a roughly 9 cent change in Baytex’s price for every dollar in WTI change, Baytex demonstrates massive variation in price for a given oil price, depending (generally) on the direction oil is trending at the time. The prices in the $7-$8 per share range when WTI was around $50 followed the oil rally in early 2016. The most recent pricing is evident in the red dot at the bottom, significantly below the trend-line. This is due to the general (although choppy) downtrend crude has been in since the start of 2017. At oil prices of $46 per barrel, Baytex prices have ranged between $3 and nearly $8 per share.
 A return of a general uptrend in oil would likely result in very positive Baytex performance thanks to its strong leverage to oil prices. Baytex possesses product leverage (due to its roughly 50% heavy oil production), financial leverage (near sector high debt-to-cash flow levels), and relative undervaluation. These three factors mean when oil is doing poorly, Baytex leads the pack, but the reverse will be true during rallies. Starting with financial leverage, Baytex current has a net debt of about $1.8 billion, and on a debt-to-cash flow basis using 2018 oil prices of $56 per barrel, Baytex has a debt-to-cash flow of 4.1. This compares to 2.1 for its peer group of junior and intermediate producers, and only Bellatrix (BXE) and Pengrowth (PGH) come in with worse debt metrics. The debt is largely due to a poorly timed acquisition of Aurora Oil and Gas in 2014, right before the oil price collapse. Baytex currently has annual interest payments equal to about 45% of cash flow, and this large fairly fixed expense results in strong cash flow leverage to rising (and falling) oil prices. This chart by TD Securities illustrates Baytex’s cashflow sensitivity in a scenario of oil falling by $10 per barrel. Similar upside sensitivity exists: 

 This leverage is also due to the fact Baytex produces about 50% heavy oil, which gives it product leverage due to the heavy oil differential to WTI. This means assuming a relatively constant differential, heavy oil weighted producers will see a greater percentage revenue growth for a set increase in WTI than light oil weighted producers. Examining two 2018 scenario’s for Baytex & the effect on price In this example, I am assuming WTI averages $53 for 2018, not an unreasonable forecast given outside OPEC, the only material source of production growth globally is U.S. shale, which breaks even at around $50.
 I am assuming a USD/CAD exchange rate of $1.33, a Western Canadian Select/WTI differential of US$11 per barrel and production of 71,000 boepd. The production mix is equivalent to current levels, and I assume minimal hedging losses/gains.   Product Realized Price (CDN) Total Annual Production in Relevant Units Revenue (CDN)   Heavy Oil $55.86 9,070,250 $506,664,165   Natural Gas $4.05 32,652,900,000 $132,244,245   NGL’s $17 3,109,800 $52,866,600   Light Oil $62.51 8,033,650 $502,183,461   Total   $1.193 Billion   Sources: Adam Mancini, Baytex Energy Corp. Financial Disclosures If this price outlook comes to fruition, Baytex is undervalued now. On an Enterprise Value/Debt-Adjusted Cash Flow basis (EV/DACF), this would put Baytex at about 5.1x. This compares to the company’s 3-year average of 7.1x debt-adjusted cash flow. Baytex’s peer group currently trades at 6.1x (but would trade much higher in a $53 per barrel average year). At $53, Baytex would generate around $1.2 billion in revenue as demonstrated in the above table. Assuming 67% cash expenses (including interest and in-line with previous years), Baytex would see about $394 million in cash flow, or $1.61 per share. If Baytex spends $350 million on capex (the high end of this year’s capital budget), Baytex would see free cash flow of $44 million. A move up to 7x 2018 EV/DACF (which would still leave Baytex at a discount to its peer group since the peer group average would also rise) would work out to a share price of CAD$6.91, this equates to a 138% return from July 5th prices of CAD$2.90. What about the downside? If we assume oil averages $40 in 2018 (an exceptionally unlikely and worst-case circumstance barring a recession — U.S. shale needs higher prices to satisfy demand growth), Baytex can expect cash flow of $217 million. If the company wound down capex to $300 million which is their sustaining capex level, this would leave an $83 million shortfall which would fall on Baytex’s roughly CAD$500 million of available credit room.
 $217 million of cash flow would give Baytex a 2018 EV/DACF of 8x. If we assume Baytex were to trade at 7x, this would result is a share price of CAD$1.66. This may be too pessimistic however — in 2016 Baytex bottomed at $1.55 when oil was $25 per barrel. Baytex is without a doubt highly risky. I am long, and since this is a fundamentals trade, I have no stop in place and am controlling risk by allocating only 9% of my portfolio. For investors who believe 2018 will see oil prices average at or above current levels, the risk/reward for Baytex is worth the trade.

Can Baytex Energy Corp Weather Another Market Downturn?
The Canadian oil company isn't in the position where it can handle another plunge in oil prices.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jun 15, 2017 at 1:30PM
            
            





After two challenging years, Baytex Energy (NYSE:BTE) was decidedly more optimistic heading into 2017. That's evident from its decision to boost capital spending nearly 50% this year, which would enable the company to restart its drilling activities in its home country of Canada and finally reverse its steady production decline. That said, the key to Baytex Energy's optimism was a belief that oil would average more than $50 per barrel, providing it with enough cash flow to finance its capex program so that it didn't drill itself any deeper into debt.
Unfortunately, rising oil output from Baytex Energy and its peers has put downward pressure on crude prices, which recently tumbled below $45 per barrel. It's a concerning price point for Baytex because the company isn't built to handle another market downturn. Because of that, the company might need to pull back the reins on spending, so its stock doesn't sink any further due to the weight of its debt.

Walking a tightrope
When Baytex Energy released its 2017 budget, the company anticipated that it could generate enough cash flow at $50 oil to finance between 300 million Canadian dollars and CA$350 million ($225 million-$265 million) in capital spending, which was enough capital to boost output 3%-4% by year's end. The company has since ratcheted up that growth rate to 5%-6% after reporting robust drilling results in the first quarter. However, the driller's better-than-expected production rates on new wells are both a blessing and a curse because it's contributing to the glut of oil on the market these days, which has been putting pressure on oil prices. 
That pricing pressure is a problem because at $45 oil, Baytex Energy would consume nearly CA$100 million ($75 million) more cash that it generates, meaning it might need to borrow money so it can bridge the gap. While the company does have more than CA$500 million ($376.5 million) available under its credit facility, it would be unwise for Baytex to tack any more debt on its balance sheet. That's because the oil company already has nearly CA$2 billion ($1.5 billion) in debt outstanding, which is way too much considering it's just a CA$3 billion ($2.26 billion) company. In fact, at its current run rate, Baytex's debt-to-funds from operations was nearly 6.0 times last quarter. For perspective, rival Crescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) only has CA$4 billion ($3 billion) in debt, and it's an CA$11 billion ($8.3 billion) company, which is why it has a much more conservative 1.8 times leverage ratio. 
Because of that lower leverage, Crescent Point Energy has the resources to grow production at a faster pace this year. The company currently expects to increase output 10% by year's end, which is a healthy growth rate for a company that's producing twice as much oil and gas as Baytex Energy. Furthermore, the company can finance that growth and pay its dividend while living within cash flow at $52 oil. Add to the fact that Crescent Point has a cash-rich balance sheet, and it has plenty of cushion should oil run below that level.

What this might mean for Baytex Energy
Baytex Energy, on the other hand, doesn't have any breathing room. Because of that, it might not have any choice but to cut back on capital spending. That's a tactic it employed last year when oil prices sold off, cutting its budget 33% below initial expectations in March and by another 13% in July. In addition to that, the company started shutting down older wells with weak economics to preserve cash flow. While oil prices haven't fallen low enough this year to require the shut-in of wells, it has dropped to the point where Baytex needs to think about revising its capex budget, with it potentially needing to narrow its range down closer to the CA$300 million ($225 million) mark. 
However, cutting spending still won't address Baytex Energy's troubled balance sheet. While the company doesn't have any near-term bond maturities, its credit facility will mature in two years. That's a concern because the company has already utilized a third of its capacity and is at risk of racking up more debt given its projected outspending at current oil prices. It's a situation that could cause the company problems down the road as this maturity date draws near, which is why the driller should consider tackling the issue before it gets out of hand.
That's exactly what happened to fellow Canadian producer Pengrowth Energy (NYSE:PGH), which previously eschewed asset sales, choosing to address its balance sheet woes by slashing spending and using that cash flow to pay down upcoming debt maturities. However, with the clock ticking away toward a doomsday deadline, Pengrowth Energy started unloading assets in recent months to stay afloat. Those transactions have enabled Pengrowth to reduce debt 60% since the end of last year, buying it more time to replace existing debt with less restrictive borrowings so that it can start developing the second phase of its promising Lindbergh project. That said, the company might have gotten more cash for its assets if it weren't pressured by the clock to get deals done, which is a lesson Baytex Energy needs to take to heart. 





Investor takeaway
As things stand right now, Baytex Energy can't handle another market downturn because the company has too much debt on its balance sheet to operate comfortably at current oil prices, let alone even lower prices. Because of that, Baytex will likely need to slash spending given that prices have fallen below its breakeven. Meanwhile, it should give serious thought to addressing its debt situation now by selling assets so that it doesn't face a potentially disastrous situation of having to unload assets into a collapsing oil market under a time constraint.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Baytex Energy Corp. is a Calgary-based[3] Canadian producer, developer and explorer of oil and natural gas. Formerly a trust, it converted to a corporation January 2011 because of government changes to tax incentives.[4] Through its subsidiaries, Baytex is "engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, exploiting and holding interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and related assets in Canada (in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan) and in the United States (in the states of North Dakota and Wyoming)."[5] Heavy oil makes up 67% of production and 70% of reserves. Assets in Alberta and British Columbia are within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Baytex was over 40%-owned by institutional investors in late 2013, including four of the big five Canadian banks and the Quebec Public Service Employees pension fund.[6]
For fiscal 2010 total production was 44,341 US bbl/d (5,287.2 m3/d, 53% from Alberta), 7% higher than the year before (with a high of over 45,015 US bbl/d (5,367.6 m3/d in the fourth quarter); for the year heavy oil made up 67% of production with the rest split between light oil and natural gas (16% each).[1] Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base.[4][7]
In 2011 Baytex acquired "heavy oil assets located in the Reno area of northern Alberta and the Lloydminster area of western Saskatchewan."[5]
By 2014 Baytex was producing about 26,000 US bbl/d (3,100 m3/d) at Seal near Peace River, 18,000 US bbl/d (2,100 m3/d) at Lloydminster and an anticipated 24,700 US bbl/d (2,950 m3/d) in Eagle Ford.[3][8]
In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited.[5]
In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56.[5]

History[edit]
Early on (1993–2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE in March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe.[9] Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively.[10]
In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource).[11][12]
In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%.
Super-heated tanks oil-processing tanks[edit]
Main article: Peace River oil sands
Several Peace River farming families have complained about "tar and solvent-like odours and emissions associated with heavy-crude operations across the region" after Baytex Energy began production. The Alberta Energy Regulator and Energy Minister Ken Hughes have publicly expressed concern about Baytex's conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by Baytex are out of the ordinary. Minister Ken Hughes told CBC News the Mar. 22nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by Baytex in the Reno field was "unprecedented." "What I could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of Alberta," Hughes said. "This kind of development was experiencing different emissions, and different air quality problems." [13]
The families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report "more than two years of health effects, including severe headaches and dizziness, sinus and other medical problems", according to their lawyer Keith Wilson. Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.[14] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America.[15] The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.[16] Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes.[17][18][19] There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production at a time when the Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.
From a purely market point of view, Baytex VP Brian Ector, notes their high capital efficiency, high rates of return projects has been successful for shareholders.[3][8]
Operations[edit]
There are 5 principal subsidiaries that the company operates through; Baytex Energy Ltd., Baytex Energy Partnership, Baytex Energy Oil & Gas Ltd and Baytex Energy (USA) Ltd.[20] 2P reserves totalled 197 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2009.[21]
Canadian Heavy Oil[22]

Alberta – Seal, Ardmore, Cold Lake, Lindbergh

Seal (63,000 acres undeveloped) – Oil sands property 100% owned through long term leases. 2009 production averaged 5,095 bbls/d.
Ardmore (39,000 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2002, produces about 2,100 bbls/d (includes 374 mcf natural gas).
Cold Lake (13,600 acres net undeveloped) – Oil production 476 bbls/d.
Lindbergh (21.25% owned) – not a significant producer (less than 600 bbls/d).


Saskatchewan – Lloydminster and Kerrobert

Templeflags (7,800 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2000, produced 4,238 bbls/d of oil (48.7%) and natural gas (51.3%).



Canadian Light and Medium Oil and Gas[23] (less than 290,000 acres of undeveloped land, produced at an average rate of 15,063 boe/d in 2009, 56.6% natural gas)

British Columbia (owned since December 2004) – in and around Stoddart. All of the oil is processed by Baytex owned batteries (oil makes up 49.4% of production), natural gas is processed initially at its own facilities before being treated at other sites in BC (not owned).
Alberta – in and around Bon Accorrd, Pembina as well as many small properties between there and Calgary (its corporate headquarters)

Bon Accord – part of the company since 1997, currently produces light oil and natural gas (in terms of barrels of oil equivalent light oil contributes twice as much as natural gas). Baytex has more recently (since 2009) utilized the method of horizontal well drilling to increase production.
Pembina (28,000 acres of net undeveloped land) – assets in the area were acquired in the summers of 2007 and 2008. Most of the extracted gas comes from the Nisku formation. Production is processed by facilities operated by the company and others run by other producers and refiners. Light oil and natural gas production are about the same, together they totaled 7,057 boe/d in 2009.


Saskatchewan – Dodsland, SE Saskatchewan. Its 34,500 net acres contain light oil. Drilling involves fractured horizontal wells.

Canadian royalty trusts (CANROYs)[edit]
Penn West was one of a group of oil and gas producers which also included Advantage, ARC Energy, Baytex Energy, Bonavista Energy, Bonterra, Canadian Oil Sands, Crescent Point Energy, Daylight Resources, Enerplus Resources, Enterra, Fairborne Energy, Freehold Royalty, NAL Oil & Gas, Paramount, Pengrowth, Penn West Exploration, Peyto Energy, Progress Energy, Provident Energy, Trilogy, Vermillion Energy and Zargon Energy who did not pay "federal income taxes if they distributed their income to shareholders."[24][25]

"The resulting double-digit dividend yields grabbed dividend investors’ attention in the mid-2000s. Eventually the government cracked down and starting in 2011, trusts were required to pay the same taxes as regular corporations. Consequently, all trusts converted to corporations, and many cut their dividends."
— Harry Domash

On January 1, 2011, Penn West converted from a CANROY to a conventional corporation.[25]

Baytex Energy Corp. is a Calgary-based[3] Canadian producer, developer and explorer of oil and natural gas. Formerly a trust, it converted to a corporation January 2011 because of government changes to tax incentives.[4] Through its subsidiaries, Baytex is "engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, exploiting and holding interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and related assets in Canada (in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan) and in the United States (in the states of North Dakota and Wyoming)."[5] Heavy oil makes up 67% of production and 70% of reserves. Assets in Alberta and British Columbia are within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Baytex was over 40%-owned by institutional investors in late 2013, including four of the big five Canadian banks and the Quebec Public Service Employees pension fund.[6]
For fiscal 2010 total production was 44,341 US bbl/d (5,287.2 m3/d, 53% from Alberta), 7% higher than the year before (with a high of over 45,015 US bbl/d (5,367.6 m3/d in the fourth quarter); for the year heavy oil made up 67% of production with the rest split between light oil and natural gas (16% each).[1] Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base.[4][7]
In 2011 Baytex acquired "heavy oil assets located in the Reno area of northern Alberta and the Lloydminster area of western Saskatchewan."[5]
By 2014 Baytex was producing about 26,000 US bbl/d (3,100 m3/d) at Seal near Peace River, 18,000 US bbl/d (2,100 m3/d) at Lloydminster and an anticipated 24,700 US bbl/d (2,950 m3/d) in Eagle Ford.[3][8]
In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited.[5]
In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56.[5]

History[edit]
Early on (1993–2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE in March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe.[9] Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively.[10]
In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource).[11][12]
In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%.
Super-heated tanks oil-processing tanks[edit]
Main article: Peace River oil sands
Several Peace River farming families have complained about "tar and solvent-like odours and emissions associated with heavy-crude operations across the region" after Baytex Energy began production. The Alberta Energy Regulator and Energy Minister Ken Hughes have publicly expressed concern about Baytex's conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by Baytex are out of the ordinary. Minister Ken Hughes told CBC News the Mar. 22nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by Baytex in the Reno field was "unprecedented." "What I could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of Alberta," Hughes said. "This kind of development was experiencing different emissions, and different air quality problems." [13]
The families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report "more than two years of health effects, including severe headaches and dizziness, sinus and other medical problems", according to their lawyer Keith Wilson. Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.[14] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America.[15] The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.[16] Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes.[17][18][19] There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production at a time when the Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.

Baytex Energy Corp. is a Calgary-based[3] Canadian producer, developer and explorer of oil and natural gas. Formerly a trust, it converted to a corporation January 2011 because of government changes to tax incentives.[4] Through its subsidiaries, Baytex is "engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, exploiting and holding interests in petroleum and natural gas properties and related assets in Canada (in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan) and in the United States (in the states of North Dakota and Wyoming)."[5] Heavy oil makes up 67% of production and 70% of reserves. Assets in Alberta and British Columbia are within the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Baytex was over 40%-owned by institutional investors in late 2013, including four of the big five Canadian banks and the Quebec Public Service Employees pension fund.[6]
For fiscal 2010 total production was 44,341 US bbl/d (5,287.2 m3/d, 53% from Alberta), 7% higher than the year before (with a high of over 45,015 US bbl/d (5,367.6 m3/d in the fourth quarter); for the year heavy oil made up 67% of production with the rest split between light oil and natural gas (16% each).[1] Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base.[4][7]
In 2011 Baytex acquired "heavy oil assets located in the Reno area of northern Alberta and the Lloydminster area of western Saskatchewan."[5]
By 2014 Baytex was producing about 26,000 US bbl/d (3,100 m3/d) at Seal near Peace River, 18,000 US bbl/d (2,100 m3/d) at Lloydminster and an anticipated 24,700 US bbl/d (2,950 m3/d) in Eagle Ford.[3][8]
In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited.[5]
In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56.[5]

History[edit]
Early on (1993–2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE in March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe.[9] Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively.[10]
In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource).[11][12]
In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%.
Super-heated tanks oil-processing tanks[edit]
Main article: Peace River oil sands
Several Peace River farming families have complained about "tar and solvent-like odours and emissions associated with heavy-crude operations across the region" after Baytex Energy began production. The Alberta Energy Regulator and Energy Minister Ken Hughes have publicly expressed concern about Baytex's conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by Baytex are out of the ordinary. Minister Ken Hughes told CBC News the Mar. 22nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by Baytex in the Reno field was "unprecedented." "What I could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of Alberta," Hughes said. "This kind of development was experiencing different emissions, and different air quality problems." [13]
The families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report "more than two years of health effects, including severe headaches and dizziness, sinus and other medical problems", according to their lawyer Keith Wilson. Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.[14] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America.[15] The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.[16] Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes.[17][18][19] There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production at a time when the Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.
From a purely market point of view, Baytex VP Brian Ector, notes their high capital efficiency, high rates of return projects has been successful for shareholders.[3][8]
Operations[edit]
There are 5 principal subsidiaries that the company operates through; Baytex Energy Ltd., Baytex Energy Partnership, Baytex Energy Oil & Gas Ltd and Baytex Energy (USA) Ltd.[20] 2P reserves totalled 197 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2009.[21]
Canadian Heavy Oil[22]

Alberta – Seal, Ardmore, Cold Lake, Lindbergh

Seal (63,000 acres undeveloped) – Oil sands property 100% owned through long term leases. 2009 production averaged 5,095 bbls/d.
Ardmore (39,000 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2002, produces about 2,100 bbls/d (includes 374 mcf natural gas).
Cold Lake (13,600 acres net undeveloped) – Oil production 476 bbls/d.
Lindbergh (21.25% owned) – not a significant producer (less than 600 bbls/d).


Saskatchewan – Lloydminster and Kerrobert

Templeflags (7,800 acres undeveloped) – owned since 2000, produced 4,238 bbls/d of oil (48.7%) and natural gas (51.3%).



Canadian Light and Medium Oil and Gas[23] (less than 290,000 acres of undeveloped land, produced at an average rate of 15,063 boe/d in 2009, 56.6% natural gas)

British Columbia (owned since December 2004) – in and around Stoddart. All of the oil is processed by Baytex owned batteries (oil makes up 49.4% of production), natural gas is processed initially at its own facilities before being treated at other sites in BC (not owned).
Alberta – in and around Bon Accorrd, Pembina as well as many small properties between there and Calgary (its corporate headquarters)

Bon Accord – part of the company since 1997, currently produces light oil and natural gas (in terms of barrels of oil equivalent light oil contributes twice as much as natural gas). Baytex has more recently (since 2009) utilized the method of horizontal well drilling to increase production.
Pembina (28,000 acres of net undeveloped land) – assets in the area were acquired in the summers of 2007 and 2008. Most of the extracted gas comes from the Nisku formation. Production is processed by facilities operated by the company and others run by other producers and refiners. Light oil and natural gas production are about the same, together they totaled 7,057 boe/d in 2009.


Saskatchewan – Dodsland, SE Saskatchewan. Its 34,500 net acres contain light oil. Drilling involves fractured horizontal wells.

United States

Many properties around Divide County, North Dakota

Canadian royalty trusts (CANROYs)[edit]
Penn West was one of a group of oil and gas producers which also included Advantage, ARC Energy, Baytex Energy, Bonavista Energy, Bonterra, Canadian Oil Sands, Crescent Point Energy, Daylight Resources, Enerplus Resources, Enterra, Fairborne Energy, Freehold Royalty, NAL Oil & Gas, Paramount, Pengrowth, Penn West Exploration, Peyto Energy, Progress Energy, Provident Energy, Trilogy, Vermillion Energy and Zargon Energy who did not pay "federal income taxes if they distributed their income to shareholders."[24][25]

"The resulting double-digit dividend yields grabbed dividend investors’ attention in the mid-2000s. Eventually the government cracked down and starting in 2011, trusts were required to pay the same taxes as regular corporations. Consequently, all trusts converted to corporations, and many cut their dividends."
— Harry Domash

On January 1, 2011, Penn West converted from a CANROY to a conventional corporation.[25]
