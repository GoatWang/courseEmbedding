  S. Marce Fuller                S. Marce Fuller              S. Marce Fuller S. Marce Fuller was recently         named president and chief executive officer of Southern Energy Inc., a         unit of Southern Company, one of the world's largest independent power         producers with assets of nearly $14 billion.      Fuller, 39, has been serving as executive vice         president of Southern Energy and president and CEO of affiliate Southern         Company Energy Marketing. She succeeds Tom Boren, who is retiring after         more than 30 years with Southern Company.      In her new role, Fuller will direct Southern         Energy's worldwide operations, which include electric power production,         delivery or trading facilities in the United States, Argentina, China,         the Philippines, the Bahamas, Chile, England, Germany, the Netherlands,         Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago.      "Marce Fuller's management expertise and         broad experience in our industry make her uniquely qualified to lead Southern         Energy's continued growth as one of the world's leading independent energy         companies," Dahlberg said. "She has been a key player in Southern         Energy's development and will provide the continuity we need as the company         moves forward."      "We have a great depth of talent in place         at Southern Energy, and that is helping us deliver on our strategy of         expanding our growth in the competitive energy supply business,"         Dahlberg added.      Fuller, who joined Southern Energy in 1992, had         overseen the operations of Southern Company Energy Marketing, a partnership         formed in 1997 by Southern Energy and Vastar Resources Inc. Southern Company         Energy Marketing provides energy trading, marketing and financial services         and other energy-related commodities, products and services to customers         in North America.      Previously, Fuller was Southern Energy's senior         vice president of the North American division, responsible for managing         the development and acquisition of power generation assets as well as         oversight of the management and operations of assets and business units         in North America.      From 1992 to 1994, Fuller served as international         project director, responsible for business development activities in Latin         America, the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand.

From Honey Dew, the UK’s best-selling organic beer, and pale ales like full-bodied Bengal Lancer and double-hopped Wild River to full-flavoured traditional ales like HSB and our rich, dark, award-winning London Porter, we brew beers of the finest quality to suit every discerning palate.
