               Company: Sinclair Broadcast Group , Inc.
Job Details
               Sinclair Oil Corporation has been helping western America drive with confidence for over 80 years. Formed from the assets of eleven small petroleum companies in 1916, Sinclair is one of the oldest continuous names in the oil business. The first corporate emblem, SINCO, was registered November 1, 1916. Sinclair began development of the apatosaurus (brontosaurus) in its advertising, sales promotions, and product labels in 1930. The apatosaurus was registered as a Sinclair trademark in 1932. An exhibit at the 1933 Chicago Worlds Fair highlighted dinosaurs and established Sinclair as the company that featured the apatosaurus. Again in 1964 at the New York City Worlds Fair, Sinclair proudly displayed an exhibit featuring nine life-sized dinosaurs highlighting its unique association with the age of the dinosaur--an age representative of the beginning of the formation of crude oil. The current Sinclair trademark is one of the most recognized company emblems in the United States.
