Grant Bennett Associates' 2017 Firm Management Retreat: Carmel, California





Grant Bennett Associates had its firm management retreat at the rustically, chic Mission Ranch Inn in the very picturesque city of Carmel.  The whole firm and a +1 were invited.

We spent two and a half days eating some great food and discussing our firm's unique culture and values. 


Here are some photos from our retreat.

Charities: Research, Presentation and Giving





This year for our last day of our firm's management retreat we focused a lot on charities and a little bit on public speaking. Local, world-wide, and everything in between; Dawn Brenner, our Managing Partner, thought up a wonderful idea to give each team member the opportunity to research a charity of their choice and present it to the rest of the firm.

2017


2016 Credits versus Deductions for Individuals and Businesses




When it comes to filing our taxes, we've all
heard of credits and deductions. But do you know what the difference is? 



- Deductions are subtracted from your income before you calculate the amount of
tax you owe. 



- Credits are subtracted from the amount of tax you owe.

Deductions for individuals can be related to work, investments, education, health care, and of course itemized and
miscellaneous deductions, some of which are property tax, charitable contributions, interest expense, moving expense, alimony, and disaster losses.

There are two types of tax credits: nonrefundable and refundable. 



- A
nonrefundable tax credit means you get a refund only up to the amount you owe
for taxes. 



- A refundable tax credit means you get a refund even if it is more
than what you owe. 



Credits for individuals can be related to family and dependents, health care, income and savings, education, and home ownership.

To read more about credits and deductions for individuals, check out this
informative IRS page. For information on credits and
deductions for businesses, read here.
