	Halozyme Therapeutics - Technology & Products - Product Candidates - PEGPH20




























































E-mail this page






Homepage»Technology & Products»Product Candidates»PEGPH20







Seeking Better Waysto Beat Cancer










Lead therapeutic candidate, PEGPH20, is based on Halozyme’s proprietary rHuPH20 enzyme. rHuPH20 is a recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme, which temporarily degrades hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars that accumulate around certain tumors. 
Preclinical studies have shown that removal of HA from tumors improves the ability of chemotherapies or immunotherapies to penetrate the tumor, inhibiting its growth. 
How Does It Work?
Certain cancers, including pancreatic, breast, lung, colon and prostate, have been shown to accumulate high levels of hyaluronan (HA). This accumulation creates a unique microenvironment that fosters the growth of tumor cells and generates barriers to drug delivery, inhibiting the potential effectiveness of many anti-cancer agents.
Breaking through the HA component of the tumor microenvironment opens previously constricted vessels, which may increase blood flow and access of co-administered therapies to the tumor.
Development History
Halozyme initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2009 to assess PEGPH20 over a range of doses and frequencies to assess the safety and tolerability of the treatment in patients with solid tumor malignancies refractory to prior therapies, which included patients with pancreatic cancer.
Today, Halozyme is conducting multiple clinical trials of PEGPH20 in patients with a range of previously treated or untreated solid tumor malignancies in combination with both chemotherapies and immunotherapies.


Key Events and Data Timeline for PEGPH20

In January 2017, Halozyme reported topline results from the combined analysis of Stages 1 and 2 and Stage 2 alone of its HALO-202 study as of December 2016. HALO-202 is a Phase 2 randomized, multi-center clinical trial of lead investigational drug PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in stage IV pancreas cancer patients. Among the findings, the primary endpoints were achieved, showing a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) for the efficacy evaluable population and by demonstrating a reduction in the rate of thromboembolic events in Stage 2 of the study in the PEGPH20 arm. 

The combined study population showed a statistically significant increase in PFS in the targeted HA-High patient population. Patients with high levels of hyaluronan (HA-High) treated with PEGPH20 plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine (PAG arm) when compared to HA-High patients receiving ABRAXANE and gemcitabine (AG arm) alone.
Stage 2 of the study, which completed enrollment in February 2016, showed a 91% improvement in median PFS for HA-High patients. PFS in the PAG arm was 8.6 months vs. 4.5 months in the AG arm, hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval of 0.63 (0.21, 1.93).
In Stage 2, the overall survival (OS), an exploratory endpoint, showed a 50% improvement in HA-High patients in the PAG arm was 11.7 months vs. 7.8 months in the AG arm, hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval of 0.52 (0.22, 1.23).




In June 2016, Halozyme announced results from a analysis as of February 2016 in 135 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were treated in Stage 1 of HALO 109-202, a Phase 2 clinical study of its investigational new drug PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine (PAG arm) as compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone (AG arm). This final analysis of Stage 1 secondary and exploratory endpoints was conducted using the Ventana companion diagnostic assay to retrospectively identify high levels of HA. The key results based on a February 2016 data cut-off showed in the HA-High patient population are as follows:

Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.2 months in the PAG arm vs. 6.0 months in the AG arm, hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval of 0.46 (0.15, 1.40);
Overall response rate (ORR) was 50%, including one complete response in the PAG arm vs. 33% and all partial responses in the AG arm;
Median duration of response was 8.1 months in the PAG arm vs. 3.7 months in the AG arm;
The exploratory analysis of median overall survival was similar between the treatment arms -- 11.8 months vs. 10.9 months in the PAG vs. AG arms, respectively. Factors potentially having an impact on these results include less aggressive disease among patients in the AG arm and a greater than 40% discontinuation rate of PEGPH20 treatment at the time of the clinical hold, resulting in all patients receiving AG alone in both arms;
The rate of thromboembolic events reduced from 43% to 9% in the PAG arm and from 25% to 6% in the AG arm with the introduction of prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) from Stage 1 to Stage 1 of the study.



In May 2015, Halozyme presented interim findings from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of its investigational new drug PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine for the potential treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The trial included 135 treated patients in Stage 1, of whom a total of 44 patients -- 23 receiving PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE and gemcitabine (PAG treatment arm) and 21 receiving ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone (AG treatment arm) -- had available biopsies that were determined in a retrospective analysis to have high levels of HA.


In December 2014, the European Commission, acting on the recommendation from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), designated PEGPH20 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.


In October 2014, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PEGPH20 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.


In August 2014, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer using PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine.


In September 2013 at the European Cancer Congress, Halozyme presented exploratory post-hoc analysis of progression-free survival and overall survival of a small subset of patients treated with PEGPH20 with available biopsy samples and HA scores in the Phase 1b study. Both progression-free survival and overall survival were longer in patients with high levels of tumor HA compared to patients with low levels of tumor HA. The observation that patients with tumors characterized by high levels of HA may respond better to PEGPH20 has resulted in our effort to develop a companion diagnostic to enable pre-selection of these patients.


In June 2013 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, Halozyme presented results from a Phase 1b clinical study of PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with stage IV metastatic pancreatic cancer (Phase 1b PEGPH20 Clinical Study). The study enrolled 28 patients with previously untreated stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Patients were treated with one of three doses of PEGPH20 (1.0, 1.6, and 3.0 µg/kg) twice weekly for three weeks, followed by no PEGPH20 treatment in Week 4 (in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 administered intravenously). In this study, the overall response rate (complete response + partial response) by RECIST 1.1 criteria was 42% (10 of 24 patients, 95% CI 22-62%) for those treated at therapeutic dose levels of PEGPH20 (1.6 and 3.0 µg /kg) as assessed by an independent radiology review.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Company history[edit]
Halozyme’s business is primarily focused on its proprietary and patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme, rHuPH20.[1] The company’s development pipeline is concentrated in clinical stage and pre-clinical stage oncology products, including its proprietary investigational drug, PEGPH20, a pegylated version of rHuPH20, which targets hyaluronan (HA) high tumors. The company is in various phases of clinical trials with PEGPH20 across multiple solid tumor types, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and gastric cancer, to test the drug’s safety and efficacy.[2] Halozyme has one FDA approved product (Hylenex recombinant, hyaluronidase human injection[3][4]). The company also licenses its drug delivery technology Enhanze[5] to other biopharmaceutical companies, including Roche, Baxalta, Pfizer, Janssen, AbbVie, and Lilly.[2]
Company leadership[edit]
Since January 2014, Dr. Helen I. Torley, M.B. Ch. B., M.R.C.P. has been Chief Executive Officer and President of Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. Prior to her role at Halozyme, she was Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and also served in senior level management positions at Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb. She began her career at Novartis in 1990 and spent 7 years there, with her final role as Vice President of Medical Affairs.[1]
Approved products[edit]
Hylenex: Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12/02/2005.[3] Hylenex is a hyaluronidase (human recombinant) injection indicated for use in subcutaneous fluid administration, dispersion and absorption of injected drugs, and subcutaneous urography.[6]
Technology[edit]
Enhanze: Uses recombinant human hyaluronidase to degrade HA and aids in the absorption and dispersion of co-administered injected drugs. Halozyme licenses its Enhanze drug delivery platform technology to other biopharmaceutical companies to enable intravenous to subcutaneous administration conversion and dose optimization.[7]
Product candidates[edit]
PEGPH20: A PEGylated drug candidate based on Halozyme’s proprietary rHuPH20 enzyme (a recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme).[8] It breaks down or depletes hyaluronan (HA),[9] which can build up in certain tumors. The goal of PEGPH20 is to break down HA so that some anti-cancer therapies and activated immune cells can better reach the cancer cells of HA-high tumors.[2][10]
Pipeline candidates[edit]
PEG-ADA2: An engineered human recombinant enzyme, adenosine deaminase 2, for decreasing the concentration of immune-suppressive adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, and PEGylated to prolong its circulation in the body. It has been tested in colon, lung, and pancreatic cancer models in preclinical studies.[11]
HTI-1511 Anti-EGFR ADC: An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a strong cytotoxin, monomethyl auristatin E, designed to treat EGFR-positive tumors, including those with KRAS and BRAF mutations. It has been tested in colon, lung, and cholangiocarcinoma models in preclinical studies.[11]
Clinical trial pipeline[edit]
Halozyme has many ongoing and completed clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of its primary investigational drug, PEGPH20, in combination with other therapies, with the goal of finding new treatments for pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and others.[1] As of October 2016, the company was sponsoring or collaborating on several clinical trials that were recruiting patients, including:

HALO Pancreatic 301 – A Phase 3 study to test the efficacy and safety of a combination of PEGPH20 with Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in participants with previously untreated HA-high stage IV pancreatic cancer.[12]
HALO Lung / Gastric 101 – A Phase 1b study to test the efficacy and safety of a combination of PEGPH20 and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in participants with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic NSCLC and relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.[13]
A Phase 1b study to test the efficacy and safety of a combination of PEGPH20 with Halaven (eribulin) in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, HA-high metastatic breast cancer (MBC).[14]

Company history[edit]
Halozyme’s business is primarily focused on its proprietary and patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme, rHuPH20.[1] The company’s development pipeline is concentrated in clinical stage and pre-clinical stage oncology products, including its proprietary investigational drug, PEGPH20, a pegylated version of rHuPH20, which targets hyaluronan (HA) high tumors. The company is in various phases of clinical trials with PEGPH20 across multiple solid tumor types, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and gastric cancer, to test the drug’s safety and efficacy.[2] Halozyme has one FDA approved product (Hylenex recombinant, hyaluronidase human injection[3][4]). The company also licenses its drug delivery technology Enhanze[5] to other biopharmaceutical companies, including Roche, Baxalta, Pfizer, Janssen, AbbVie, and Lilly.[2]
Company leadership[edit]
Since January 2014, Dr. Helen I. Torley, M.B. Ch. B., M.R.C.P. has been Chief Executive Officer and President of Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. Prior to her role at Halozyme, she was Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and also served in senior level management positions at Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb. She began her career at Novartis in 1990 and spent 7 years there, with her final role as Vice President of Medical Affairs.[1]
Approved products[edit]
Hylenex: Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12/02/2005.[3] Hylenex is a hyaluronidase (human recombinant) injection indicated for use in subcutaneous fluid administration, dispersion and absorption of injected drugs, and subcutaneous urography.[6]
Technology[edit]
Enhanze: Uses recombinant human hyaluronidase to degrade HA and aids in the absorption and dispersion of co-administered injected drugs. Halozyme licenses its Enhanze drug delivery platform technology to other biopharmaceutical companies to enable intravenous to subcutaneous administration conversion and dose optimization.[7]
Product candidates[edit]
PEGPH20: A PEGylated drug candidate based on Halozyme’s proprietary rHuPH20 enzyme (a recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme).[8] It breaks down or depletes hyaluronan (HA),[9] which can build up in certain tumors. The goal of PEGPH20 is to break down HA so that some anti-cancer therapies and activated immune cells can better reach the cancer cells of HA-high tumors.[2][10]
Pipeline candidates[edit]
PEG-ADA2: An engineered human recombinant enzyme, adenosine deaminase 2, for decreasing the concentration of immune-suppressive adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, and PEGylated to prolong its circulation in the body. It has been tested in colon, lung, and pancreatic cancer models in preclinical studies.[11]
HTI-1511 Anti-EGFR ADC: An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a strong cytotoxin, monomethyl auristatin E, designed to treat EGFR-positive tumors, including those with KRAS and BRAF mutations. It has been tested in colon, lung, and cholangiocarcinoma models in preclinical studies.[11]
Clinical trial pipeline[edit]
Halozyme has many ongoing and completed clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of its primary investigational drug, PEGPH20, in combination with other therapies, with the goal of finding new treatments for pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and others.[1] As of October 2016, the company was sponsoring or collaborating on several clinical trials that were recruiting patients, including:

HALO Pancreatic 301 – A Phase 3 study to test the efficacy and safety of a combination of PEGPH20 with Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in participants with previously untreated HA-high stage IV pancreatic cancer.[12]
HALO Lung / Gastric 101 – A Phase 1b study to test the efficacy and safety of a combination of PEGPH20 and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in participants with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic NSCLC and relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.[13]
A Phase 1b study to test the efficacy and safety of a combination of PEGPH20 with Halaven (eribulin) in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, HA-high metastatic breast cancer (MBC).[14]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
