	PROXY STATEMENT



	 



	 



	Our Board of
	Directors is sending you this proxy statement to ask for your vote as a Preformed Line Products Company shareholder on the matters to be voted on at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held at 660 Beta Drive, Mayfield Village, Ohio, 44143, on
	Tuesday, May 9, 2017, at 9:30 a.m., local time and at any adjournment of the meeting. We are mailing this proxy statement and the accompanying notice and proxy to you on or about March 24, 2017.



	Annual


	Report.

	A copy of our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 is enclosed with
	this proxy statement.



	Solicitation


	of


	Proxies

	. Our Board of Directors is making this solicitation of proxies and the
	Company will pay the cost of the solicitation. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, our employees may solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile or electronic mail.



	Proxies;


	Revocation


	of


	Proxies;


	Voting


	Instructions

	. If you are a shareholder of record, the shares
	represented by your signed and returned proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions as indicated on your proxy. In the absence of any such instructions, they will be voted to (a) elect the director nominees set forth under
	Election of Directors, (b) approve the compensation paid to the Companys Named Executive Officers (NEOs), (c) approve every three years regarding the frequency of an advisory shareholder vote on compensation of the
	Companys Named Executive Officers, and (d) ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as our independent registered accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Your presence at the annual meeting of
	shareholders, without more, will not revoke your proxy. However, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it has been exercised by signing and delivering a later-dated proxy or by giving notice to us in writing at our address indicated on the
	attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders by May 9, 2017, or in the open meeting.


	If you hold shares through an account with
	a bank or broker, banks and brokers have the authority to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions on certain routine matters. The ratification of the appointment of EY as the Companys independent registered
	public accounting firm is considered a routine matter for which banks and brokers may vote without specific instructions from their customers, but banks and brokers do not have the authority to vote for the election of directors, the compensation
	paid to the NEOs, or the frequency of an advisory shareholder vote on compensation of the Companys NEOs. As such, if you own your shares through a bank or broker and do not provide specific voting instructions to the bank or broker or do not
	obtain a proxy to vote those shares, then your shares will not be voted on these matters (broker

	non-votes).




	Voting


	Eligibility.

	Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date, March 10, 2017, are entitled
	to receive notice of the annual meeting of shareholders and to vote the common shares that they held on the record date at the meeting. On the record date, our voting securities outstanding consisted of 5,117,682 common shares, $2 par value, each of
	which is entitled to one vote at the meeting.



	Quorum

	. Shareholders, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the
	meeting, holding shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Company are necessary to constitute a quorum at the meeting. Abstaining votes and broker

	non-votes

	will be counted as
	present for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the meeting.







	Voting


	Required

	. The vote required to approve each proposal is as follows:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Director nominees who receive the greatest number of affirmative votes will be elected directors. Abstentions and broker

	non-votes

	will not be counted in favor of or against any
	nominee and, therefore, have no effect on this proposal.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Approval of the Compensation paid to the NEOs requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the common shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker

	non-votes

	will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Approval of the frequency of an advisory shareholder vote on the compensation of the Companys NEO will be based on the frequency selected by the highest number of votes cast. Abstentions and broker

	non-votes

	will have no effect on the proposal, since approval is based on the plurality of votes cast.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Approval of the proposal to ratify the selection of EY as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the common shares present in person or by proxy
	and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal. Banks or brokers holding shares for which no voting instructions were received may exercise their discretionary voting authority for
	this proposal.




	If any other matter properly comes before the meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote thereon in
	accordance with their judgment. We do not know of any other matter that will be presented for action at the meeting and we have not received any timely notice that any of our shareholders intend to present a proposal at the meeting. If any other
	matters are considered at the meeting, they would require for approval the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented at the meeting in person or by proxy.






	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS & MANAGEMENT



	The following table shows the amount of the Companys common shares beneficially owned as of March 10, 2017 by (a) the
	Companys directors, (b) each other person known by the Company to own beneficially 5% or more of the outstanding common shares, (c) the Companys named executive officers, and (d) the Companys executive officers and
	directors as a group. Except as noted below, the mailing address for each of the beneficial owners listed below is c/o Preformed Line Products Company, 660 Beta Drive, Mayfield Village, Ohio 44143.

	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE



	 


	 




	Code of Conduct




	The Company believes that high ethical standards are conducive to long-term performance, and as such, all Board members, officers and employees
	are subject to the Companys Code of Conduct, which is available on the Companys website

	www.preformed.com

	in the About Us section. The Company will disclose any waivers granted under the Code of Conduct that are
	required to be disclosed in such section of the website as well.




	Board Leadership




	The Companys leadership begins with the Board, where the Company has one individual, Robert G. Ruhlman, who serves as both Principal
	Executive Officer (President and Chief Executive Officer) and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Ruhlmans dual responsibility is appropriate given the Companys size and history. Mr. Ruhlman has led the Company for the past 12 years as
	both CEO and Chairman. As such, he has thorough, specialized knowledge regarding the strategic challenges and opportunities facing the Company. Mr. Ruhlman is supported by independent directors who play pivotal roles. The Board has no policy
	that requires the separation or combination of the CEO and Chairman roles, and may reconsider the leadership structure from time to time. Additionally, the Board does not have a lead independent director. Finally, the Board believes that the
	Boards role in risk oversight does not affect this leadership structure.




	Boards Role in Risk Oversight




	The Company believes taking measured and informed risks is an important element of its strategy. The Board maintains an active role in the
	Companys risk oversight to identify and mitigate broader systematic risks. All material transactions and decisions are presented to the Board, and the Board engages in active discussions, challenging management while using its experiences to
	improve the Company. The Board has a depth of risk management experience, including one Board member with over 30 years of experience as an insurance broker. The Board members frequently have discussions with members of management outside of the
	meetings and have the authority to call on experts where appropriate. Additionally, in accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and the Companys independent auditor, the
	Companys (i) significant exposures (whether financial, operating or otherwise), and (ii) risk assessment and risk management policies. The Compensation Committee monitors the risks that may be created through the Companys
	compensation programs.

	Board Composition




	In accordance with our Amended and Restated Code of Regulations, the number of directors has been fixed at eight. The Board of Directors is
	classified into two classes composed of four members each, with both classes serving staggered

	two-year

	terms. Below is an overview of each current Board member including a description of the particular
	experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills of the directors that led to the conclusion that each should serve as a director. Mr. Matthew Frymier, Mr. Richard Gascoigne, Ms. Maegan Ruhlman and Mr. Robert Ruhlman are

	1997 through June 2007. Mr. Corletts tenure at Ohio Universitys Business School has given him the necessary credentials to be a contributing member of the Board, not only from an accounting aspect, but also in general business
	management. Mr. Corlett has lectured and written on accounting, auditing and executive compensation. Mr. Corletts zest for understanding the Companys financial statements, while providing sound business advice, keeps him in a
	close working relationship with senior management. In addition, his oversight experience facilitates his role in reviewing the Companys compensation policy and ensuring that management is compensated in a manner consistent with the
	compensation policy and in accordance with the relevant laws as Chairman of the Compensation Committee.

	co-founded

	Corrum Capital Management, LLC, an alternative asset management firm in San Francisco, California and Charlotte, North Carolina, in
	December 2013, where he currently serves as Senior Advisor. Mr. Frymiers extensive prior board experience has honed his ability to exercise independent judgment and engage in strategic decision making. In addition, he currently serves as

	during his career at Marsh, including two years as regional compliance officer. He has extensive experience in commercial property and casualty underwriting, specifically focusing on middle market companies. In addition, he has provided risk
	management consulting to clients during product development, acquisitions and market introductions. The Company values his strong risk management and compliance experience. He is skilled at monitoring the Companys implementation of and
	adherence to its policies. His thoughtfulness in decision-making coupled with his willingness to thoroughly discuss issues make him a fitting member of the Board, as well as the Compensation and Audit Committees.



	Michael


	E.


	Gibbons

	 Mr. Gibbons began his career with McDonald & Company, where he quickly rose to
	the level of general partner and then senior vice president. From there, he became president and CEO of a leading regional securities and investment banking firm in Houston, Texas. Soon after that, he founded Brown Gibbons Lang & Company,
	where he provides an active senior role to client engagements and business development opportunities. He knows how to provide workable solutions to the Company. From his leadership of an investment bank, he is well suited to provide counsel on
	trends in the debt and equity markets, the integrity of the financial statements and the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm. This business acumen and experience ensures that he is well suited not only as a member of the
	Board, but also as the Chairman of the Audit Committee and a member of the Compensation Committee.

	PROPOSAL ONE: Election of Directors



	 


	In August 2016, Mrs. Barbara

	Board Committees and Meetings



	 




	Nominating Committee




	The Board does not have a Nominating Committee nor any charter with respect to nominations. However, pursuant to NASDAQ corporate governance
	rules, any Board nominees must be recommended for Board selection by a majority of the Companys independent directors. The independent directors are responsible for ensuring that the members of the Board of Directors possess a variety of
	knowledge, experience and capabilities derived from substantial business and professional experience, based on an assessment of numerous factors such as age and understanding of and experience in manufacturing, technology, finance and marketing. The
	Board considers whether potential candidates will satisfy the independent standards for the Board, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Additionally, nominees for the Board of Directors should be committed to enhancing long-term shareholder
	value and must possess a high level of personal and professional ethics, sound business judgment and integrity. Finally, the Board welcomes nominees with diverse backgrounds, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in particular experience such
	as banking, international business, government, and health care. To this end, the independent directors rely on their networks of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, and may also consider qualified candidates suggested by officers,
	employees, shareholders and others, using the same criteria to evaluate all candidates. Matt Frymier and Maegan Ruhlman were recommended for consideration by the independent directors for nomination for election to the Board by Robert G. Ruhlman,
	the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. While the Board considers diversity in its evaluation of candidates, the Board does not have a policy specifically focused on the consideration of diversity.


	The independent directors will also consider nominees for election to the Board from shareholders. To recommend a prospective nominee, submit
	the candidates name and qualifications to Caroline Vaccariello, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, in writing to the following address: 660 Beta Drive, Mayfield Village, Ohio, 44143.

	Audit Committee




	The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee, comprised of Messrs. Gibbons (chairman), Corlett, Frymier and Gascoigne, each of whom
	qualifies as independent for audit committee purposes under the NASDAQ rules. The Board of Directors has determined that Michael E. Gibbons is an audit committee financial expert and that each member meets the requirements under the NASDAQ rules
	regarding the ability to read and understand financial statements.


	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board of
	Directors in fulfilling its responsibility relating to corporate accounting, reporting practices of the Company, and the quality and integrity of the financial reports and other financial information provided by the Company to NASDAQ, the Securities
	and Exchange Commission or the public. The Audit Committee also engages the independent registered public accountants for the Company, reviews with the independent registered public accountants the plans and results of audit engagements, preapproves

	www.preformed.com

	.




	Compensation Committee




	The Board
	of Directors has appointed a Compensation Committee, comprised of Messrs. Corlett (chairman), Frymier, Gascoigne and Gibbons, each of whom qualifies as independent under the NASDAQ rules. The Compensation Committee administers the Companys
	executive compensation program and as such, is responsible for reviewing all aspects of the compensation program for the Companys executive officers. The Compensation Committee meets at scheduled times during the year  no less than twice
	 and has the authority to consider and take action by written consent. The Compensation Committee Chairman reports on Compensation Committee actions and recommendations at the Companys Board meetings. In order to meet its
	responsibilities, the Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate certain of its responsibilities to subcommittees and/or officers where necessary and consistent with applicable law and to retain consultants. The Compensation Committee is
	governed by a written charter, which is available on the Companys website

	www.preformed.com

	key officers and managers, and align their compensation with the Companys overall business strategies, values, and performance. To this end, the Compensation Committee has established, and the Board of Directors has endorsed, an executive
	compensation philosophy to compensate executive officers based on their responsibilities and the Companys overall annual and long-term performance, which is outlined under Directors and Executive Officers Compensation.




	Meetings




	In 2016, the Board of
	Directors held six meetings. In 2016, the Audit Committee held four meetings and the Compensation Committee held five meetings. All of the directors attended at least 75% of the total of meetings held by the Board of Directors and all committees on
	which the director served. The directors are expected to attend the Companys annual meeting of shareholders. All of the directors who were Board members at that time attended last years annual meeting of shareholders.






	Audit Committee Report



	 


	In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility relating to corporate
	accounting, reporting practices of the Company, and the quality and integrity of the financial reports and other financial information provided by the Company to NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the public. Management is responsible
	for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The independent registered public accountants are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with
	generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee is comprised of four directors who are not officers or employees of the Company and are independent under the current NASDAQ rules.

	In discharging its oversight responsibility as to the audit process, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed
	the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016, with the Companys management. The Audit committee reviewed with the independent auditor, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the
	conformity of those audited consolidated financial statements and related schedule with US generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Companys accounting principles and such
	other matters as are required to be discussed with the Committee by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, the
	rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other applicable regulations. In addition, the Committee has discussed with the independent auditor the firms independence from the Company management and the Company, including the matters
	in the letter from the firm required by PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and considered the compatibility of

	non-audit

	services with the independent auditors
	independence.


	Based on the above-referenced review and discussions with management and the independent auditors, the Audit Committee
	recommended to the Board of Directors that the Companys audited financial statements and managements assessment of effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting be included in its Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for the year ended December 31, 2016, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	COMPENSATION POLICIES AND RISK



	The Companys policies and overall actual compensation practices for all employees do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have
	a material adverse effect on the Company. Generally speaking, the compensation policies are consistent for all business units of the Company. Additionally, incentives are not designed to, and do not, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a
	material adverse effect on the Company as the incentives generally reward growth and profitability. The Companys various bonus programs are based on consistent growth of the Company, relying, for example, on the total return on investment, or
	including language that requires any increases in sales to be on appropriate and consistent margins. As such, they do not encourage employees to take risks in order to receive incentive compensation, nor are they reasonably likely to have a material
	adverse effect on the Company.

	DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COMPENSATION




	Compensation Discussion and Analysis



	 



	Role of the Compensation Committee



	The
	Compensation Committee (the Committee) administers the Companys executive compensation programs. The Committees primary role is to oversee the Companys compensation and benefit plans and policies for its elected
	executive officers, including the executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table below (Named Executive Officers or NEOs) who are the Companys principal executive officer (Robert G. Ruhlman, Chairman,
	President and Chief Executive Officer), principal financial officer (Eric R. Graef, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President  Finance) and the three other most highly compensated executive officers. The Committee reviews and approves all
	executive compensation decisions relating to the officers, including all NEOs.


	In the performance of its duties, the Committee has the
	authority to allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members, and may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to a committee formed for that purpose, subject to approval from
	the entire Board. Additionally, the Committee may select and appoint outside consultants to assist it.



	Philosophy of the Compensation Program



	The philosophy of the Committee is to provide a compensation program that will attract, motivate and retain key members of the leadership team
	in order to give the Company a competitive advantage while ensuring the success and growth of the Company. The compensation program should ensure that a significant portion of compensation will be directly related to the Companys performance
	by tying annual cash bonus and long-term incentive awards to Company performance. The compensation program is intended to motivate the officers to enable the Company to achieve its short-term and long-term business goals. The Committee has three
	goals to guide it in this endeavor: (a) compensation paid to officers should be aligned with the performance of the Company on both a long- and short-term basis; (b) compensation should be competitive within the employment environment; and
	(c) compensation should be designed to reward officers for meeting performance targets.



	Compensation Program



	The Committee strives to craft a compensation program that pays the officers at competitive levels reflective of their individual
	responsibilities while maintaining consistency and pay equity among the individual officers. The Committee conducts an annual review of the compensation program, as well as changes in the overall composition of the management team and the
	responsibilities of the individual officers, to ensure that the compensation is competitive within the market, supports retention objectives and is internally equitable. Reliance upon various tools, and the findings from such tools, assists the
	Committee in its analysis, and leads to decisions regarding the mix of the various compensation elements to be included. Additionally, the cost of the compensation program is considered, in recognition that the optimal compensation program motivates
	employees to improve Company results on a cost-effective basis. Typically, the Committee finalizes compensation elements for a calendar year in December of the prior year.



	Tools


	and


	Findings


	from


	Analysis

	. The Committee relies upon tools to analyze the compensation program
	internally and within the competitive landscape. Historically, these tools have been outside data compiled by various consultants, tally sheets detailing overall compensation packages for each individual officer and discussions with the CEO
	regarding performance levels and goals. The Committee also considers the results of the most recent

	non-binding

	advisory say on pay vote of the Companys shareholders on executive
	compensation.



	Consultant.

	The Committee has the authority to retain its own advisor. For 2016, the Committee did not retain an
	advisor.


	 


	13







	External


	Data

	. The Committee generally relies upon various independent surveys,
	which are matched to specific positions with similar functional descriptions as those for the officers. The Committee reviews surveys primarily to gain perspective on how the Companys executive compensation compares to other

	similarly-sized

	companies so that it can assess whether the Companys pay levels are generally competitive and represent a reward for strong performance. For 2016, the Committee utilized the TowersWatson annual
	compensation level survey. Using this independent survey, the Committee analyzed the compensation paid to officers, including the CEO, compared against the compensation paid to executives holding equivalent positions in the peer classification
	group, consisting of surveyed manufacturers of durable goods with employment levels of between 1,000 and 4,999 (the Peer Group). The survey did not include any revenue limitations as using such limitations would have resulted in a peer
	group that was too small to be statistically relevant. The Committee reviews base salary and total compensation at both the 50

	th

	and 75

	th

	percentile levels to highlight where the Companys compensation is relative to peers for competitive purposes, and takes into account the individuals experience and performance and the Companys results. For 2016, the officers
	including the CEO were near the 50

	th

	percentile, when reviewing base salary alone. The Committee decided that salary levels that are near the
	50

	th

	percentile were appropriate for 2016, given the sales and operating income levels achieved by the Company.


	The Committee also reviews total cash compensation, which included salary and the maximum available bonus for the officers, and compares that
	data with the Peer Group data. The Committee does not engage in specific benchmarking when comparing total compensation because a significant portion is tied to the Companys performance, which can cause a great variation relative to the
	amounts paid by comparable companies with different performance results. As a result, the Committee considers the total compensation paid by other companies to ensure that the Companys pay is competitive, and to assess whether its payout
	levels for strong performance represents an incentive to achieve such performance. For 2016, total compensation of the officers was found to align near the 50

	th

	percentile depending on the actual
	payout to be achieved.



	Discussions


	with


	the


	CEO.

	All of the

	non-CEO

	officers report directly to the CEO, who performs a yearly evaluation of the performance of each officer. The CEOs assessment of the individual performance forms the basis for the proposed compensation levels of each officer (other than the
	CEO), in light of the information derived from the aforementioned survey. The CEO provides a written evaluation for each officer (other than the CEO) that includes his recommendations for salary adjustments for the subsequent year to the Committee,
	which weighs these recommendations in determining salary levels.



	Results


	of


	2014


	Say


	on


	Pay


	Vote

	. The Proxy Statement filed by the Company in 2014 included a

	non-binding

	advisory say on pay vote on executive compensation. Although the vote was

	non-binding,

	the Board of Directors and the Committee value the opinions of the shareholders and considered the outcome of the vote when making 2016 compensation decisions for the Companys NEOs. The
	Companys compensation program received an affirmative vote from over 87% of the Companys common shares entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy at the 2014 annual meeting. The Company views this shareholder approval as an
	endorsement of a sound compensation program. The Companys shareholders are being asked to cast a

	non-binding

	advisory


	say-on-pay


	vote on executive compensation at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. See Proposal Two: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation.



	Compensation


	Elements

	. The Company recognizes that its success depends, in large part, on a leadership team with the skills
	and commitment necessary to successfully manage a global organization. The compensation program assists in achieving this objective by relying on the elements of compensation detailed below. Certain elements are designed to enable the Company to
	attract and retain the officers with the skills to anticipate and respond to the market, while other elements are intended to motivate the officers to achieve financial results to enhance shareholder value. The Companys 2016 compensation
	program for officers consisted of the following elements:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Base salaries;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Annual cash incentive awards;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Long-term equity grants;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Retirement benefits; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Health and welfare benefits.




	 


	 


	14






	The Company structures the total compensation program so that its reliance on any particular
	element of compensation is flexible. Thus, the compensation program strives to meet the goals outlined above, by balancing short-term (i.e., base salaries, annual cash incentive awards) and long-term incentives (i.e., long-term equity grants),
	competitively in the market and to address the volatility in the Companys performance due to external factors. There is no difference in the policies and their application for each of the officers, except for the CEO.



	Base


	Salaries

	. The Companys goal is to establish salaries at a level sufficient to attract and retain talented executives.
	This goal is based on the Companys belief that it is important to maintain salary levels near a midpoint of comparable company executives to be competitive within the general market and the Peer Group. The base salaries of the officers are
	reviewed annually. In each case, factors considered in establishing an officers salary level include a review of the individuals performance initiated by the CEO, an accounting of the Companys performance, the experience level for
	the position, the Peer Group executive compensation information derived from the independent compensation survey using companies in similar industries and with similar employee levels and internal equity. For 2016, the Committee ratified the
	CEOs recommendations for no increases for either the officers or the CEO, in light of the Companys performance and a return to a

	bi-annual

	salary review for the officers.



	Annual


	Cash


	Incentive


	Awards

	. The annual cash incentive award is designed to motivate and reward the officers for
	their contributions to the Companys performance by making a significant portion of their total compensation variable and dependent upon the Companys annual financial performance. It is tied directly to the financial performance of the
	Company on a sliding scale of return on shareholders equity. The Committee believes that compensating management by aligning compensation with shareholders return on their investment is an effective way to connect the achievement of
	performance goals and to encourage growth in the Company while rewarding officers for their contributions. The calculation is based on the Companys

	pre-tax

	return on equity and assessed over a range of
	3% to 11%. The implied target is 7% which assumes a linear, symmetrical bonus curve with

	one-half

	of the maximum bonus earned at the midpoint of the performance range. From this calculation, the awards are
	determined based on a schedule that provides certain percentages to be applied to base salaries. The Companys

	pre-tax

	return on shareholders equity for 2016 was 9.2%, which would have resulted in a
	payout of 76% for the CEO and 65% for the other NEOs. The maximum bonuses are 100% of salary for the CEO and 85% of salary for the other officers. The Committee has the ability to exercise discretion and make adjustments and, in reviewing the 2016
	payout amounts, the Committee recognized the extraordinary effort of the management team during difficult economic conditions for the Companys industry. Because the Companys customers are primarily governments or governmental-regulated
	entities, the economic woes facing the majority of governments in the last few years have forced most of the customers to curtail capital expenditures. As such, capital expenditures at public utilities around the world have slowed precipitously. Due
	to these significant variations in market demand, the Committee believed that the management team should receive a greater bonus at lower levels of return on shareholders equity to also compensate them for achievements with respect to market
	share and volume-related expense management. The Committee approved an adjustment of the annual cash bonus award so that the cash incentive awards for 2016 were 88% of salary for the CEO and 75% of salary for the other NEOs.



	Long-term


	Equity


	Grants

	. The Committee has the discretion under the Companys equity award plans to set the amounts
	and terms of any equity compensation and may vary the equity award program from year to year to address the Companys then-current compensation objectives and strategic goals. The Committee believes that the Companys shareholders will be
	well served if a greater percentage of the long-term equity incentive program is related to achievement of the Companys Board-approved strategic objectives. To that end, the balanced LTI program consisting of service vested
	restricted share units (RSUs) and performance vested RSUs is a way to achieve its objectives. Generally, performance-vesting aligns executive long-term incentive rewards more directly with shareholders interests since achieving strategic
	objectives is a better measure of managements performance than the volatility of the stock market. Furthermore, the Committee believes that the shareholders are served well by decisions that further the Companys long-term strategic plan.
	The Committee also believes that the CEOs long-term incentive should generally be 100% dependent on the achievement of the Companys strategic objectives. Nevertheless, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to include some service
	vested RSUs in the long-term incentive program of the other officers in order to encourage retention of key executives over the duration of a business cycle. Additionally, upon vesting, it was mandated that the officers defer receipt of the shares
	received from the grants in 2009 through 2013 until, at the earliest, their retirement/termination date. This policy was replaced by the ownership guidelines discussed below in 2014.


	 


	15






	Long-term equity incentive grants were made under the Preformed Line Products Company Long Term
	Incentive Plan of 2008 (LTIP), which was initially approved by the Board and by the shareholders in 2008 and amended and restated by the Board and approved by the shareholders during 2011. Going forward, long term incentive grants will
	be made under the 2016 Incentive Plan (2016 Plan), which was approved by the Board and by the shareholders in 2016. The CEOs typical annual equity compensation awards are performance-based RSUs, vesting in three years based upon
	achieving performance standards approved at the time of the grant by the Companys Board of Directors. The typical annual equity compensation awards to the other participants are as follows:

	two-thirds

	of
	the award is performance-based RSUs, vesting in three years based on achieving performance standards approved at the time of the grant by the Companys Board of Directors, and

	one-third

	of the award is
	service-based RSUs, vesting three years after the date of the grant based solely on continued employment by the Company. The Committee chose to emphasize performance over three years (rather than weigh performance and service equally), because it
	believes this approach aligns the Companys performance with shareholders interests, while acknowledging the benefit from long-term service.


	For the performance-based RSUs, the number of shares in which the participant becomes vested will depend upon the specific level of growth in

	pre-tax

	income and sales growth measured over a specified period (historically, either

	one-year

	or three-year performance period), with thresholds of 0%, 2% and 5% for

	pre-tax

	income growth, and 0%, 3% and 5% for sales growth. The threshold payout is at 25% of the maximum number of performance-based RSUs if both measures are achieved, the target is at 50% if both 2% growth in

	pre-tax

	income and 3% growth in sales are achieved, and the maximum is at 100% of the number of RSUs subject to the award if 5% growth in each measure is achieved at the end of the three-year period. If only one of
	the two measures is achieved at any of these levels, the vesting percentage is weighted to provide for some additional vesting for achieving the higher measure. Dividends declared on RSUs are accrued as cash dividends.


	For the 2016 grants, the Committee once again analyzed the history of the RSU grants, and whether such grants effectively aligned the
	interests of the NEOs with the Companys interests, taking into account industry data and input from officers regarding the Companys markets, projections and costs. The Committees intention is to incentivize management to grow the
	Company while maintaining profit margins. Given the economic conditions and volatile Company performance over the past few years and the challenges in forecasting the external factors that drive the Companys sales, the Committee determined
	that it would use a three-year base as it had done so from 2008 to 2013 to measure growth during the performance period, and set the performance metrics at the growth percentages discussed above. The Committee recommended and the Board approved the
	grants in February 2016 to each of the officers including the CEO.


	The CEOs award is set at a number of RSUs equal to 100% of the
	CEOs salary if target performance is achieved, with a maximum award equal to 200% of his salary if the maximum performance is achieved. The awards to the other officers are as follows: the award is set at a number of RSUs equal to that
	percentage of participants salary that is specified at the time of grant if target performance is achieved. The maximum amount of the performance portion of the award is equal to two times the target award. The amount of the service-vested
	award that can be earned is equal to the target award. Each officer was granted the number of RSUs equal to the maximum level under the performance criteria.



	Retirement


	Benefits

	. The Company believes that retirement benefits are an important component of total compensation. The
	Companys primary retirement benefit consists of the Companys 401(k) and profit sharing plan under which all salaried employees of the Company, including officers, participate starting in their third year of employment. The amount the
	Company provides to the profit sharing plan is based on the recommendation of management, with the Boards approval. Typically, the Companys contribution under this plan is approximately 15% of the then-current years cash
	compensation which is consistent with the amount contributed for all full-time salaried employees of the Company, including the cash incentive award. When calculating the Companys contributions under


	 


	16






	the profit sharing plan, the Company does not consider gains from prior awards. Every aspect of this plan is the same for all salaried employees, including officers. Thus, each salaried
	participant elects the investment options with the same options offered to all salaried employees and officers. The plan does not involve any guaranteed minimum return or above-market returns; rather, the investment returns are dependent upon actual
	investment results. To the extent an employees award exceeds the maximum allowable contribution permitted under existing tax laws, the excess is accrued for (but not funded) under a

	non-qualified

	Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. The return under this Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan is calculated at a weighted average of the Treasury constant maturity

	one-year

	rate plus 1%.



	Executive


	Perquisites

	. Perquisites and other personal benefits do not comprise a significant aspect of the Companys
	compensation program. Although officers participate in the same benefit programs as the Companys other employees, the Company provides a few additional benefits to its officers. These benefits are designed to enable the officers to balance
	their personal, business and travel schedules. In 2016, benefits include the Companys payment of club dues, which was less than $4,000 annually per membership, for three of the NEOs as indicated in the accompanying Summary Compensation Table.
	The Company also pays annual dues for Robert G. Ruhlman at a club located near the Companys Rogers, Arkansas facility, which totaled approximately $3,000 in 2016. This benefit is also provided to four other

	non-officer

	employees, primarily for business entertainment purposes. Except as described here, the Company aircraft is available to all of the employees, including the officers, for business-related travel
	only. The CEO is permitted to use the Companys aircraft for personal purposes, as shown on the Summary Compensation Table. The Company also makes personal financial advice available to the CEO and tax advice available to all its officers.



	Ownership


	Guidelines

	. In 2009, the Board established a requirement that the NEOs defer receipt of all shares received upon
	vesting of RSUs until retirement or termination of employment. Upon advice from Aon Hewitt during its 2013 engagement, the Committee determined that ownership guidelines would provide a more flexible way to ensure executives maintain sufficient
	ownership position in the Company. In February 2014, the Committee recommended and the Board approved ownership guidelines to ensure that the NEOs have a stake in the future of the Company in lieu of the deferral requirement. The ownership
	guidelines require the CEO to hold six times his annualized base salary in equity of the Company, and the other officers to hold three times their annualized base salaries. The ownership guidelines state that the types of equity that count toward
	the ownership requirement are stock owned directly, stock owned in a Company-sponsored retirement plan, and the unvested portion of RSUs that are subject only to time-vesting. Each covered executive will have up to five years from the effective date
	of the 2014 ownership guidelines or the date such person becomes a covered executive to meet the stock ownership requirement.



	Tax


	Deductibility


	of


	Pay

	. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that a company may deduct in any one year with respect to each of its NEOs. All officers
	were below this threshold in 2016, except the CEO.

	Reflects the dollar amount of the grant date fair value, as determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) ASC Topic 718, with respect to performance-based and service-based restricted share
	units (RSUs) awarded under the LTIP. The value of performance-based RSUs was calculated assuming the highest level of the performance conditions achieved. The performance period for the 2014 performance-based RSUs ended on December 31, 2016 and
	the actual payout was at 0% of the maximum share number. For a further description of these awards, see the discussion under the heading Long-Term Equity Grants above and Note H  Share-Based Compensation to the Notes to
	Consolidated Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Also reflects the dollar amount in 2015 of the grant date fair value, as determined in
	accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, with respect to a

	one-time

	grant of restricted stock to the CEO and other officers. For a further description of these awards, see Note H  Share-Based Compensation to
	the Notes to Consolidated Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.






	(2)


	Reflects the dollar amount of the payout under the Companys Annual

	Non-Equity

	Incentive Plan based on a sliding scale of the Companys return on shareholders
	equity, ranging from 3% (for the threshold payout) to 11% (for the maximum payout), with target payout at 7%. The percentage achieved within this range determined the dollar amount of the award based on a percentage of salary, which is a maximum of
	100% for Robert G. Ruhlman and 85% for the other NEOs, in each case, subject to the Compensation Committees discretion as to the final payout amount. The Companys return on shareholders equity for 2016 was 9.2%, which would have
	resulted in a payout of 76% for Robert G. Ruhlman and 65% for the other NEOs. However, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion as to the final amount and determined to award a payout of 88% for Robert G. Ruhlman and 75% for the other
	NEOs. For a further description of the Annual

	Non-Equity

	Incentive Plan awards, see the discussion under the heading Annual Cash Incentive Awards above.

	(3)


	Reflects the employees 2016 earnings and interest accruals to the Companys

	non-qualified

	Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan, in which the Company accrues for (but does
	not fund) those employees contributions which exceed the maximum allowable contribution permitted under existing tax laws, in the following amounts: Robert G. Ruhlman, $177,518; Eric R. Graef, $57,621; Dennis F. McKenna, $59,954; William H.
	Haag III, $45,840; and David C. Sunkle, $41,212. See

	Non-qualified

	Deferred Compensation Table for additional information. Also reflects the following perquisites and personal benefits received by Robert G.
	Ruhlman: aggregate incremental cost for personal use of the Companys airplane of $37,041, club dues of $6,415, financial planning fees of $39,415 and tax preparation fees of $7,072. The aggregate incremental cost of the personal use of the
	corporate airplane is determined on a per flight basis and includes the cost of the fuel used, the hourly cost of aircraft maintenance for the applicable number of flight hours, landing fees, trip-related hangar and parking costs and other costs
	specifically incurred. Imputed income is assessed to Mr. Ruhlman amounting to the equivalent of a first-class ticket for comparable flights. Reflects the Companys contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan in 2016 of $39,750 for each NEO.
	Also reflects premiums paid for group term life insurance for 2016: Robert G. Ruhlman, $18,851; Eric R. Graef, $7,944; Dennis F. McKenna, $1,881; William H. Haag III, $2,404; and David C. Sunkle, $4,386.

	(1)


	Reflects the dollar amount of the payout under the Companys Annual

	Non-Equity

	Incentive Plan based on a sliding scale of the Companys return on shareholders
	equity, ranging from 4% (for the threshold payout) to 15% (for the maximum payout), with target payout at 9.5%. The percentage achieved within this range determines the amount of the award based on a percentage of salary, which is a maximum of 100%
	for Robert G. Ruhlman and 85% for the other NEOs, in each case, subject to the Compensation Committees discretion as to the final payout amount. The Companys return on shareholders equity for 2016 was 9.2%, which would have
	resulted in a payout of 76% for Robert G. Ruhlman and 65% for the other NEOs. However, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion as to the final amount and determined to award a payout of 88% for Robert G. Ruhlman and 75% for the other
	NEOs. For a further description of the Annual

	Non-Equity

	Incentive Plan awards, see the discussion under the heading Annual Cash Incentive Awards above.






	(2)


	Reflects the number of performance-based restricted share award units (RSUs) granted during 2016 pursuant to the LTIP. The RSUs vest at the end of three-year performance period through December 31, 2018 based on
	the Companys level of performance. The number of shares the participant may receive depends upon the specific level of performance of growth in

	pre-tax

	income and sales growth over the three-year
	performance period, with thresholds of 0%, 2% and 5% for

	pre-tax

	income growth and 0%, 3% and 5% for sales growth. The threshold payout is at 25% of the maximum number of performance-based RSUs if both
	measures are achieved, the target is at 50% if 2% growth in

	pre-tax

	income and 3% growth in sales are achieved, and the maximum is at 100% of the numbers of shares subject to the award if 5% growth in

	pre-tax

	income and 5% growth in sales are achieved at the end of the three-year period. If only one of the two measures is achieved at any of these levels, the vesting percentage is weighted to provide for some
	additional vesting for achieving the higher measure.




	 


	19








	(3)


	Reflects the number of time-based RSUs granted during 2016 pursuant to the LTIP. The RSUs cliff vest and are no longer subject to risk of forfeiture after December 31, 2018 depending on continuous employment.




	(4) The value of the RSUs was calculated using the closing market price of the RSUs on the grant date multiplied by the number of RSUs
	granted, and reflects the probable total amount that the Company would expense in its financial statements over the restricted awards vesting period assuming service and performance goals are met, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.

	The Companys required future contributions under the Supplemental Profit-Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2016 included in the identified columns are also included in the Summary Compensation
	Table.    The amounts are based on the amount by which compensation from the Companys qualified retirement plan is limited by the IRS. Earnings are calculated based on an imputed interest rate of

	one-year

	Treasury bill rate plus 1% (1.65% for 2016) multiplied by the amount in such employees account under the plan.






	(2)


	Of the totals in this column, the following amounts have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table in previously reported proxy statements: Robert G. Ruhlman, $2,055,846; Eric R. Graef, $438,273; Dennis F.
	McKenna, $347,723; William H. Haag III, $374,213; and David C. Sunkle, $192,895.





	Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in
	Control



	 


	All of our
	employees, including NEOs, are employed at will and do not have employment, severance or


	change-in-control


	agreements. However, the LTIP includes a

	changein-control

	provision which provides that in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) (a) any options outstanding which are not then exercisable and vested shall become fully
	exercisable and vested; and (b) unless otherwise provided in the award agreements, any restricted share units outstanding shall vest and entitle the holder to the maximum number of shares that may be earned under the award. The award agreements
	for the RSUs provide that in the event of the Change in Control (a) all time-based RSUs outstanding shall fully vest and entitle the holder to the maximum number of shares that may be earned under the award and (b) all performance-based
	RSUs outstanding shall vest and entitle the holder to receive, at the end of the performance period applicable to the award (whether or not then still employed by the Company), the number of shares that are earned based on the achievement of the
	performance vesting conditions in effect for the duration of the award. The following table shows the amount the Companys NEOs would have received under the LTIP if a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2016, assuming that all
	performance conditions of performance-based RSUs were satisfied at the maximum level and that the shares earned were issued as of December 31, 2016. The amounts are equal to the value of the shares that would have vested as of December 31,
	2016 and, in the case of options, less the aggregate exercise price.

	The following details typical compensation arrangements upon retirement, resignation, death, disability or
	other termination for other plans.



	Profit-Sharing Plan



	Upon termination of employment, the employee may receive vested contributions plus income earned on those contributions under the
	Companys Profit Sharing Plan. Upon disability, the IRS allows withdrawals to be made if the employee became permanently disabled. Upon death, the vested account balance of the employee will be paid to the designated beneficiaries.



	Supplemental Profit-Sharing Plan



	Our
	Supplemental Profit-Sharing Plan was established to compensate employees whose benefits in the Profit-Sharing Plan were reduced due to IRS limitations on compensation. Upon termination of employment, the employee may receive vested contributions
	plus income earned on those contributions. Upon disability, the IRS allows withdrawals to be made if the employee became permanently disabled. Upon death, the vested account balance of the employee will be paid to the designated beneficiaries.



	Director Compensation



	Each director who
	is not an employee of the Company received an annual retainer fee of $25,000. Directors who are also employees are not paid a directors fee. Additionally, board members who serve on committees are also paid an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
	an award of 200 shares per committee per year, to be paid upon the completion of each calendar year, and chairpersons of each committee are paid an additional annual retainer of $10,000.


	Under the Board Stock Ownership Plan, committee members are required to maintain ownership of our common shares with a minimum aggregate
	market value of three times the amount of the annual cash retainer paid to a director for Board service (ignoring any additional retainer fees paid for service on Board committees) (the Ownership Requirement), and prohibits the sale of
	any common shares of Company stock owned by the committee member (except to pay the exercise price of stock options or tax liability generated as a result of equity grants) until such time as the Ownership Requirement is satisfied. Each committee
	member will have up to five years from the effective date of the Stock Ownership Plan (2014) or the date such person becomes a committee member to meet the ownership requirement.

	(1)


	Directors fees earned by R. Steven Kestner and Michael E. Gibbons were issued in common shares and held in the rabbi trust pursuant to the deferral election made under the Companys Directors Deferred
	Compensation Plan. On January 3, 2017, 622 common shares were transferred from the rabbi trust to R. Steven Kestner per his deferral agreement.






	(2)


	The value of the shares granted was calculated using the closing market price of the shares on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares granted, and reflects the amount that the Company has expensed in its
	financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.








	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation



	 


	No director serving on the
	Compensation Committee during any part of 2016 was at any time either during or before 2016, an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. No interlocking relationship exists between the Board or Compensation Committee and the
	board of directors or compensation committee of any other company, nor has any interlocking relationship existed during 2016.



	Transactions with
	Related Person



	 


	It is the
	policy of the Company that the Audit Committee approves all related party transactions. Additionally, the Company has a Code of Conduct that addresses the Companys commitment to the honesty, integrity and ethical behavior of the Companys
	directors, officers and employees. The Code governs the actions and working relationships of the Companys directors, officers and employees with current and potential customers, consumers, fellow employees, competitors, government and
	self-regulatory agencies, investors, the public, the media and anyone else with whom the Company has or may have contact. Each director, officer and employee is instructed to inform the Board when confronted with a situation that may be perceived as
	a conflict of interest. All related party transactions must be approved by the Audit Committee in advance. The Audit Committee may engage outside parties to assist it in assessing the fairness and reasonableness of related party transactions.
	Although the policies and procedures for related parties are not in writing, the results of actions taken by the Audit Committee are documented in formal minutes and are reported to the Board. The following are the Transactions with Related Parties
	which have been approved by the Audit Committee and reported to the Board in 2016:


	 




	 


	


	 


	On August 23, 2016, the Company purchased 27,448 common shares of the Company from a trust for the benefit of Barbara P. Ruhlman and a foundation of which Barbara P. Ruhlman, Robert G. Ruhlman and Bernard Karr are
	officers, at a price per share of $44.66, which was calculated from a

	30-day

	average of market price. Barbara P. Ruhlman is a Director Emeritus on the Companys Board of Directors, the mother of Robert G.
	Ruhlman and grandmother of J. Ryan Ruhlman, both of whom are executive officers, and Maegan A. Ruhlman, all of whom are also members of the Board of Directors. The purchase was consummated pursuant to two Share Purchase Agreements both dated
	August 23, 2016, one between the Company and the trust and the other between the Company and the foundation.




	 


	23








	 


	


	 


	On December 29, 2016, the Company purchased 5,000 common shares of the Company from Robert G. Ruhlman, at a price per share of $56.38, which was calculated from a

	30-day

	average of market price.




	 




	 


	


	 


	J. Ryan Ruhlman is the Vice President, Marketing and Business Development and is a member of the Companys Board of Directors. He is the son of Robert G. Ruhlman, President and CEO of the Company, and brother to
	Maegan A. Ruhlman, member of the Companys Board of Directors. Mr. Ryan Ruhlman received $315,000 in reportable compensation for 2016.




	 




	 


	


	 


	During 2016, the Company paid approximately $210,000 in legal fees to Baker & Hostetler LLP, of which R. Steven Kestner is the Chairman and the chair of its policy committee. Mr. Kestner is a director of
	the Company.





	PROPOSAL TWO: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation



	 



	The Board recommends that you
	vote FOR the advisory vote to approve the Companys executive compensation.



	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
	Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd Frank Act) enables the Companys shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory or

	non-binding

	basis, the compensation of our Named Executive
	Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. Executive compensation is an important matter for the Companys shareholders. As discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled Compensation Discussion
	and Analysis (CD&A), a fundamental principle the Companys executive compensation philosophy and practice continues to be pay for performance. The Company believes that the NEOs and other officers and key executives are
	compensated in a manner consistent with the Companys strategy, competitive practice, sound corporate governance principles, and shareholder interest and concerns. The Company believes that the Companys compensation programs are strongly
	aligned with the long-term interests of its shareholders. You are urged to read the CD&A section of this proxy statement for additional details on the Companys executive compensation, including the Companys compensation philosophy
	and objectives for the compensation of the NEOs.


	As an advisory vote, this proposal is

	non-binding.

	Although the vote is

	non-binding,

	the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of the shareholders, and will consider the
	outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for the Companys NEOs.



	PROPOSAL THREE: Advisory Vote on Frequency of Voting on
	Executive Compensation



	 



	The Board recommends that you vote FOR every three years for the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation.



	The Company is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to seek a

	non-binding

	advisory shareholder
	vote every six years regarding the frequency (annually, every other year or every three years) at which the Company will ask its shareholders to provide the advisory vote on executive compensation. The Company believes that holding the advisory vote
	on executive compensation every three years is appropriate, given the history of few changes to the executive compensation as well as the composition of the Officers, and the cycle on reviewing compensation policies as followed by the Compensation
	Committee. Therefore, the Company is asking shareholders to vote for every three years for the frequency of executive pay voting.


	 


	24






	As an advisory vote, this proposal is

	non-binding.

	Although the vote is

	non-binding,

	the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and understand that executive compensation is an important matter, and they will
	consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions on the frequency of the Companys executive compensation advisory votes.



	PROPOSAL
	FOUR: Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst &Young LLP



	 



	The Board recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.



	The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as the Companys independent registered public accounting
	firm for the year ending December 31, 2017. For 2016, the Company engaged EY to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016, to audit the annual financial statements and to
	perform audit-related and tax services. Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the annual meeting of shareholders, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate
	questions.


	The Board of Directors seeks an indication from shareholders of their approval or disapproval of the Audit Committees
	appointment of EY as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for 2017. The submission of this matter for approval by the shareholders is not legally required. The Board believes that submission of this matter presents an
	opportunity for the shareholders to provide feedback to the Board on an important issue of corporate governance. If the shareholders do not approve the appointment of EY, the appointment will be

	re-evaluated

	by the Audit Committee but will not require the Audit Committee to appoint a different accounting firm. The Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it
	determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.






	OTHER MATTERS




	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



	 


	The Audit Committee of the Board of
	Directors appointed Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	The aggregate fees billed for
	professional services rendered by EY were $1,852,000 for the audit of the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, the audit of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016,
	EYs review of the financial statements included in the Companys Form

	10-Qs

	filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 and statutory
	audits of various international subsidiaries. The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by EY were $1,802,400 for the audit of the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, the audit of
	internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, EYs review of the financial statements included in the Companys Form

	10-Qs

	filed with the Securities and Exchange

	Audit Related Fees



	The incremental fees billed for professional services rendered by EY for audit-related services for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
	2015 were $4,600 and $1,000, respectively. Fees included in 2016 were for a research grant audit at the Companys New Zealand subsidiary and a royalty audit at the Companys South African subsidiary. Fees included in 2015 were for a
	royalty audit at the Companys South African subsidiary.


	 


	25







	Tax Fees



	The incremental fees billed for professional services rendered by EY for

	tax-related

	services for the
	year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4,000 and $4,400, respectively. Fees included for both years were for tax consulting and transfer pricing analysis at the Companys Mexican subsidiary.    



	All Other Fees



	There were no incremental
	fees billed for professional services rendered by EY for all other services for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	 



	SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL
	OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE



	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Companys directors and executive officers, and
	owners of more than 10% of our common shares, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common shares and other equity securities. Executive
	officers, directors and owners of more than 10% of the common shares are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all forms they file pursuant to Section 16(a).


	Based solely on a review of these reports and written representations from the executive officers and directors, the Company believes that
	there was compliance with all such filing requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, other than (a) Director Glen E. Corlett inadvertently failed to timely report the purchase of 1,000 common shares on May 11, 2015, and
	filed a Form 4 reporting the transaction on March 22, 2016, (b) Mr. Haag inadvertently failed to timely report shares purchased on January 1, 2015, April 20, 2015, July 20, 2015, and October 20, 2015 due to automatic
	dividend reinvestment, and filed a Form 4/A reporting the transactions on March 22, 2016, (c) Director J. Ryan Ruhlman inadvertently failed to report his ownership of 650 common shares indirectly held in an IRA and 534 common shares directly
	held on the Form 3 filed on August 10, 2015, and filed a Form 3/A reporting the ownership on February 7, 2017, and (d) Messrs. Curlee, Graef, Haag, Hofstetter, McKenna, Sunkle and Ms. Vaccariello each failed to timely report
	RSUs granted on February 24, 2015 and February 3, 2016, and each subsequently filed Forms 4/A reporting the transactions on March 22, 2016.






	SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2018 ANNUAL MEETING

	14a-8

	Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by the Company at 660 Beta Drive, Mayfield Village, Ohio 44143, on or before November 17, 2017, for inclusion in the proxy

	earlier than January 9, 2018 and not later than February 8, 2018 and must comply with all provisions of our Amended and Restated Code of Regulations.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Where there are no other resources available, and where the Trustee is compelled to do so, the Trustee may resolve any legally enforceable debts, taxes, reasonable funeral expenses, burial expenses and any expenses related to the final illness of the Grantor out of the resources of this Living Trust.

The Trustee may make the Final Distribution in any combination of cash and property. Property selection and valuation in the course of the Final Distribution will be made in the good faith discretion of the Trustee and will be binding on all Beneficiaries.



It is incumbent on the Trustee to act as fiduciaries, in good faith and in the best interest of the Living Trust.

All decisions of the acting Trustee, made in good faith, regarding the management of this Living Trust will be final and binding on all parties.

The above authority and powers granted to the Trustee are in addition to any powers and elective rights conferred by state or federal law or by other provision of this Living Trust and may be exercised as often as required, and without application to or approval by any court.

Any Trustee who is not a Beneficiary of this Living Trust will receive reasonable compensation out of the resources of this Living Trust for services rendered. A Trustee who is also a Beneficiary under this Living Trust will serve without compensation.

In the event that the acting Trustee concludes that the value of the Property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration and that the aggregate value of the Property is less than $50,000.00 (USD), the acting Trustee may terminate this Living Trust after providing notice to the Qualified Beneficiaries. Where this Living Trust is terminated under this section, the acting Trustee will distribute the Property in a manner consistent with and as described in the distributions sections of this Living Trust.

Abstract of Trust

The acting Trustee may execute an abstract of this Living Trust (the "Abstract of Trust") and may present the Abstract of Trust to a financial institution as proof of the existence of this Living Trust.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Where there are no other resources available, and where the Trustee is compelled to do so, the Trustee may resolve any legally enforceable debts, taxes, reasonable funeral expenses, burial expenses and any expenses related to the final illness of the Grantor out of the resources of this Living Trust.

The Trustee may make the Final Distribution in any combination of cash and property. Property selection and valuation in the course of the Final Distribution will be made in the good faith discretion of the Trustee and will be binding on all Beneficiaries.



It is incumbent on the Trustee to act as fiduciaries, in good faith and in the best interest of the Living Trust.

All decisions of the acting Trustee, made in good faith, regarding the management of this Living Trust will be final and binding on all parties.

The above authority and powers granted to the Trustee are in addition to any powers and elective rights conferred by state or federal law or by other provision of this Living Trust and may be exercised as often as required, and without application to or approval by any court.

Any Trustee who is not a Beneficiary of this Living Trust will receive reasonable compensation out of the resources of this Living Trust for services rendered. A Trustee who is also a Beneficiary under this Living Trust will serve without compensation.

In the event that the acting Trustee concludes that the value of the Property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration and that the aggregate value of the Property is less than $50,000.00 (USD), the acting Trustee may terminate this Living Trust after providing notice to the Qualified Beneficiaries. Where this Living Trust is terminated under this section, the acting Trustee will distribute the Property in a manner consistent with and as described in the distributions sections of this Living Trust.

Abstract of Trust

The acting Trustee may execute an abstract of this Living Trust (the "Abstract of Trust") and may present the Abstract of Trust to a financial institution as proof of the existence of this Living Trust.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
