Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporation FAQ
Find FAQs related to forming a corporation.
















What are the main differences between a C corporation and an S corporation?


C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, one tax at the corporate level on the corporation's net income, and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed. S corporations have only one level of taxation. All of their income is allocated to the shareholders.
However, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability. In addition, S corporations are subject to limitations, such as the number and type of shareholders they can have.
LegalZoom will help you start a C corporation or an S corporation. Get started by answering a few questions about your company, and we will file your paperwork with the Secretary of State.



 





How do I choose a corporate name?


In general, the name of a corporation must end with "incorporated,"
            "corporation" or an abbreviation of one of these. A name will not be accepted
            if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name
            of another corporation already formed in that state. Many states also
            restrict the use of certain terms in a corporation's name (like bank, police
            or insurance).
LegalZoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names, in order of
            preference. We will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are
            available. Please note that for government purposes the names "ABC, Inc." and
            "A.B.C., Corp." are identical. Therefore, you should disregard spaces, periods
            and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name
            choices.
If the name of your corporation will be used in connection with
            goods or services, you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark
            protection for the name. This helps ensure that no one else in the U.S. may use
            that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services
            (except in areas where someone else is already using that
            name).



 





Is a corporation required to have a registered agent?


Each corporation must have a registered agent  (some states use the term "resident agent" 
            or "statutory agent," but the concept is the same). This is the person
            designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the
            corporation is served with a lawsuit. Most states require that the registered agent must be
            either:

(1) an adult living in the state of formation with a street
              address (P.O. boxes are not acceptable) or
(2) a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation
              that provides registered agent services.

One of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is
            that any officer or director (of a corporation) or manager or member (of an LLC) can act as the registered agent. However, there
            are some advantages to having another person or company act as your
            registered agent. First, this adds an extra layer of privacy, since the
            registered agent's name and address are publicly available. Second, this
            helps limit the risk that if your corporation or LLC is named as a defendant in a lawsuit, no one will surprise
            you at home on a Sunday night with court papers.



 





How much will it cost to form and run a corporation?


Each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation. In many
            states, you must also submit an "annual report" or "list of directors and
            officers," which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have
            state taxes.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Delaware?


The advantages of incorporating in Delaware according to the Delaware Secretary of State: 
More than half a million business entities have their legal home in Delaware. This includes more than half of all U.S. publicly-traded and Fortune 500 companies. Businesses choose Delaware for its complete incorporation services package, which includes modern and flexible corporate laws, the highly-respected Delaware Courts, a business-friendly state government and the customer service oriented staff of the Delaware Division of Corporations. 



 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


An LLC has more operating flexibility and fewer
            corporate formalities than an S corporation. For example, an S corporation
            cannot have more than 100 stockholders and must hold both periodic director's
            meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders. However, owners of an S
            corporation may be subject to fewer taxes than LLC owners.
            For more information, please see "Differences
            Between a Corporation and a Limited Liability Company (LLC)" from the main
            guide.


 





Do I need an attorney to form a corporation?


No, you do not need an attorney to form a corporation. You can
            prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a legal
            documentation service such as LegalZoom.
To learn more and speak with a representative, please call us at
            (888) 381-8758.



 





What is the procedure for forming a corporation, and what legal documents are required?


To create a corporation, you must file a document called the "articles of incorporation" 
            with the Secretary of State or other appropriate state agency. Next,
            bylaws and organizing resolutions must be adopted. A corporation will also
            need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS.
Unlike many other incorporation services which only
            create and file the articles of incorporation, LegalZoom can 
            complete all of these required documents for you, including personalized bylaws
            and organizational resolutions.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Nevada?


According to the Nevada Secretary of State, the following details the advantages of incorporating in Nevada: 

No corporate income tax 

No taxes on corporate shares 
No franchise tax 
No personal income tax 
No I.R.S. information sharing agreement 
Nominal annual fees 
Minimal reporting and disclosure requirements 
Stockholders are not on public record 



 





What are the naming conventions for professional corporations?


Have you ever noticed the initials "P.C." or "P.A." after a company's
            name? These initials indicate the company is a professional corporation ("P.C.") 
            or a professional association ("P.A."). State law dictates what is required in the 
            name, and those requirements differ by state.



 





What is a professional corporation?


Professional corporations (PC) are corporations that provide
            professional services. State law and the regulating board determine what
            constitutes professional services and when you are required to be a
            professional corporation. This varies from state to
            state.



 





Can I be the only shareholder in my corporation?


Yes, a corporation can be formed with only one shareholder.
            However, corporate formalities, such as director and shareholder meetings,
            are still required in order to preserve the corporate form and prevent the
            shareholder from personal liability.



 





What is a corporation?



            A corporation is a distinct legal entity created under state laws which can
            open a bank account, purchase property, enter into contracts and operate a
            business. One of the most important features of a corporation is that,
            generally, its owners are not personally liable for the debts of the
            corporation.


 





When is a corporation considered a professional corporation?


The definition of "professionals" can vary from state to state, but typically includes professions that require a license, such as doctors, chiropractors, lawyers, dentists, accountants, architects or engineers. Depending on the state where you incorporate, the following activities may be classified as professional services. 
Accounting and financial services 
Architectural services
Legal services
Medical services



 





Where should I incorporate?


A corporation can incorporate in any of the 50 states, plus the
            District of Columbia. Many people choose to incorporate in their home
            state, which can save money in filing fees. That is because corporations are
            required to register in each state where they do business. For example, a
            Delaware corporation that has its main business office in Arkansas must
            register as a "foreign corporation" with the Arkansas Secretary of
            State and must pay applicable fees and taxes to both Delaware and Arkansas. Delaware is popular
            because of its history, experience and pro-business climate. Nevada is also
            popular because of its pro-business environment and lack of a formal
            information-sharing agreement with the IRS. Please read the next two FAQs for
            more specifics on each state.



 





Who can form a corporation?


Generally, anyone who completes the articles of incorporation and pays the
            state filing fee can form a corporation. There are usually no residency or
            other legal requirements. However, many states require that an individual forming 
            a corporation must be at least 18 years old.

Authentidate Holding Corp. (Authentidate), incorporated on April 10, 1992, and its subsidiaries provide Web-based revenue cycle management applications, and telehealth products and services. The Company enables healthcare organizations to coordinate care for patients and to manage related administrative and clinical workflows. The Company's Web-based services are delivered as Software as a Service (SaaS) to its customers interfacing with billing, information and document management systems. These solutions incorporate multiple features and security technologies, such as business-rules based electronic forms, intelligent routing, transaction management, electronic signatures, identity credentialing, content authentication, automated audit trails and remote patient management capabilities. Both Web and fax-based communications are integrated into automated workflow solutions.The Company's telehealth solutions provide in-home patient vital signs monitoring systems and services. Its telehealth solutions combine its tablet or Electronic House Call patient vital signs monitoring appliances or its Interactive Voice Response patient vital signs monitoring solution with a Web-based management and monitoring software module. Both solutions enable unattended measurements of patients' vital signs and related health information and are designed to aid wellness and preventative care and deliver care to specific patient segments that require regular monitoring of medical and behavioral health conditions. Healthcare providers can view each specific patient's vital statistics and make adjustments to the patient's care plans via the Internet. The service provides a combination of care plan schedule reminders and disease management education, as well as intelligent routing to alert on-duty caregivers whenever a patient's vital signs are outside of the practitioner's pre-set ranges. The Company is engaged in the development and sale of Web-based services based on its Inscrybe platform and related capabilities, and its telehealth products and services.Inscrybe HealthcareThe Inscrybe Healthcare is a Web-based revenue cycle management workflow automation solution that enables healthcare industry participants to exchange and track a range of documents, certificates, authorizations, and other information over different modes of communication, including electronic and fax delivery. Inscrybe Healthcare incorporates electronic signatures; business-rules based electronic forms; content authentication using AuthentiProof; workflow intelligence for routing and transaction management, and identity credentialing and verification. Inscrybe Healthcare allows users to simplify complex clinical and administrative processes required for patient care, and facilitates order processing, online review and electronic signature of healthcare documentation, while validating the identity of the parties involved. Inscrybe Healthcare is used to track and manage various kinds of structured and unstructured data, and can be interfaced with existing in-house and external systems, including Health Information Exchange infrastructures. Inscrybe Healthcare includes workflow automation solutions, such as Inscrybe Referral and Order Management, and Inscrybe Hospital Discharge.Inscrybe Referral and Order Management provides an automated process for the exchange, update, completion and management of healthcare orders, including certificates of medical necessity, plan-of-care forums, written orders, interim orders, prior authorizations, claim attachments and other supporting documentation required by healthcare payers for reimbursement of medical equipment and service claims from care providers. Inscrybe Hospital Discharge automates the hospital discharge planning process and enables hospital case managers, social workers, and discharge planners to optimize the patient discharge process.Telehealth SolutionsTelehealth Solutions provide an advanced in-home patient vital signs monitoring system and a Web-based management and monitoring software module for use by healthcare providers. Its remote patient monitoring tablet and Electronic House Call devices work with peripheral devices, such as blood pressure monitors, weight scales, thermometers, glucometers, sleep apnea devices and wound care cameras, for unassisted patient vital signs measurement and monitoring. The system allows for manual entry or automatically takes vital signs from peripherals (both wired and wireless devices) and communicates with the practitioner over the Internet for analysis and intervention. Patients can access the information on the monitoring software interface to review their own vital statistics history, as well as to obtain reminders of their scheduled medications, practitioner instructions, and therapy regimen. The system also includes onscreen patient treatment information, disease management education, and intelligent routing to alert on-duty caregivers if any vital statistics fall outside of the range of parameters pre-set by the practitioner. The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) patient vital signs monitoring solution offers patients an alternative for using vital signs in-home monitoring device.AuthentiProofThe AuthentiProof is a content integrity and time-and-date stamp application, which enables a user to have a digital record of a transaction created and stored by a third-party that can be used to verify the content, date, time and parties related to the transaction in the future. AuthentiProof can be used to verify the authenticity of a document or file sent electronically as of a specific point in time and allows users to detect whether or not documents or files with an AuthentiProof seal have been altered or modified. AuthentiProof incorporates its content authentication technology.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
