Enterprises
For an enterprise that has branch offices connecting to the headquarters, Virtual Leased Line (VLL) powered by Truffle SD-WAN appliance with Broadband Bonding technology provides a unique WAN bonding value proposition. With Truffle network appliances at the branch offices and at the headquarter, the branch offices will be able to bond together their various Internet access lines to create a virtual, secure, fast and reliable IP pipe to and from their headquarters, including VPN bonding. VLL is an ideal high performance alternative to MPLS and is highly cost effective. VLL can also be utilized to offload public Internet traffic off of MPLS when deployed along side with MPLS - generating huge savings in MPLS bandwidth cost. VLL is a very cost effective MPLS alternative.



Additionally, if the branch office Internet traffic is funneled through the headquarter (such as through a VPN), then the branch office will enjoy VPN bonding and the bonded speeds not only for the point-to-point connection to the headquarter, but also for the traffic to/from the public Internet. Optionally, the remote office public Internet traffic can be offloaded and bonded locally.

To learn more about Mushroom’s SD-WAN enterprise solution with WAN bonding technology, please contact us via email or phone.
Additional information about VLL and Truffle is available here - Virtual Leased Line for headquarter to branch office communications.

If you use cloud-based platforms such as Office 365, Salesforce, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, you need to ensure that all of your critical applications and devices are available when needed and secured.
Barracuda NextGen Firewalls are purpose-built for the modern, distributed network in which network performance and availability is as important as security. Unlike traditional port-based firewalls, our firewalls are application-aware, enabling you to regulate application usage and intelligently prioritize network traffic.
We offer two series of firewalls, each delivering advanced, next-generation performance and protection, yet geared for distinct environments: 

The X-Series is designed for small to mid-market organizations that need to quickly and easily deploy a Next Generation firewall.
The F-Series is the Barracuda Firewall for the cloud era. It consolidates advanced, next-generation firewall, link balancing, and WAN Optimization technologies into one easy-to-manage appliance capable of on-premises, cloud, and virtual deployments. The F-Series allows organizations and managed services providers to securely enable remote Internet breakouts without the need to backhaul traffic. 
Appliance models are available from ultra-small appliances - for deployments with Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives - and small desktops for small office and home office (SOHO), all the way up to datacenter-level models. Yet all Barracuda NextGen F-Series Firewalls, regardless of deployment type or size, are manageable from a single pane of glass.  The Barracuda NextGen Control Center significantly increases rollout speed while reducing the associated costs involved in deploying, managing, and monitoring tens, hundreds, or even thousands of remote NextGen Firewall F-Series devices.

Benefits







Protect Your Organization from Advanced Malware and Zero-Hour Attacks
Barracuda NextGen Firewalls feature advanced security capabilities, including integrated Intrusion Prevention (IPS), URL filtering and antivirus to identify and block evasion attempts that would trick traditional systems. Barracuda’s security extends beyond your network to Barracuda’s Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) cloud for both statistical and sandboxing analysis of zero-day and targeted threats that routinely bypass signature-based IPS and antivirus engines.
Back to top  















Intelligently Manage Your Organization’s Traffic
User and application awareness provides intelligence and visibility to craft business rules to manage bandwidth and prioritize network traffic to by application. You can easily customize network access, application usage and bandwidth allocation for specific users and groups. When needed, traffic to non-business-related applications can be limited, even when this traffic is encrypted.
Dynamic link balancing  dynamically balances traffic across multiple Internet connections. This ensures business continuity through reliable Internet access as well as allows you to efficiently utilize available bandwidth. Intelligent site-to-site connection management  provides high quality, reliable connectivity across multiple locations (both hardware and virtual appliances). IPsec VPNs ensure secure connectivity to remote sites, centralized offices, as well as public cloud offerings like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
Back to top  










Easily Manage Your Network Growth
In modern organizations, network perimeter intelligence extends across highly dispersed environments: remote sites, branch offices and satellite locations. As your policy enforcement becomes more dispersed, centralized management becomes more important to minimize management overhead and maintain a uniform security posture. For this reason, central management is integrated into the Barracuda next-generation firewall architecture. Administrators can easily define global security parameters, configure security and network access policies, control firewall firmware update revisions, and manage user settings. Barracuda provides a true centralized management system that is fully scalable across thousands of locations through a single pane of glass.

The Cloud-Integrated All-in-One Backup Solution


 Easy to set up and manage Single-vendor solution for on-premise and cloud data Multiple deployment options Data backup to secure cloud or private location 
Protecting your data in today’s complex infrastructures—combining on-premises, virtual, cloud-hosted, and SaaS environments—presents challenges that competing backup solutions can’t adequately meet. At best, you’ll spend a lot more time and money managing and maintaining multiple solutions. At worst, gaps in coverage leave your data vulnerable. Barracuda Backup is designed from the ground up for the cloud-integrated systems you depend on today. It gives you the flexibility to easily back up data wherever it resides—on premises or in the cloud—and to replicate the data to our secure cloud or to a private location of your choice. Simple to configure and manage, and totally automated, Barracuda Backup is truly a “set it and forget it” solution for total peace of mind.

Protecting Data EverywhereThe days when you only had to protect data in your on-premises servers are gone. Now you also are responsible for securing SaaS and cloud-hosted applications such as Microsoft Office 365. Barracuda Backup has the power and flexibility to efficiently protect data wherever it resides.








Deploy our backup solution any way you want it: Appliance, Virtual, or Cloud-to-Cloud.
*Barracuda Backup 390 appliance shown















Built for the Cloud—Simple and Scalable The job of managing data across multiple environments is complex, but backup and disaster recovery don't have to be. Deployment, configuration, and ongoing management are fast and easy, thanks to a centralized cloud-based console that gives you complete, single-pane-of-glass visibility into all Barracuda solutions in the global network.  Your shift to the cloud includes moving data into SaaS environments such as Office 365, and your backup strategy must account for that. Barracuda Cloud-to-Cloud Backup protects you against data loss and unintended deletion in Microsoft Office 365. 

Key Features: 
									Replication, Unlimited Barracuda Cloud Storage, Centralized Management, Cloud-to-Cloud Backup, Flexible Deployments, more














Protected by Off-Site and Cloud Replication Barracuda Backup can automatically replicate your data to a second, off-site physical or virtual appliance, for more complete protection and peace of mind.Alternatively, use Barracuda Cloud Storage to securely and seamlessly replicate your backed-up data to our geographically distributed, enterprise-grade data centers. Redundant, multi-site storage prevents data loss in case of disaster, and military-grade 256-bit AES encryption ensures data in transit is completely secure.

Key Features: 
									Data Recovery, Inline Deduplication, Replication, Offsite Vaulting, Near Continuous Data Protection, more





















Reliable and Predictable
To protect your backup systems from failures, all Barracuda Backup products include Energize Updates that automatically apply software updates to improve performance and keep you protected from the latest threats. Updates are sent as frequently as needed to protect you from zero-day security threats.
 Barracuda Instant Replacement provides next-business-day replacement in
   case of failure or malfunction. Barracuda will even preload the most
   recent data and configuration settings stored in Barracuda Cloud
   Storage onto the replacement unit for emergency restores in the event
   of a complete site disaster. And an included complementary hardware
   refresh every four years will keep you on the latest platform at no
   additional cost.

On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]

Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space. In June, 2012, Barracuda signed a lease to occupy the 45,000 square foot office complex previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard St in downtown Ann Arbor.[21]
In July 2012, Dean Drako, Barracuda Networks’s co-founder, president and CEO since it was founded in 2003, resigned his operating position, remaining on the company’s board of directors.[22] At the time of Drako’s departure, the company stated it had achieved profitability,[23] a nearly ongoing 30 annual percent growth rate since inception, 150,000 customers worldwide, nearly 1,000 employees, 10 offices, and did business in 80 countries.[24] The company created the office of the CEO as it started a CEO search.[25]
In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.

History[edit]
Barracuda Networks was founded in 2003 by Dean Drako (founding CEO), Michael Perone, and Zach Levow; the company introduced the Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall in the same year.[2][3][4] In 2007 the company moved its headquarters to Campbell, California,[5] and opened an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[6]
In January 2006, it closed its first outside investment of $40 million from Sequoia Capital and Francisco Partners.[7]
On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]
In 2012, the company became a co-sponsor of the Garmin-Barracuda UCI ProTour cycling team [18] and entitlement sponsor of the 2011 Indianapolis 500 champion Bryan Herta Autosport in the IZOD IndyCar Series, with the #98 Lotus driven by Alex Tagliani, who will defend the team's championship.[19]
Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space.

In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.
In November 2013, Barracuda Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CUDA.[27]
In March 2015, Barracuda Networks expanded its business to North Asia and was distributed by TriTech Distribution Limited in Hong Kong.[28]

History[edit]
Barracuda Networks was founded in 2003 by Dean Drako (founding CEO), Michael Perone, and Zach Levow; the company introduced the Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall in the same year.[2][3][4] In 2007 the company moved its headquarters to Campbell, California,[5] and opened an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[6]
In January 2006, it closed its first outside investment of $40 million from Sequoia Capital and Francisco Partners.[7]
On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]
In 2012, the company became a co-sponsor of the Garmin-Barracuda UCI ProTour cycling team [18] and entitlement sponsor of the 2011 Indianapolis 500 champion Bryan Herta Autosport in the IZOD IndyCar Series, with the #98 Lotus driven by Alex Tagliani, who will defend the team's championship.[19]
Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space. In June, 2012, Barracuda signed a lease to occupy the 45,000 square foot office complex previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard St in downtown Ann Arbor.[21]
In July 2012, Dean Drako, Barracuda Networks’s co-founder, president and CEO since it was founded in 2003, resigned his operating position, remaining on the company’s board of directors.[22] At the time of Drako’s departure, the company stated it had achieved profitability,[23] a nearly ongoing 30 annual percent growth rate since inception, 150,000 customers worldwide, nearly 1,000 employees, 10 offices, and did business in 80 countries.[24] The company created the office of the CEO as it started a CEO search.[25]
In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.
In November 2013, Barracuda Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CUDA.[27]
In March 2015, Barracuda Networks expanded its business to North Asia and was distributed by TriTech Distribution Limited in Hong Kong.[28]
In November 2015, Barracuda added new Next Generation Firewall to its firewall family.[29]
Barracuda has announced future discontinuation of its Copy and CudaDrive services as of May 2016.[30]

Web Security Service - In October 2009, in conjunction with its acquisition of Purewire, Barracuda Networks launched the Purewire Web Security Service which is a software as a service offering for Web filtering, content security, and safe web surfing.[42]
NextGen Firewall - In February 2010, Barracuda announced its NextGen Firewalls to protect enterprise network infrastructures. The firewalls integrate web and email filtering, intrusion prevention, layer 7 application profiling, and network access control into one platform that is centrally managed across multiple distributed enterprise network locations. NextGen Firewalls are available as a hardware appliance, virtual appliance and public cloud instance. The product includes wide area network traffic optimization.[43]

In January 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Yosemite Technologies to add software agents for incremental backups of applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server, and Windows system states.[41][50]
September 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired controlling interest in phion AG, an Austria-based public company delivering enterprise-class firewalls.[51]
In October 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Purewire Inc, a software as a service (SaaS) company offering cloud based web filtering and security.[52][53]

In October 2015, Barracuda Networks acquired Intronis.[56]
Security Issue[edit]
In January 2013, a backdoor was discovered: "A variety of firewall, VPN, and spam filtering gear sold by Barracuda Networks contains undocumented backdoor accounts that allow people to remotely log in and access sensitive information, researchers with an Austrian security firm have warned." The backdoor was then secured shortly after the announcement.[57]

History[edit]
Barracuda Networks was founded in 2003 by Dean Drako (founding CEO), Michael Perone, and Zach Levow; the company introduced the Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall in the same year.[2][3][4] In 2007 the company moved its headquarters to Campbell, California,[5] and opened an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[6]
In January 2006, it closed its first outside investment of $40 million from Sequoia Capital and Francisco Partners.[7]
On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]
In 2012, the company became a co-sponsor of the Garmin-Barracuda UCI ProTour cycling team [18] and entitlement sponsor of the 2011 Indianapolis 500 champion Bryan Herta Autosport in the IZOD IndyCar Series, with the #98 Lotus driven by Alex Tagliani, who will defend the team's championship.[19]
Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space. In June, 2012, Barracuda signed a lease to occupy the 45,000 square foot office complex previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard St in downtown Ann Arbor.[21]
In July 2012, Dean Drako, Barracuda Networks’s co-founder, president and CEO since it was founded in 2003, resigned his operating position, remaining on the company’s board of directors.[22] At the time of Drako’s departure, the company stated it had achieved profitability,[23] a nearly ongoing 30 annual percent growth rate since inception, 150,000 customers worldwide, nearly 1,000 employees, 10 offices, and did business in 80 countries.[24] The company created the office of the CEO as it started a CEO search.[25]
In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.
In November 2013, Barracuda Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CUDA.[27]
In March 2015, Barracuda Networks expanded its business to North Asia and was distributed by TriTech Distribution Limited in Hong Kong.[28]
In November 2015, Barracuda added new Next Generation Firewall to its firewall family.[29]
Barracuda has announced future discontinuation of its Copy and CudaDrive services as of May 2016.[30]
Products[edit]




As with most Barracuda solutions, the Barracuda Next Gen Firewall can be deployed on premises as a hardware appliance, or in private or public cloud networks as a virtual appliance.

Load balancer ADC - In November 2006, the company introduced a load balancing appliance for high availability distribution of network traffic across multiple servers.[35]
Message Archiver - In July 2007, the company introduced message archiving to index and preserve emails, and to meet legal and regulatory compliance.[36]
SSL VPN & Remote Access - In November 22008, the company launched its secure sockets layer virtual private network product to provide secure, clientless, remote access.[37]

Barracuda Backup - In November 2008, the company announced a service to back up data in the cloud, including on-site backup with data deduplication and off-site data replication for disaster recovery.[40] In January 2009, Barracuda added message-level backup for Microsoft Exchange and Novell GroupWise, integrating Barracuda Backup Service with Yosemite Backup, formerly Tapeware.[41]
Web Security Service - In October 2009, in conjunction with its acquisition of Purewire, Barracuda Networks launched the Purewire Web Security Service which is a software as a service offering for Web filtering, content security, and safe web surfing.[42]
NextGen Firewall - In February 2010, Barracuda announced its NextGen Firewalls to protect enterprise network infrastructures. The firewalls integrate web and email filtering, intrusion prevention, layer 7 application profiling, and network access control into one platform that is centrally managed across multiple distributed enterprise network locations. NextGen Firewalls are available as a hardware appliance, virtual appliance and public cloud instance. The product includes wide area network traffic optimization.[43]
CudaTel Communication Server (PBX) - in August 2010, Barracuda announced the release of CudaTel, a VOIP Private branch exchange designed for IT administrators. CudaTel features FreeSWITCH, an open-source project sponsored by Barracuda Networks.[44]
Copy.com was announced as a cloud storage service in February 2013.[45][46] The service was discontinued on May 1, 2016.[30]

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2007, Barracuda Networks acquired NetContinuum, a company providing application controllers to secure and manage enterprise web applications.[47]
In November 2008, Barracuda Networks expanded into cloud-based backup services by acquiring BitLeap.[48]
In November 2008, Barracuda Networks acquired 3SP, allowing the company to introduce Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Network (VPN) products to allow secure remote access to network file shares, internal Web sites and remote control capabilities for desktops and servers.[49]
In January 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Yosemite Technologies to add software agents for incremental backups of applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server, and Windows system states.[41][50]
September 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired controlling interest in phion AG, an Austria-based public company delivering enterprise-class firewalls.[51]
In October 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Purewire Inc, a software as a service (SaaS) company offering cloud based web filtering and security.[52][53]
In April 2013, Barracuda Networks acquired SignNow.[54]
In 2014, Barracuda Networks purchased C2C Systems UK.[55]
In October 2015, Barracuda Networks acquired Intronis.[56]
Security Issue[edit]
In January 2013, a backdoor was discovered: "A variety of firewall, VPN, and spam filtering gear sold by Barracuda Networks contains undocumented backdoor accounts that allow people to remotely log in and access sensitive information, researchers with an Austrian security firm have warned." The backdoor was then secured shortly after the announcement.[57]

ArchiveOne


Barracuda ArchiveOne
Comprehensive Archiving, eDiscovery and Information Management Software

					Free Trial
				








									Overview
								







Overview

Information Management, Retention and Compliance Made Easy
Some of the most important information in your organization is contained in emails and documents that are often among thousands of mailboxes, network file servers and end-user devices. ArchiveOne gives you ownership and control over all of your import communication, documents and other unstructured data. ArchiveOne safely archives your emails and files, making it easy to comply with email retention policies and easy to find information no matter where it resides.
Built on a simple and flexible design, ArchiveOne gives your organization ownership and control over your data and offers a single solution for regulatory compliance, data retention and eDiscovery.
Simple and Scalable Architecture with Transparent Archiving of Files and Email

Integrates archiving, compliance policies, search and discovery in a single platform
Single search across live and archived data for files and email
Intuitive management console allows data to be managed by its business value
Scales to tens of thousands of mailboxes across multiple Exchange servers
Performance is improved and data backup time shortened
No change to the end user experience


ArchiveOne manages information across your organization, enabling compliance, ediscovery, capacity and PST management



Email Management with ArchiveOne
ArchiveOne is designed for the “real world” where email data resides not just in Exchange or Office 365, but also in PST files or end user systems, where it is not feasible to archive all data before enforcing retention policies or conducting search and discovery exercises.
ArchiveOne integrates seamlessly with Outlook and Outlook Web Access (OWA) for email management and the majority of customers are installed, configured and ready to archive in one day. End users can access archived data from their desktop and mobile devices – even when they are offline. 

File Management with ArchiveOne
ArchiveOne provides archiving and retrieval capabilities for files, giving you control over the ever increasing volume of documents and other important data.
There is no desktop software to be installed on client systems or user training required. Once you have installed ArchiveOne on your file server, users access their files in exactly the same way regardless of whether a file has been archived or not. If a user accesses a file that has been previously archived, the file is automatically retrieved and restored to its original location.

eDiscovery with ArchiveOne
ArchiveOne simplifies the identification and collection of email data. Designed specifically for use by in-house legal and business teams, it enables them to perform Early Case Assessment (ECA) for regulatory and legal challenges, as well as respond to Discovery and Freedom of Information (FOIA) requests.
 By supporting the first three stages of the EDRM framework, the need for an expensive litigation platform to conduct early assessments is eliminated. ArchiveOne uses familiar workflow and terminology, and is accessed via a web-based console, enabling business users to perform queries and collections, and to manage compliance capture, all without the involvement of IT staff.

Benefits







Rules-Based Archiving of Emails and Files
ArchiveOne automates your organization’s retention policies by letting you define which files, emails, attachments and calendar items should be archived and how long the data should be retained. Any data found in Exchange mailboxes, public folders, client PST files or network file servers can be automatically archived to any designated storage device.
You can define policies based on age, metadata, content and many other options. Your data retention criteria can be applied to files, messages and/or attachments. Alternatively, you can also archive email data via the Exchange Journal when all communications must be captured in order to meet regulatory demands.
Back to top  















Enforce Retention and Disposal Policies Even if Your Data is Not Archived
With ArchiveOne, you can apply retention policies, enforce legal holds and even dispose of emails and files without first archiving the data. This is highly efficient because it leverages the resources already in place and allows for rapid growth of your data without having to first add an archiving infrastructure. Administrators can easily identify, preserve and collect relevant data for internal investigations, information requests and litigation.

Enterprises
For an enterprise that has branch offices connecting to the headquarters, Virtual Leased Line (VLL) powered by Truffle SD-WAN appliance with Broadband Bonding technology provides a unique WAN bonding value proposition. With Truffle network appliances at the branch offices and at the headquarter, the branch offices will be able to bond together their various Internet access lines to create a virtual, secure, fast and reliable IP pipe to and from their headquarters, including VPN bonding. VLL is an ideal high performance alternative to MPLS and is highly cost effective. VLL can also be utilized to offload public Internet traffic off of MPLS when deployed along side with MPLS - generating huge savings in MPLS bandwidth cost. VLL is a very cost effective MPLS alternative.



Additionally, if the branch office Internet traffic is funneled through the headquarter (such as through a VPN), then the branch office will enjoy VPN bonding and the bonded speeds not only for the point-to-point connection to the headquarter, but also for the traffic to/from the public Internet. Optionally, the remote office public Internet traffic can be offloaded and bonded locally.

To learn more about Mushroom’s SD-WAN enterprise solution with WAN bonding technology, please contact us via email or phone.
Additional information about VLL and Truffle is available here - Virtual Leased Line for headquarter to branch office communications.

History[edit]
Barracuda Networks was founded in 2003 by Dean Drako (founding CEO), Michael Perone, and Zach Levow; the company introduced the Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall in the same year.[2][3][4] In 2007 the company moved its headquarters to Campbell, California,[5] and opened an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[6]
In January 2006, it closed its first outside investment of $40 million from Sequoia Capital and Francisco Partners.[7]
On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]
In 2012, the company became a co-sponsor of the Garmin-Barracuda UCI ProTour cycling team [18] and entitlement sponsor of the 2011 Indianapolis 500 champion Bryan Herta Autosport in the IZOD IndyCar Series, with the #98 Lotus driven by Alex Tagliani, who will defend the team's championship.[19]
Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space. In June, 2012, Barracuda signed a lease to occupy the 45,000 square foot office complex previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard St in downtown Ann Arbor.[21]
In July 2012, Dean Drako, Barracuda Networks’s co-founder, president and CEO since it was founded in 2003, resigned his operating position, remaining on the company’s board of directors.[22] At the time of Drako’s departure, the company stated it had achieved profitability,[23] a nearly ongoing 30 annual percent growth rate since inception, 150,000 customers worldwide, nearly 1,000 employees, 10 offices, and did business in 80 countries.[24] The company created the office of the CEO as it started a CEO search.[25]
In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.
In November 2013, Barracuda Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CUDA.[27]
In March 2015, Barracuda Networks expanded its business to North Asia and was distributed by TriTech Distribution Limited in Hong Kong.[28]
In November 2015, Barracuda added new Next Generation Firewall to its firewall family.[29]
Barracuda has announced future discontinuation of its Copy and CudaDrive services as of May 2016.[30]

The firewalls integrate web and email filtering, intrusion prevention, layer 7 application profiling, and network access control into one platform that is centrally managed across multiple distributed enterprise network locations.

In January 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Yosemite Technologies to add software agents for incremental backups of applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server, and Windows system states.[41][50]
September 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired controlling interest in phion AG, an Austria-based public company delivering enterprise-class firewalls.[51]

In October 2015, Barracuda Networks acquired Intronis.[56]
Security Issue[edit]
In January 2013, a backdoor was discovered: "A variety of firewall, VPN, and spam filtering gear sold by Barracuda Networks contains undocumented backdoor accounts that allow people to remotely log in and access sensitive information, researchers with an Austrian security firm have warned." The backdoor was then secured shortly after the announcement.[57]

History[edit]
Barracuda Networks was founded in 2003 by Dean Drako (founding CEO), Michael Perone, and Zach Levow; the company introduced the Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall in the same year.[2][3][4] In 2007 the company moved its headquarters to Campbell, California,[5] and opened an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[6]
In January 2006, it closed its first outside investment of $40 million from Sequoia Capital and Francisco Partners.[7]
On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]
In 2012, the company became a co-sponsor of the Garmin-Barracuda UCI ProTour cycling team [18] and entitlement sponsor of the 2011 Indianapolis 500 champion Bryan Herta Autosport in the IZOD IndyCar Series, with the #98 Lotus driven by Alex Tagliani, who will defend the team's championship.[19]
Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space. In June, 2012, Barracuda signed a lease to occupy the 45,000 square foot office complex previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard St in downtown Ann Arbor.[21]
In July 2012, Dean Drako, Barracuda Networks’s co-founder, president and CEO since it was founded in 2003, resigned his operating position, remaining on the company’s board of directors.[22] At the time of Drako’s departure, the company stated it had achieved profitability,[23] a nearly ongoing 30 annual percent growth rate since inception, 150,000 customers worldwide, nearly 1,000 employees, 10 offices, and did business in 80 countries.[24] The company created the office of the CEO as it started a CEO search.[25]
In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.
In November 2013, Barracuda Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CUDA.[27]
In March 2015, Barracuda Networks expanded its business to North Asia and was distributed by TriTech Distribution Limited in Hong Kong.[28]
In November 2015, Barracuda added new Next Generation Firewall to its firewall family.[29]
Barracuda has announced future discontinuation of its Copy and CudaDrive services as of May 2016.[30]

Message Archiver - In July 2007, the company introduced message archiving to index and preserve emails, and to meet legal and regulatory compliance.[36]

Web Security Service - In October 2009, in conjunction with its acquisition of Purewire, Barracuda Networks launched the Purewire Web Security Service which is a software as a service offering for Web filtering, content security, and safe web surfing.[42]
NextGen Firewall - In February 2010, Barracuda announced its NextGen Firewalls to protect enterprise network infrastructures. The firewalls integrate web and email filtering, intrusion prevention, layer 7 application profiling, and network access control into one platform that is centrally managed across multiple distributed enterprise network locations. NextGen Firewalls are available as a hardware appliance, virtual appliance and public cloud instance. The product includes wide area network traffic optimization.[43]
CudaTel Communication Server (PBX) - in August 2010, Barracuda announced the release of CudaTel, a VOIP Private branch exchange designed for IT administrators. CudaTel features FreeSWITCH, an open-source project sponsored by Barracuda Networks.[44]

In January 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Yosemite Technologies to add software agents for incremental backups of applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server, and Windows system states.[41][50]
September 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired controlling interest in phion AG, an Austria-based public company delivering enterprise-class firewalls.[51]
In October 2009, Barracuda Networks acquired Purewire Inc, a software as a service (SaaS) company offering cloud based web filtering and security.[52][53]
In April 2013, Barracuda Networks acquired SignNow.[54]
In 2014, Barracuda Networks purchased C2C Systems UK.[55]
In October 2015, Barracuda Networks acquired Intronis.[56]
Security Issue[edit]
In January 2013, a backdoor was discovered: "A variety of firewall, VPN, and spam filtering gear sold by Barracuda Networks contains undocumented backdoor accounts that allow people to remotely log in and access sensitive information, researchers with an Austrian security firm have warned." The backdoor was then secured shortly after the announcement.[57]

History[edit]
Barracuda Networks was founded in 2003 by Dean Drako (founding CEO), Michael Perone, and Zach Levow; the company introduced the Barracuda Spam and Virus Firewall in the same year.[2][3][4] In 2007 the company moved its headquarters to Campbell, California,[5] and opened an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[6]
In January 2006, it closed its first outside investment of $40 million from Sequoia Capital and Francisco Partners.[7]
On January 29, 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro over their use of the open source anti-virus software Clam AntiVirus, which Trend Micro claimed to be in violation of their patent on 'anti-virus detection on an SMTP or FTP gateway'.[8] In addition to providing samples of prior art in an effort to render Trend Micro's patent invalid, in July 2008 Barracuda launched a countersuit against Trend Micro claiming Trend Micro violated several antivirus patents Barracuda Networks had acquired from IBM.[9]
In December 2008, the company launched the BRBL (Barracuda Reputation Block List), its proprietary and dynamic list of known spam servers, for free and public use in blocking spam at the gateway.[10] Soon after opening BRBL many IP addresses got blacklisted without apparent reason and without any technical explanation.[11][12][13][14]
As of October 2009, Barracuda had over 85,000 customers.[15] As of November, 2011, Barracuda had more than 130,000 customers.[16] As of January, 2014, Barracuda has more than 150,000 customers worldwide.[17]
In 2012, the company became a co-sponsor of the Garmin-Barracuda UCI ProTour cycling team [18] and entitlement sponsor of the 2011 Indianapolis 500 champion Bryan Herta Autosport in the IZOD IndyCar Series, with the #98 Lotus driven by Alex Tagliani, who will defend the team's championship.[19]
Barracuda Networks expanded its research and development facility in Ann Arbor to a 12,500 square foot office building on Depot Street in 2008.[20] By 2012, the Michigan-based research division had grown to about 180 employees, again outgrowing its space. In June, 2012, Barracuda signed a lease to occupy the 45,000 square foot office complex previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard St in downtown Ann Arbor.[21]
In July 2012, Dean Drako, Barracuda Networks’s co-founder, president and CEO since it was founded in 2003, resigned his operating position, remaining on the company’s board of directors.[22] At the time of Drako’s departure, the company stated it had achieved profitability,[23] a nearly ongoing 30 annual percent growth rate since inception, 150,000 customers worldwide, nearly 1,000 employees, 10 offices, and did business in 80 countries.[24] The company created the office of the CEO as it started a CEO search.[25]
In November 2012, long-time EMC executive William "BJ" Jenkins joined the company as President and CEO.[26] Jenkins worked at EMC since 1998 and most recently served as president of EMC's Backup and Recovery Systems (BRS) Division.
In November 2013, Barracuda Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CUDA.[27]
In March 2015, Barracuda Networks expanded its business to North Asia and was distributed by TriTech Distribution Limited in Hong Kong.[28]
In November 2015, Barracuda added new Next Generation Firewall to its firewall family.[29]
Barracuda has announced future discontinuation of its Copy and CudaDrive services as of May 2016.[30]

In January 2013, a backdoor was discovered: "A variety of firewall, VPN, and spam filtering gear sold by Barracuda Networks contains undocumented backdoor accounts that allow people to remotely log in and access sensitive information, researchers with an Austrian security firm have warned." The backdoor was then secured shortly after the announcement.[57]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
