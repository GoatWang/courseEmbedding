About Cabinet Hardware

While some may not put too much thought into the workings of their kitchen and bathroom cabinets, there are actually quite a few different elements that need to come together for these types of storage spaces to function properly.
Latches, hinges, and drawer slides are all helpful accessories when installing or replacing cabinets and drawers. Latches keep cabinet doors firmly closed when they aren’t in use and come in a range of options, from simple spring-roller latches and magnetic-catch latches to more secure measures that feature child-safe mechanisms or even a lock and key. Hinges seem straightforward at first, but there are a wide variety of styles and shapes to accommodate any cabinet style or preference. Drawer slides are hardware pieces that allow a drawer to slide in and out of its closed position. These also come in a few different styles that include smooth ball bearing slides, soft-close slides and full-extension variations.
Cabinet knobs and pulls are great accessories that put the fun in functional hardware. They come in thousands of sizes, styles and shapes to bring the perfect look to a space. Cabinet hardware can also be a great way to breathe new life into an old piece of furniture; new pulls and a fresh coat of paint can update or refurbish any dresser, nightstand or accent cabinet.
To give a drawer or cabinet a more decorative appearance, you can also add a backplate behind the knob or pull. Backplates protect the cabinet surface around the knob from wear, offer even more opportunity for embellishment and can help cover up holes from prior hardware.

    Bringing out the best in your windows can be as simple as upgrading your window hardware and treatments. Whether you are looking to make your windows stand
    out with bold coverings, blend in with complementing hardware, or keep the light out with blackout curtains, themine.com has what you need.


    Before you can hang any curtains, drapes, or valances, you need to have a fixture from which to hang them. That’s where our enormous selection of drapery
    hardware comes in. We offer nearly 700 different options of curtain rods, brackets, and tie backs that can support the window treatments of your choice. We
    even carry hard to find specialty widow hardware such as double curtain rods, elegant cornices, and bay window curtain rods. And to top these off, we also
    offer stylish curtain rod finials that can add a classic, themed, or distinctive touch to the end of any curtain rod.


    Once you have the hardware settled, we provide an extensive selection of every type, material, color, and pattern of window coverings you could want. From
    sheers to black out curtains and every drapes option in between, we have the ideal window treatments for your space. If privacy and lighting control are
    your primary concerns with window coverings, you may also want to take a look at our selection of blinds and window shades. These are adjustable
    installations that can be used separately or in conjunction with curtains or other window treatments. Blinds and shades can come in a variety of neutral
    colors and finishes, or add to décor with expressive prints and patterns.


    Another thing to consider when outfitting your windows is your house’s security. When it comes to keeping your home safe, windows are a crucial point to
    secure. We offer a variety of options to help keep windows protected from intruders, including latches, window locks, slide stops, and security bars. Any
    of these choices can be helpful additions that make a home less likely to be victim to a crime of opportunity.
