401(k) Retirement Plans










American Funds offers a variety of 401(k) plan solutions and investment options to help employers and investors meet their needs. To find out which options are best for you, talk to your company’s financial professional.
Any employer, except government entities, can offer a 401(k) plan. Here are the basics of 401(k) plans, although plan rules may vary:








Collapse All



  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.


Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings.
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*


* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  







The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are determined by the employer, who may get help from the plan's financial professional or a third-party fiduciary. Participants can decide which of the options to use. 







American Funds Portfolio SeriesSM



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth. 











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary contributions into participant accounts.







  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their salary-deferral contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.







  Distributions  







Distributions from 401(k) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, plans may allow ways to access 401(k) money early. 







  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:


Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 401(k) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties. 

To learn more about your options, contact your financial professional.

Traditional vs. Roth 401(k)/403(b) Analyzer









Which option is better for you?
If your 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan accepts both traditional and Roth contributions, you have two ways to save for your retirement. Both offer federal income tax advantages.
Traditional accounts provide a tax break now. Traditional contributions are not taxed at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid on withdrawals, including any earnings. Getting a tax break at the time of investment will leave more money in your pocket now — money that you can invest, save or spend.
Roth accounts provide a tax advantage later. Roth contributions are made with money that’s already been taxed, so you won’t have to pay taxes on qualified withdrawals, including earnings.
Enter your personal information to compare the results of traditional before-tax savings and Roth after-tax savings. You can click each  for help.










Annual Retirement Plan Contribution

Contribution Limits
The annual IRS contribution limit is $18,000 for 2017 ($24,000 for investors 50 and older).






Years to Invest Until Retirement Plan Withdrawals Begin 









Withdrawing Money Soon? Go Traditional.
Roth accounts must be at least five years old before tax-free withdrawals can be taken. Traditional accounts don’t have a holding requirement.

Future Taxes: The Key Factor
Do you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement? Or do you think tax rates overall will be higher?



























Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.




Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans that accept both Roth and traditional contributions can contribute either type or a combination of both. With traditional accounts, withdrawals of pretax contributions and earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if taken before age 59-1/2. Qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the first Roth contribution was made at least five years before, and if you are at least 59-1/2, are disabled or have died. For nonqualified distributions from Roth accounts, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. IRS contribution limits are adjusted for inflation in $500 increments.
Future tax rates may change. The analyzer applies tax rates to all taxable income. When estimating your future tax rate, you should consider whether the amount of taxable distributions might push you into a higher tax bracket.
Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Hypothetical annual rates of return are not intended to reflect actual results; your results may vary based on market conditions. The analyzer compounds earnings monthly and assumes that withdrawals are made at the beginning of the year. The analyzer does not take certain factors into account, including state and local taxes, required minimum distributions and holding periods, early withdrawal penalties, matching contributions, previous retirement plan contributions and IRS withdrawal rules. Be sure to consult with a financial professional or tax adviser to discuss your specific situation.
This analyzer is intended for use in making a rough comparison of Roth and traditional retirement plan accounts. We do not guarantee the accuracy of the results or their relevance to your particular circumstances. Results shown are hypothetical and are not intended to portray actual results. Your results will differ. We encourage you to seek the assistance of your financial professional.

Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.



Hypothetical growth calculations are not intended to reflect actual results; your results may vary.
This tool assumes the following: a hypothetical annual growth rate before retirement of 8%; a hypothetical annual growth rate in retirement of 6%; a hypothetical annual inflation rate of 4%; an expected annual salary raise of 3%; you’ll need 80% of your final salary each year in retirement; annual Social Security benefits of 40% of your final year of work (current salary adjusted for inflation and raises) up to the 2014 annual maximum of $31,704 per person; Social Security benefits are a constant amount beginning at age 67; and all money (which includes contributions and money already saved for retirement) is tax-deferred. Projected time in retirement is based on the remaining life expectancy after your planned retirement date (rounded to the nearest year). See IRS life expectancy tables.
The tool does not take certain factors into account, including early withdrawal penalties, required minimum distributions, holding periods and post-retirement income taxes (which may apply to certain investment income and withdrawals). The tool compounds earnings annually and assumes that withdrawals are made at the beginning of the year.
Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. This tool is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to provide investment advice or portray actual investment results. Your financial situation and goals may change, so be sure to discuss your results with your financial professional.
Investment allocations and underlying funds in the American Funds Target Date Retirement Series are updated quarterly. Underlying funds and their allocation percentages are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee’s discretion and will evolve over time. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. For quarterly updates of the underlying fund allocations, go to All Funds and then click on a target date fund name.
Most investments carry some degree of risk. For example, investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be greater with investments in developing countries. Investing in smaller companies also involves additional risks. Lower-rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal (than higher rated bonds). The return of principal in bond funds and for the bond holdings in New World Fund, Capital Income Builder, The Income Fund of America, American Balanced Fund, and American Funds Global Balanced Fund is not guaranteed. These fund shares are same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.

Any person with earned income who is under 70½.

A nonworking spouse under age 70½ who files a joint return that includes earned income.

If you’re age 50 or older, you can make an additional contribution of $1,000, for a total of $6,500.











Same as traditional IRA, subject to phase-out range depending on MAGI as explained in Eligibility.

















Deductible Contributions

 Single filer, covered by a retirement plan at work, with MAGI of:

$61,000 or less — fully deductible

Roth contributions are not tax-deductible.

















Tax Credit for Contributions











You can claim a nonrefundable tax credit for contributions if you are eligible.
The maximum credit allowed is 50% of the annual contribution amount up to $2,000, so long as your household income doesn’t exceed certain limits.
Joint filers with a MAGI of $62,000 or less in 2017 (or $61,500 in 2016) and single filers with a MAGI of $31,000 or less in 2017 (or $30,750 in 2016) qualify for the credit.











Same as traditional IRA.

















Federal Income-Tax Treatment on Contributions











Taxes are deferred until distributions are made; taxable distributions are treated as ordinary income.
Withdrawals of nondeductible contributions are not taxed.











Contributions are made with after-tax money; therefore, withdrawals from the contribution amount (basis amount) are tax-free.

















Federal Income-Tax Treatment on Earnings











Earnings grow tax-deferred until distributions begin. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income.












Qualified distributions are tax-free.
Nonqualified distributions: earnings are taxed as ordinary income and may be subject to a penalty.
Conversions: earnings are tax-free after the conversion amount satisfies the five-year investment period.

















Conversions











Conversion to a Roth IRA4: allowed, regardless of MAGI or tax filing status. The taxable portion of the converted amount will be treated as taxable income.












Recharacterizations: a Roth conversion can be undone (recharacterized) for any reason. You have until your tax filing deadline (including extensions) of the year you converted to a Roth IRA to undo your conversion.

















Rollovers











To employer-sponsored plans: pretax contributions can be rolled over to a 401(k) or to another qualified plan, as well as to 403(b) and 457(b) plans. However, the receiving plan must accept IRA rollovers.


From employer-sponsored plans: eligible pretax and after-tax distributions from qualified plans, as well as from 403(b) and 457(b) plans, can be rolled over.












From/to another Roth IRA: allowed.
From employer-sponsored plans: eligible Roth contributions and earnings in 401(k) and 403(b) plans can be rolled over. In addition, non-Roth balances can be rolled over. (See Conversions for more information.)

















Distributions5











Distributions from contributions and earnings can be taken after age 59½ without federal tax penalty.
 Mandatory withdrawals must begin no later than April 1 following the year you reach age 70½.
 Distributions before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty tax unless you qualify for one of the following exceptions under section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code:

you’re disabled 
you’re taking substantially equal periodic payments 
the distribution is for certain medical bills 
the distribution is used for health insurance premiums during unemployment lasting at least 12 weeks 
the distribution is for post-secondary education expenses 
the distribution is used to purchase a first home (up to $10,000 lifetime maximum)

Distributions to your beneficiaries are also exempt from the 10% penalty.















Distributions from contributions can be made any time without taxes or federal tax penalty.
Distributions from earnings are tax-free if your initial contribution to the account was made at least five years ago and you meet one of the following conditions:

you’re age 59½
you’re disabled
you’re purchasing a first home (up to $10,000 lifetime maximum)

Payments made to your beneficiaries after the five-year period are also tax and penalty free. Payments made before the end of the five-year period are penalty free.
Distributions from earnings are not subject to the 10% penalty as long as you qualify for an exception — same as exceptions for traditional IRAs.
Distributions from a conversion amount must satisfy a five-year investment period to avoid the 10% penalty. This pertains only to the conversion amount that was treated as income for tax purposes.

















Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)











You must begin taking RMDs no later than April 1 of the year following the year you turn 70½.

All of your IRA balances are aggregated for the purposes of calculating RMDs. Withdrawals may be taken from one or more IRAs.












No RMDs apply during your lifetime.













1 If you are eligible, you can contribute to both a traditional and Roth IRA as long as the combined amount does not exceed the applicable contribution limits shown in the table.
2 Your MAGI is calculated by subtracting certain expenses and allowable adjustments from your gross income. To determine your MAGI, contact your tax advisor or financial professional.
3 Future contribution limits may be adjusted for cost-of-living increases. Contributions for the current tax year must be made by April 15 of the following year, unless that date falls on a Saturday or Sunday.
4 Converting to a Roth IRA is a taxable event, and the rules and tax calculations can be complicated. State income-tax rules for conversions may differ from federal rules. We encourage you to discuss conversion options with your tax advisor or financial professional.
5 For beneficiaries, distribution rules vary depending on your age at death and the beneficiary‘s relationship to you. For help with distributions and tax-related issues, we encourageyou to talk to your personal tax advisor or legal professional.















You can learn more about traditional and Roth IRAs in IRS Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), and IRS Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). We also encourage you to discuss your financial goals, eligibility and individual tax situation with your tax advisor or financial professional.

403(b) Retirement Plans










A 403(b) is a tax-favored retirement plan similar to a 401(k) plan, but designed for employees of school systems, nonprofit hospitals, religious organizations and other tax-exempt employers, known as 501(c)(3) organizations.

Here are the basics of 403(b) plans, although plan rules may vary:


Participants may be able to make pretax or Roth contributions. Some organizations match these contributions.
Participant contributions are 100% immediately vested, but matching contributions may be subjected to a vesting schedule.








Collapse All



  Eligible Organizations  








Public education organizations, including primary and secondary schools, state colleges and universities and junior colleges
Nonprofit organizations, including hospitals, religious organizations, charitable institutions and social welfare agencies








  Eligible Employees  







After the first employee is permitted to participate, the employer must extend the offer to participate to all employees of the organization. The employer may exclude certain employees from the plan:

Employees who will contribute $200 or less annually
Nonresident aliens
Employees who work less than 20 hours per week
Employees who participate in a 401(k) or 457(b) plan or in another 403(b) plan
Students performing services described in Code 3121(b)(10) 







  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.

Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings. 
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*

* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  










The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are generally determined by the employer or the plan provisions, but participants can decide which of the options to use.
American Funds offers a wide range of investments.











American Funds Portfolio Series℠



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth.











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary (profit-sharing) contributions into participant accounts.






  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.






  Distributions  







Distributions from 403(b) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, there may be ways to access money early. 






  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:

Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 403(b) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties.

Creating a Financial Plan










The Value of a Financial Professional
Take advantage of your financial advisor’s experience and guidance.
Services Provided by Financial Professionals
Financial professionals provide many valuable services. They can help you:

Develop a long-term financial plan consistent with your time horizon, goals, financial situation and risk tolerance.
Analyze the risks and potential rewards of various investments.
Understand the value of a long-term investment perspective and a diversified asset mix spread among different asset classes, sectors and countries.
Build a portfolio that fits your needs, and monitor and change it over time.
Take advantage of investment manager services.

In addition, financial professionals will provide support and guidance during difficult times, such as:

Market downturns
Political turmoil
Wide interest rate or currency fluctuations
Personal financial stress

Working With a Financial Professional Could Help Improve Your Investment Outcome
If you think you can make good decisions on when to buy and sell on your own, consider that the statistics on the “do it yourself” approach are not encouraging.
Findings by Morningstar, a leading mutual fund research firm, compared mutual fund returns with the gains investors actually received. The study found that investor returns typically lagged fund returns.1 The reason: Investors tended to move cash in and out as markets would rise and fall, often buying high and selling low.
The study covered 10 years through the end of 2012, and found that funds posted an average annualized return of 7.05%, compared with a 6.1% average return realized by investors. (The returns factor in all stock and bond funds that Morningstar tracks. Investor returns are weighted based on asset flows into and out of all share classes of open-end mutual funds tracked by Morningstar.)
Although a gap of a single percentage point may not seem like a big difference, it can make a significant impact over the long term, thanks to compounding. In fact, a hypothetical $10,000 investment returning an average of 7.05% annually would produce a total of $19,856 over 10 years compared with $18,078 for an average annual return of 6.1% over the same period. Over 30 years, the gap becomes even wider: $78,286 for the 7.05% return vs. $59,082 for the 6.1% return.2







 Returns Based on a Hypothetical $10,000 Initial Investment 
















What is the reason for the gap between fund returns and investor returns? Financial researchers say the difference is largely attributable to investors buying funds when times are good and then selling when troubles arise. Once out of the market, investors often don’t get back in the market in time to capture much of the later upturn in stock prices.
Stock market volatility makes the problem worse. Fear can drive investors out of the market or cause them to make emotional decisions that could have long-term consequences for their portfolios. A financial advisor can help provide guidance during difficult times and help investors stay the course on their investment strategies.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

401(k) Retirement Plans










American Funds offers a variety of 401(k) plan solutions and investment options to help employers and investors meet their needs. To find out which options are best for you, talk to your company’s financial professional.
Any employer, except government entities, can offer a 401(k) plan. Here are the basics of 401(k) plans, although plan rules may vary:








Collapse All



  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.


Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings.
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*


* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  







The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are determined by the employer, who may get help from the plan's financial professional or a third-party fiduciary. Participants can decide which of the options to use. 







American Funds Portfolio SeriesSM



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth. 











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary contributions into participant accounts.







  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their salary-deferral contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.







  Distributions  







Distributions from 401(k) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, plans may allow ways to access 401(k) money early. 







  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:


Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 401(k) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties. 

To learn more about your options, contact your financial professional.

Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

It's never too soon to start thinking about retirement and building your retirement nest egg. Social Security and employer-sponsored pension plans may only provide a portion of the income you will need down the road.
As you approach retirement planning, you may have the following questions:

Are you on the right course to achieve your future financial goals?
What are your dreams for retirement?
Have you sufficiently planned for the security of your family?
Do you have an insurance professional to offer support and guidance?

These are just a few of the important questions to consider as you evaluate and plan what you need for a happy and prosperous financial future. These questions may seem a bit overwhelming, but remember you don’t have to figure out all the answers alone.
We offer you a variety of online resources to help you assess your current stage of life, calculate different financial scenarios and find an insurance professional who can be at your side. After identifying your needs, you can set your financial priorities with confidence and make effective financial decisions to achieve your goals.

401(k) Retirement Plans










American Funds offers a variety of 401(k) plan solutions and investment options to help employers and investors meet their needs. To find out which options are best for you, talk to your company’s financial professional.
Any employer, except government entities, can offer a 401(k) plan. Here are the basics of 401(k) plans, although plan rules may vary:








Collapse All



  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.


Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings.
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*


* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  







The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are determined by the employer, who may get help from the plan's financial professional or a third-party fiduciary. Participants can decide which of the options to use. 







American Funds Portfolio SeriesSM



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth. 











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary contributions into participant accounts.







  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their salary-deferral contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.







  Distributions  







Distributions from 401(k) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, plans may allow ways to access 401(k) money early. 







  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:


Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 401(k) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties. 

To learn more about your options, contact your financial professional.

Traditional vs. Roth 401(k)/403(b) Analyzer









Which option is better for you?
If your 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan accepts both traditional and Roth contributions, you have two ways to save for your retirement. Both offer federal income tax advantages.
Traditional accounts provide a tax break now. Traditional contributions are not taxed at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid on withdrawals, including any earnings. Getting a tax break at the time of investment will leave more money in your pocket now — money that you can invest, save or spend.
Roth accounts provide a tax advantage later. Roth contributions are made with money that’s already been taxed, so you won’t have to pay taxes on qualified withdrawals, including earnings.
Enter your personal information to compare the results of traditional before-tax savings and Roth after-tax savings. You can click each  for help.










Annual Retirement Plan Contribution

Contribution Limits
The annual IRS contribution limit is $18,000 for 2017 ($24,000 for investors 50 and older).






Years to Invest Until Retirement Plan Withdrawals Begin 









Withdrawing Money Soon? Go Traditional.
Roth accounts must be at least five years old before tax-free withdrawals can be taken. Traditional accounts don’t have a holding requirement.

Future Taxes: The Key Factor
Do you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement? Or do you think tax rates overall will be higher?



























Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.




Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans that accept both Roth and traditional contributions can contribute either type or a combination of both. With traditional accounts, withdrawals of pretax contributions and earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if taken before age 59-1/2. Qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the first Roth contribution was made at least five years before, and if you are at least 59-1/2, are disabled or have died. For nonqualified distributions from Roth accounts, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. IRS contribution limits are adjusted for inflation in $500 increments.
Future tax rates may change. The analyzer applies tax rates to all taxable income. When estimating your future tax rate, you should consider whether the amount of taxable distributions might push you into a higher tax bracket.
Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Hypothetical annual rates of return are not intended to reflect actual results; your results may vary based on market conditions. The analyzer compounds earnings monthly and assumes that withdrawals are made at the beginning of the year. The analyzer does not take certain factors into account, including state and local taxes, required minimum distributions and holding periods, early withdrawal penalties, matching contributions, previous retirement plan contributions and IRS withdrawal rules.

403(b) Retirement Plans










A 403(b) is a tax-favored retirement plan similar to a 401(k) plan, but designed for employees of school systems, nonprofit hospitals, religious organizations and other tax-exempt employers, known as 501(c)(3) organizations.

Here are the basics of 403(b) plans, although plan rules may vary:


Participants may be able to make pretax or Roth contributions. Some organizations match these contributions.
Participant contributions are 100% immediately vested, but matching contributions may be subjected to a vesting schedule.








Collapse All



  Eligible Organizations  








Public education organizations, including primary and secondary schools, state colleges and universities and junior colleges
Nonprofit organizations, including hospitals, religious organizations, charitable institutions and social welfare agencies








  Eligible Employees  







After the first employee is permitted to participate, the employer must extend the offer to participate to all employees of the organization. The employer may exclude certain employees from the plan:

Employees who will contribute $200 or less annually
Nonresident aliens
Employees who work less than 20 hours per week
Employees who participate in a 401(k) or 457(b) plan or in another 403(b) plan
Students performing services described in Code 3121(b)(10) 







  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.

Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings. 
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*

* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  










The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are generally determined by the employer or the plan provisions, but participants can decide which of the options to use.
American Funds offers a wide range of investments.











American Funds Portfolio Series℠



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth.











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary (profit-sharing) contributions into participant accounts.






  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.






  Distributions  







Distributions from 403(b) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, there may be ways to access money early. 






  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:

Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 403(b) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties.

Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.



Hypothetical growth calculations are not intended to reflect actual results; your results may vary.
This tool assumes the following: a hypothetical annual growth rate before retirement of 8%; a hypothetical annual growth rate in retirement of 6%; a hypothetical annual inflation rate of 4%; an expected annual salary raise of 3%; you’ll need 80% of your final salary each year in retirement; annual Social Security benefits of 40% of your final year of work (current salary adjusted for inflation and raises) up to the 2014 annual maximum of $31,704 per person; Social Security benefits are a constant amount beginning at age 67; and all money (which includes contributions and money already saved for retirement) is tax-deferred. Projected time in retirement is based on the remaining life expectancy after your planned retirement date (rounded to the nearest year). See IRS life expectancy tables.
The tool does not take certain factors into account, including early withdrawal penalties, required minimum distributions, holding periods and post-retirement income taxes (which may apply to certain investment income and withdrawals). The tool compounds earnings annually and assumes that withdrawals are made at the beginning of the year.
Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. This tool is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to provide investment advice or portray actual investment results. Your financial situation and goals may change, so be sure to discuss your results with your financial professional.
Investment allocations and underlying funds in the American Funds Target Date Retirement Series are updated quarterly. Underlying funds and their allocation percentages are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee’s discretion and will evolve over time. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. For quarterly updates of the underlying fund allocations, go to All Funds and then click on a target date fund name.
Most investments carry some degree of risk. For example, investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be greater with investments in developing countries. Investing in smaller companies also involves additional risks. Lower-rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal (than higher rated bonds). The return of principal in bond funds and for the bond holdings in New World Fund, Capital Income Builder, The Income Fund of America, American Balanced Fund, and American Funds Global Balanced Fund is not guaranteed. These fund shares are same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.

Good talent management means looking ahead, removing obstacles, and fostering excellence—no matter how big or small your business is.
Imagine being able to:

Recognize a new hire’s potential before they even start
Spot small holes in your organization’s talent before they become big ones
Chart a course for every employee that aligns with your company’s larger vision
Ensure that your best people grow – and stay – with you
Have a plan and a process for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including succession management






Lost productivity of actively disengaged employees costs the U.S. economy $370 billion annually.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
