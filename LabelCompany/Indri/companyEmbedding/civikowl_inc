The Democrats’ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the party’s commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Yoav brings a wealth of experience from an impressive track record of success in enterprise software.  Just as importantly, Yoav has a great attitude, yet still tells it like it is (i.e. direct and to the point).  Not to mention, Yoav's near-instantaneous response times are wholly unprecedented.  All of the foregoing, together, makes Yoav a well-suited advisor.

I got to know Yoav while working with him for 5 years at HubSpot, where he ran product and engineering.  We were both part of the founding team that grew the company from a few customers to thousands, and set it on a path to a successful IPO and beyond.Through his work at CarGurus, HubSpot, Happier and Jana, he has hired over 100 engineers, built products that ranged from easy to use consumer apps to powerful enterprise platforms, and created systems that support tens of millions of users.In 2016 Yoav was named "Best Technical Mentor" in TechStars Boston, which is no surprise because he has tons of experience that founders want to leverage, and he makes a lot of his time available to help the startup community.

I've known Yoav for a long-time.  His technical knowledge is impressive and his judgement on hiring, scaling, and culture to build a strong team as second to none.
