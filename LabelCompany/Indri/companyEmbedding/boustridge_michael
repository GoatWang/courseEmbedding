History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ciber was founded in 1974 by three individuals, one of whom would remain with the company and guide its fortunes for its crucial first two decades. Of the three original founders of Ciber, Bobby G. Stevenson emerged as the key figure in Ciber's history, shaping a start-up computer consulting firm into a leading national force by the 1990s, when the computer consulting industry was generating more than $30 billion worth of business a year. A graduate of Texas Tech University, Stevenson spent the years between his formal education and the formation of Ciber working as a programmer analyst for International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and LTV Steel in Houston. By the early 1970s, when Stevenson was in his early 30s, he and two other colleagues decided to make a go of it on their own and organized Ciber, an acronym for "consultants in business, engineering, and research."[3]
At the time, Stevenson and Ciber's other co-founders perceived a need in the corporate world for specialized, technical assistance in keeping pace with the technological advances in computer hardware and computer software. The trio saw an opportunity to provide contract computer consulting services to clients lacking either in the resources or the expertise to use the promising power of computers in their day-to-day operations. Through Ciber, the founders tapped into a market that would grow explosively in the decades ahead. Few realized at the time how important computers would become to the business world. As the use of computers increased and wave after wave of computer innovations swept away yesterday's technological vanguard, the need for sophisticated service firms like Ciber to implement the frequently indecipherable technology of tomorrow grew exponentially.[4]
Although Ciber entered the business of computer consulting services at a relatively early time, the company's physical and financial growth did not mirror the growth of its industry. Ciber grew at a modest pace initially, then embraced a new business strategy during the mid-1980s that ignited prolific growth. Stevenson watched over Ciber during both of the company's two eras, heading the company during its contrastingly slower period of growth and leading the charge during its decided rise during the 1990s.[5]
During Ciber's inaugural year of business, Stevenson served as the company's vice-president in charge of recruiting and managing the fledgling firm's technical staff, a post he would occupy until November 1977, when he was named Ciber's chief executive officer after the tragic accidental death of the CEO and Co-founder, Richard L. Ezinga. From late 1977 into the 1990s, Stevenson was responsible for all of Ciber's operations. At first, Stevenson and the two other co-founders targeted their consulting services exclusively to the automotive industry, establishing Ciber's first office in the hotbed of automotive production in the United States, Detroit, Michigan. Ciber did not remain wedded to the automotive industry for long, however. A few short years after its formation, Ciber began tailoring its services to the oil and gas industry as well, a move that occurred at roughly the same time as the company's geographic expansion. Two years after the company opened its doors in Detroit, an office in Phoenix was opened. A year later, in 1977, an office was established in Houston. A Denver office was opened in 1979, followed by the opening of a Dallas office in 1980 and an Atlanta office in 1987. The following year, Ciber relocated its corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado. While executive officers circulated throughout Ciber's Englewood facility, the company embarked on the most prolific growth period in its history to that point.[6]
1980s[edit]
A year after the move to Englewood and 15 years after its founding, Ciber competed in the burgeoning industry of computer consulting services as a minor player. Total sales in 1989 amounted to a mere $13 million, small change when compared with the revenue volume generated by the country's leading computer consulting firms. By this point, however, Ciber executives were plotting an era of dramatic growth for their company. During the mid-1980s, Stevenson and other Ciber executives adopted a new growth strategy that focused on the development of a new range of services and the realization of both physical and financial growth through the acquisition of established computer consulting firms. Although the strategy embraced during the mid-1980s would take half a decade to manifest itself in any meaningful way, once the strategy for the future began to take shape in tangible form, Ciber began its resolute rise to the upper echelon of its industry.[7]
By the end of 1989, when annual sales had slipped past the $10 million mark, the plans formulated midway through the decade moved from the drawing board to implementation. Ciber's expansion in 1990 included the opening of offices in Cleveland, Orlando, and Tampa, moves that were associated with the development of new clientele in the telecommunications industry. As Ciber focused its marketing efforts toward telecommunications providers during the early 1990s, securing contracts with industry giants such as AT&T, GTE, and U.S. West Communications, Inc., the company found itself occupying fertile ground in the computer consulting market. Not only were computers and their technology becoming increasingly sophisticated, progressing at a pace that demanded the help of experts such as Ciber's consultants, but the shifting dynamics of the corporate world also favored companies like Ciber.[8]
The early years of the 1990s were marked by a national economic recession that forced many of the country's corporations to alter their business strategies. As business declined and profit margins shrank, downsizing became the mantra of business leaders from coast to coast. Payroll was trimmed, entire departments were cut from corporate budgets, and, as a consequence, many companies found themselves lacking the resources and skills to perform certain tasks in-house, creating a greater need for the specialized services offered by Ciber. To meet this demand, Ciber contracted out specialists to help the nation's largest corporations complete computer projects and cope with hardware and software problems as they arose. Ciber consultants wrote and maintained software that performed a host of chores, including inventory control, accounts payable, and customer support.[9]
Although the conditions were ripe for rapid growth as the 1990s began, Ciber's stature at the start of the decade prohibited it to a certain degree from capturing a sizable share of the computer consulting market. The company was too small to realize the growth potential that surrounded it. Mac J. Slingerlend, who joined the company in 1989 as executive vice-president and chief financial officer before being named president and chief operating officer in 1996, reflected on Ciber's diminutive size years after the company had grown into a genuine national contender, noting, "We wanted to be a survivor. We were the smallest national player, and we needed to get larger quickly."[10]
1990s[edit]
Getting larger quickly ranked as Ciber's chief objective during the first half of the 1990s, engendering a period of growth that lifted the company's revenue volume from the $13 million recorded when Slingerlend joined the company to more than $150 million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer. Growth was achieved largely by purchasing established computer consulting firms, as Ciber embarked on an acquisition program that ranked it as the most active computer consulting acquirer in the nation during the first half of the 1990s. More than a dozen acquisitions were completed in six years' time, adding more than $70 million to the company's revenue base and greatly increasing the Colorado-based firm's national presence. Equally as important as the growth achieved through acquisition was the added expertise Ciber gained by swallowing up established computer consulting firms. During the 1990s, the push was on to grow larger quickly and to gain personnel that would enable Ciber to tackle more complex projects. Instead of just writing programs tailored to the specifications of its clients, Ciber executives were endeavoring to create a consulting firm that could identify problems and provide solutions, a transformation that would propel the company into the market for higher-margin services.[11]
The majority of the acquisitions that helped Ciber expand its services and broaden its national presence were completed after the company's initial public offering of stock in March 1994. Once the company converted to public ownership (Stevenson retained control of more than 50 percent of the company's shares), acquisitions followed in steady succession. In June 1994, Ciber acquired all of the business operations of $16-million-in-sales C.P.U., Inc. for approximately $10 million. Based in Rochester, New York, C.P.U. operated as a computer consulting firm employing 190 consultants in six branch offices and served clients such as Northern Telecom and Xerox Corporation. The C.P.U. acquisition was Ciber's fifth of the decade and by far the largest. In the coming two years, as expansion picked up pace, annual sales more than doubled, and the company's net income, inflated by the move into more complex, higher-margin services, nearly quadrupled.[12]
Following the C.P.U. acquisition, Ciber purchased Holmdel, New Jersey-based Interface Systems, Inc., a systems-consulting firm with 48 consultants and $5 million in annual revenue. Interface Systems was acquired in January 1995 and was followed by the May 1995 acquisition of Spencer & Spencer Systems, Inc., a 141-consultant, $13-million-in-sales computer programming provider with offices in St. Louis and Indianapolis. Next, in June 1995, Ciber reached across to the West Coast and acquired Concord, California-based Business Information Technology, Inc., a five-branch, 125-consultant computer consulting firm with $20 million in annual sales. A fourth acquisition was completed before the end of 1995 when Ciber purchased Broadway & Seymour, Inc., its Rochester, Minnesota office, and its 45 consultants. By the end of 1995, sales had increased from the $79.8 million generated in 1994 to more than $120 million, and company executives were set to launch Ciber's CIBR2000 division, a venture representative of the company's desire to provide more complex, higher-margin services.[13]
Introduced in December 1995, CIBR2000 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wide-ranging ramifications. Many software programs written between the 1960s and 1990s used a two-digit date format to record calendar dates, thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after 11:59:59 p.m., December 31, 1999. Without the ability to recognize "00" as the beginning of the new century, computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control, invoices, interest payments, pension payments, contract expirations, license and lease renewals, and myriad other tasks would generate false reports, create computer "bugs," and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns, all under the presumption that "00" signified the year 1900. Ciber's CIBR2000 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 1990s.[14]
At the time CIBR2000 service was being introduced, Ciber employed roughly 1,800 consultants and operated 28 branch offices scattered throughout the country. More than half of the company's sales was derived from 20 clients, including industry stalwarts such as American Express Company, AT&T, Ford Motor Company, IBM, MCI Telecommunications, Mellon Bank, Monsanto Corp., U.S. West Communications, Inc., and Xerox Corporation.
On the acquisition front, 1996 proved to be a busy year, eclipsing the achievements of 1995. In March, the company acquired Columbus, Ohio-based OASYS, Inc., a provider of contract computer programming services that gave Ciber a new geographic location in Columbus supported by 20 information technology consultants. In May 1996, Ciber acquired Practical Business Solutions, Inc., an information technology company with offices in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. Two months later, the company completed yet another acquisition, purchasing the Business Systems Development division of DataFocus, Inc., a computer consulting firm with offices in Fairfax, Virginia and Edison, New Jersey. Not stopping there, Ciber brought another company under its corporate umbrella in September, when it acquired Spectrum Technology Group, Inc., a management consulting firm based in Somerville, New Jersey that strengthened Ciber's management consulting and project management services.[15]

1990s[edit]
Getting larger quickly ranked as Ciber's chief objective during the first half of the 1990s, engendering a period of growth that lifted the company's revenue volume from the $13 million recorded when Slingerlend joined the company to more than $150 million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer.

Following the C.P.U. acquisition, Ciber purchased Holmdel, New Jersey-based Interface Systems, Inc., a systems-consulting firm with 48 consultants and $5 million in annual revenue. Interface Systems was acquired in January 1995 and was followed by the May 1995 acquisition of Spencer & Spencer Systems, Inc., a 141-consultant, $13-million-in-sales computer programming provider with offices in St. Louis and Indianapolis. Next, in June 1995, Ciber reached across to the West Coast and acquired Concord, California-based Business Information Technology, Inc., a five-branch, 125-consultant computer consulting firm with $20 million in annual sales. A fourth acquisition was completed before the end of 1995 when Ciber purchased Broadway & Seymour, Inc., its Rochester, Minnesota office, and its 45 consultants. By the end of 1995, sales had increased from the $79.8 million generated in 1994 to more than $120 million, and company executives were set to launch Ciber's CIBR2000 division, a venture representative of the company's desire to provide more complex, higher-margin services.[13]
Introduced in December 1995, CIBR2000 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wide-ranging ramifications. Many software programs written between the 1960s and 1990s used a two-digit date format to record calendar dates, thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after 11:59:59 p.m., December 31, 1999. Without the ability to recognize "00" as the beginning of the new century, computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control, invoices, interest payments, pension payments, contract expirations, license and lease renewals, and myriad other tasks would generate false reports, create computer "bugs," and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns, all under the presumption that "00" signified the year 1900. Ciber's CIBR2000 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 1990s.[14]
At the time CIBR2000 service was being introduced, Ciber employed roughly 1,800 consultants and operated 28 branch offices scattered throughout the country. More than half of the company's sales was derived from 20 clients, including industry stalwarts such as American Express Company, AT&T, Ford Motor Company, IBM, MCI Telecommunications, Mellon Bank, Monsanto Corp., U.S. West Communications, Inc., and Xerox Corporation.
On the acquisition front, 1996 proved to be a busy year, eclipsing the achievements of 1995. In March, the company acquired Columbus, Ohio-based OASYS, Inc., a provider of contract computer programming services that gave Ciber a new geographic location in Columbus supported by 20 information technology consultants. In May 1996, Ciber acquired Practical Business Solutions, Inc., an information technology company with offices in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. Two months later, the company completed yet another acquisition, purchasing the Business Systems Development division of DataFocus, Inc., a computer consulting firm with offices in Fairfax, Virginia and Edison, New Jersey. Not stopping there, Ciber brought another company under its corporate umbrella in September, when it acquired Spectrum Technology Group, Inc., a management consulting firm based in Somerville, New Jersey that strengthened Ciber's management consulting and project management services.[15]

Ciber, Inc. is a global information technology consulting, services and outsourcing company with commercial clients.
The company was founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1974 by Bobby Stevenson and two additional partners. They called the company Consultants in Business Engineering Research (Ciber). In May 2017, HTC Global Services acquired Ciber.[1][2]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ciber was founded in 1974 by three individuals, one of whom would remain with the company and guide its fortunes for its crucial first two decades. Of the three original founders of Ciber, Bobby G. Stevenson emerged as the key figure in Ciber's history, shaping a start-up computer consulting firm into a leading national force by the 1990s, when the computer consulting industry was generating more than $30 billion worth of business a year. A graduate of Texas Tech University, Stevenson spent the years between his formal education and the formation of Ciber working as a programmer analyst for International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and LTV Steel in Houston. By the early 1970s, when Stevenson was in his early 30s, he and two other colleagues decided to make a go of it on their own and organized Ciber, an acronym for "consultants in business, engineering, and research."[3]
At the time, Stevenson and Ciber's other co-founders perceived a need in the corporate world for specialized, technical assistance in keeping pace with the technological advances in computer hardware and computer software. The trio saw an opportunity to provide contract computer consulting services to clients lacking either in the resources or the expertise to use the promising power of computers in their day-to-day operations. Through Ciber, the founders tapped into a market that would grow explosively in the decades ahead. Few realized at the time how important computers would become to the business world. As the use of computers increased and wave after wave of computer innovations swept away yesterday's technological vanguard, the need for sophisticated service firms like Ciber to implement the frequently indecipherable technology of tomorrow grew exponentially.[4]
Although Ciber entered the business of computer consulting services at a relatively early time, the company's physical and financial growth did not mirror the growth of its industry. Ciber grew at a modest pace initially, then embraced a new business strategy during the mid-1980s that ignited prolific growth. Stevenson watched over Ciber during both of the company's two eras, heading the company during its contrastingly slower period of growth and leading the charge during its decided rise during the 1990s.[5]
During Ciber's inaugural year of business, Stevenson served as the company's vice-president in charge of recruiting and managing the fledgling firm's technical staff, a post he would occupy until November 1977, when he was named Ciber's chief executive officer after the tragic accidental death of the CEO and Co-founder, Richard L. Ezinga. From late 1977 into the 1990s, Stevenson was responsible for all of Ciber's operations. At first, Stevenson and the two other co-founders targeted their consulting services exclusively to the automotive industry, establishing Ciber's first office in the hotbed of automotive production in the United States, Detroit, Michigan. Ciber did not remain wedded to the automotive industry for long, however. A few short years after its formation, Ciber began tailoring its services to the oil and gas industry as well, a move that occurred at roughly the same time as the company's geographic expansion. Two years after the company opened its doors in Detroit, an office in Phoenix was opened. A year later, in 1977, an office was established in Houston. A Denver office was opened in 1979, followed by the opening of a Dallas office in 1980 and an Atlanta office in 1987. The following year, Ciber relocated its corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado. While executive officers circulated throughout Ciber's Englewood facility, the company embarked on the most prolific growth period in its history to that point.[6]
1980s[edit]
A year after the move to Englewood and 15 years after its founding, Ciber competed in the burgeoning industry of computer consulting services as a minor player. Total sales in 1989 amounted to a mere $13 million, small change when compared with the revenue volume generated by the country's leading computer consulting firms. By this point, however, Ciber executives were plotting an era of dramatic growth for their company. During the mid-1980s, Stevenson and other Ciber executives adopted a new growth strategy that focused on the development of a new range of services and the realization of both physical and financial growth through the acquisition of established computer consulting firms. Although the strategy embraced during the mid-1980s would take half a decade to manifest itself in any meaningful way, once the strategy for the future began to take shape in tangible form, Ciber began its resolute rise to the upper echelon of its industry.[7]
By the end of 1989, when annual sales had slipped past the $10 million mark, the plans formulated midway through the decade moved from the drawing board to implementation. Ciber's expansion in 1990 included the opening of offices in Cleveland, Orlando, and Tampa, moves that were associated with the development of new clientele in the telecommunications industry. As Ciber focused its marketing efforts toward telecommunications providers during the early 1990s, securing contracts with industry giants such as AT&T, GTE, and U.S. West Communications, Inc., the company found itself occupying fertile ground in the computer consulting market. Not only were computers and their technology becoming increasingly sophisticated, progressing at a pace that demanded the help of experts such as Ciber's consultants, but the shifting dynamics of the corporate world also favored companies like Ciber.[8]
The early years of the 1990s were marked by a national economic recession that forced many of the country's corporations to alter their business strategies. As business declined and profit margins shrank, downsizing became the mantra of business leaders from coast to coast. Payroll was trimmed, entire departments were cut from corporate budgets, and, as a consequence, many companies found themselves lacking the resources and skills to perform certain tasks in-house, creating a greater need for the specialized services offered by Ciber. To meet this demand, Ciber contracted out specialists to help the nation's largest corporations complete computer projects and cope with hardware and software problems as they arose. Ciber consultants wrote and maintained software that performed a host of chores, including inventory control, accounts payable, and customer support.[9]
Although the conditions were ripe for rapid growth as the 1990s began, Ciber's stature at the start of the decade prohibited it to a certain degree from capturing a sizable share of the computer consulting market. The company was too small to realize the growth potential that surrounded it. Mac J. Slingerlend, who joined the company in 1989 as executive vice-president and chief financial officer before being named president and chief operating officer in 1996, reflected on Ciber's diminutive size years after the company had grown into a genuine national contender, noting, "We wanted to be a survivor. We were the smallest national player, and we needed to get larger quickly."[10]
1990s[edit]
Getting larger quickly ranked as Ciber's chief objective during the first half of the 1990s, engendering a period of growth that lifted the company's revenue volume from the $13 million recorded when Slingerlend joined the company to more than $150 million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer. Growth was achieved largely by purchasing established computer consulting firms, as Ciber embarked on an acquisition program that ranked it as the most active computer consulting acquirer in the nation during the first half of the 1990s. More than a dozen acquisitions were completed in six years' time, adding more than $70 million to the company's revenue base and greatly increasing the Colorado-based firm's national presence. Equally as important as the growth achieved through acquisition was the added expertise Ciber gained by swallowing up established computer consulting firms. During the 1990s, the push was on to grow larger quickly and to gain personnel that would enable Ciber to tackle more complex projects. Instead of just writing programs tailored to the specifications of its clients, Ciber executives were endeavoring to create a consulting firm that could identify problems and provide solutions, a transformation that would propel the company into the market for higher-margin services.[11]
The majority of the acquisitions that helped Ciber expand its services and broaden its national presence were completed after the company's initial public offering of stock in March 1994. Once the company converted to public ownership (Stevenson retained control of more than 50 percent of the company's shares), acquisitions followed in steady succession. In June 1994, Ciber acquired all of the business operations of $16-million-in-sales C.P.U., Inc. for approximately $10 million. Based in Rochester, New York, C.P.U. operated as a computer consulting firm employing 190 consultants in six branch offices and served clients such as Northern Telecom and Xerox Corporation. The C.P.U. acquisition was Ciber's fifth of the decade and by far the largest. In the coming two years, as expansion picked up pace, annual sales more than doubled, and the company's net income, inflated by the move into more complex, higher-margin services, nearly quadrupled.[12]
Following the C.P.U. acquisition, Ciber purchased Holmdel, New Jersey-based Interface Systems, Inc., a systems-consulting firm with 48 consultants and $5 million in annual revenue. Interface Systems was acquired in January 1995 and was followed by the May 1995 acquisition of Spencer & Spencer Systems, Inc., a 141-consultant, $13-million-in-sales computer programming provider with offices in St. Louis and Indianapolis. Next, in June 1995, Ciber reached across to the West Coast and acquired Concord, California-based Business Information Technology, Inc., a five-branch, 125-consultant computer consulting firm with $20 million in annual sales. A fourth acquisition was completed before the end of 1995 when Ciber purchased Broadway & Seymour, Inc., its Rochester, Minnesota office, and its 45 consultants. By the end of 1995, sales had increased from the $79.8 million generated in 1994 to more than $120 million, and company executives were set to launch Ciber's CIBR2000 division, a venture representative of the company's desire to provide more complex, higher-margin services.[13]
Introduced in December 1995, CIBR2000 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wide-ranging ramifications. Many software programs written between the 1960s and 1990s used a two-digit date format to record calendar dates, thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after 11:59:59 p.m., December 31, 1999. Without the ability to recognize "00" as the beginning of the new century, computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control, invoices, interest payments, pension payments, contract expirations, license and lease renewals, and myriad other tasks would generate false reports, create computer "bugs," and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns, all under the presumption that "00" signified the year 1900. Ciber's CIBR2000 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 1990s.[14]
At the time CIBR2000 service was being introduced, Ciber employed roughly 1,800 consultants and operated 28 branch offices scattered throughout the country. More than half of the company's sales was derived from 20 clients, including industry stalwarts such as American Express Company, AT&T, Ford Motor Company, IBM, MCI Telecommunications, Mellon Bank, Monsanto Corp., U.S. West Communications, Inc., and Xerox Corporation.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Greetings and welcome to the Ciber Inc. First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Scott Kozak, Direct of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Kozak. You may begin.
Scott Kozak
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. My name is Scott Kozak, Senior Director of Investor Relations at Ciber. Welcome to Ciber’s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Michael Boustridge, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Christian Mezger, our CFO.
Before turning the call over to Michael, I will remind you that some of our prepared comments and responses to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those factors set forth in today’s news release and discussed under the risk factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as other SEC filings.
Also during this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. We have included reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures in our news release and on the Investor Relations section of our website, ciber.com. Today’s discussion will be on a continuing operations basis. Please refer to our SEC filings on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and 8-K for a recap of historical comparisons.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ciber’s President and CEO, Michael Boustridge. Michael?
Michael Boustridge
Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call. Although there were several positive developments in our first quarter, this was a challenging period for Ciber reflecting the ongoing impact of issues I have discussed with you before, largely involving the time it is taking our company to recover from years of under investment in key businesses and new offerings
Although second quarter revenues and profits were likely to be impacted as well, our continued focus in these areas has begun to show meaningful improvement and bookings and I remain confident that our second half will show topline results and good profitability.
In the first quarter, we continued to benefit from backlog in North America reflecting weaker bookings during the first half of 2015. I will talk more in a moment about what we believe is a positive turning point for those bookings.
Reflecting recent industry trends involving [Indiscernible] compression we also absorbed pricing pressure from some of our largest customers as we successfully retained their business. We also faced pressures in our international business where 2015 bookings were below 2014 levels throughout most of the last year leaving us with fewer revenue opportunities early in 2016.
In addition, business in the U.K. has not recovered quickly as we expected and we are facing what we believe are short terms staffing recruitment issues in some of our larger country markets. I will return to these issues later in my comments.
Looking forward, we believe Ciber’s current pipeline bookings and book-to-bill ratios will lead to better revenue results in the second half of the year. Our pipeline of qualified opportunities which we consider cross based [ph] closing to become sign deals [ph] grew 8% sequentially in the first quarter, providing a good indication of our market stabilization.

Going forward, I will provide bookings rather than pipeline to give you a sense of the revenue momentum. I told you that I would provide net process that became comfortable with that company’s ability to produce and forecast them accurately. And I bring bookings to be as best indicator of our future performance.
First quarter 2016 marked one of our strongest year-over-year bookings increases in recent periods. These gains were driven by investment in product development, sales and marketing as well as last year’s portfolio of rationalization effort.
Ciber’s first quarter bookings which included signed customer contract is fixed to produce revenue in the near future rose 6% year-over-year. Bookings were particularly strong in North America. These increased bookings led to a one to one book-to-bill ratio in North America in the first quarter and 1.0 internationally. This is the first period where we have achieved an international book-to-bill ratio at or above one since the fourth quarter of 2014.
We expect increased year-over-year bookings and book-to-bill ratios at around or above 1.0 in the first half providing the foundation of Ciber to achieve future revenue growth and marginal improvement.
The time it take bookings to float a revenue obviously differs from different types of business though we estimate that more than half of their bookings will flow to the topline sometime in fiscal 2016.
As I have said many times, we understand that our company must resume its past to revenue growth in order to increase margins, expand profit and generate greater levels of cash. We took actions in 2015 to accomplish these results including focussing on our core offerings and despite tightly defined colors, solidifying our reputation in the fast growing cloud implementation and reducing Ciber momentum and delivering on our Ciber transformation services model.
We also have instructed Ciber’s board of directors to appoint members who had the deep technology expertise, business strategy and customer focus needed to achieve our primary objective of delivering long term growth and enhanced share holder value.
I will leave the detailed discussion of the reported results to Christian. I particularly wanted to highlight efforts outside the Ciber momentum. As we believe industry rich portfolio solutions to our verticals like retail, utilities and local government will also produce good return.
As one example, we are introducing an in the box concept for retail utility. This product enables companies to offer new, disruptive business proposition to the customers with time to view [ph] spilling and dynamic retail pricing.
We expect strong interest for customers that want to adapt a pay as you go model in the cloud to avoid heavy start up cost and back office application. Another example is our go-to-market strategy around digitalization in the retail industry.
Amongst other features this strategy provides businesses with access to long term information about the customer’s behaviour. A case in point is a retail template implementation for this year, a German retail housekeeper provider that is part of the Mackeson [ph].
Our produce scope included a phase 1 implementation in Norway which is already completed and phase 2 which when completes [ph] implementations in the U.K. and Germany. When complete, the Ciber implementation would allow [Indiscernible] to implement benefits from one global ERP Solutions such as having one consolidated view of their financial performance in all countries and optimizing the worldwide purchases.
Over the last 12 months we’ve also been working to standardise outdated legacy bonus plans in Europe. Ciber is moving towards globally aligned compensation systems that will allow our employees to next March payout tied to our company performance. As we carry out the challenging but necessary program changes, we are experiencing higher than normal employee turnover, which will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue growth and profitability.

We started this work in early 2015. This is not an easy transition as we focus on the quality of service to our customers who are balancing the needs of our employees who are critical to the success of our company. Let me turn now to an update on Ciber momentum.
Market reaction to the talk [ph] continues to be strong; importantly we are finding that modernization is not just the legacy application. Technology changes are appearing so quickly that even systems less than 10 years old need to be modernized to use the cloud. We have 19 Ciber invented proof-of-concept POCs in the market at present and we expect several additional POCs such as the engagement in Europe we announced in April that will generate fees to contribute to Ciber’s topline.
We believe these POCs proved it to works [ph] and are opening new opportunities for Ciber Momentum. For instance, the Ciber Momentum subscription that we signed in February partnering with a large diversified industrial company is executing well. We have provided great value to the customer demonstrating that the tool can accelerate and automate some important modernization script. A customer has just increased a modernization project with us for an additional $1.7 million engagement in managed services.
We expect that the customer will expand the Ciber Momentum engineering subscription to support that modernization effort. Our international transaction evolves the paid proof-of-concept for the European bank.
We are optimistic that we have signed an engagement to modernized and migrate their first application to a private cloud. Ciber Transformation Services also making an important progress in the large scale labor talent reengineering market.
Our first engagement is proceeding well with high customer satisfaction and the experience we've gain from this transaction pass the way for more extensive product launch.
Importantly, customers that tell us that Ciber Momentum and Ciber Transformation Services providing unique sales proposition, we will combined these offerings, we help our customers modernize both the legacy applications and their workforce.
Our investment effort continues, we added $2 million in the first quarter to the $7 million of spend over the prior 15 months to support product development marketing expenditures, proof-of-concept and start up cost behind our key offerings.
Ciber Momentum spending in particular remains on track to reach $5 million in 2016 up $1.5 million last year. These investments are absolutely critical to generate revenue streams beyond Ciber's legacy staffing and implementation business.
In addition to a keen focus on revenue growth we'll remain committed to controlling our GA overhead costs. When I spoke with you at -- I said that we will reduce GA expenses by $5 million in 2016.
While our first quarter 2016 corporate cost were high reflecting continued investment primary in the IT. I'm confident we were actually over achieved that $5 million goal in 2016 excluding an unavoidable increase in legal cost.
We must succeed the goal because despite our commitment to cut cost some expenses continue to significantly exceed our expectations. For example, we've a number of legacy legal actions related to contested contracts that have raised legal expenses significantly in 2015 and will cost even more in 2016.
Cost to file these claims contributes to an increase in legal expense from approximately $6 million in 2014 to $8 million last year as none of these matters can be resolved. We anticipate legal actions in 2016 could exceed $12 million.
As a business leader I'm shocked at some of the frivolous unfounded claims levied against Ciber. We have no choice but vigorously defend our company on behalf of our customers, our employees and our shareholders.

As one example, I have told you about a sizeable project in the U.K. that we decided to end early after the contract that became terrible due to indefinite cost exposures.
This dispute with Century [Indiscernible] is still outstanding. A course a short term head to our financial results that will continue through the second quarter and it is also contributing to high legal expenses.
Exiting this contract was a painful decision to make, but I'm confident that was a correct move. Importantly, we have incurred no substantial contract litigation in 2016 since dramatically improved our processes for betting and managing our engagement.
Marketing has spent considerable effort and investment to reduce the likelihood of ongoing issues with current and respective transaction. In essence our company's goal is to sign no contract without been highly confident that we can deliver.
Regarding cash, Christian will provide a detailed discussion, but I wanted to reiterate our expectation for positive generation of cash from operations in 2016. We are also working to the best non-strategic operations.
Just this week we reach an agreement to sell our Australian operation to its management and we continue to evaluate additional divestitures. As a reminder, we have performed total shareholder return and individual total shareholder return analysis for entire business.
We have created a capital allocation strategy, we've recently engage in investment bank to help us with potential transaction and now we're ready recommendations to our Boards of Directors at our next meeting later this month.
As I continue to update even our performance throughout 2016, I believe our second half results will show increased revenues and cash which came in from a high booking, targeted investments, and focused on cost containment.
As I told before revenue growth is a key to expanding margins in this competitive market. Ciber must continue its transformation towards a broader set of offerings involving Ciber Momentum, Ciber Transformation Services, Talent Services and our industry verticals that takes advantage of the skill set of our talented employees.
As we execute on our positive bookings and strategic assets allocation we will achieve revenue growth, good margin and strong cash flow. In conclusion, management and the board are aligned on the actions necessary to achieve a multi-year turnaround of Ciber and accomplish our goals of significantly increasing shareholder value.
These actions are reigniting revenue growth in all areas of the business through re-investment and revenue producers and the launch of new and innovative product. Improving operating margins by eliminating harmful legacy incentive plan and leveraging our global operating model to deliver standardized repeatable premier offering.
Resulting long standing legal challenges while leveraging our disciplined structure processed and paid to strengthen customer communications and contract management to prevent new issues before they can begin.
Exiting non-strategic businesses and generating positive operating cash flow and improving our financial position. I will now hand the call over to Christian.
Christian Mezger
Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. I will provide a few highlights for the most recent quarter. Overall revenue of $175 million was disappointing leaving [ph] currency which negatively impacted the topline by about $5 million on a year-over-year basis.
Our first quarter revenue in North America was primarily driven by lower booking levels during the first half of last year. As previously mentioned, bookings in Talent Services were negatively impacted by multiple years on the investment prior to 2015. It takes a considerable amount of time to transfer revenues after years of neglect.

[Indiscernible] for the recent year-over-year growth in North America bookings. A 7% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an 11% increase in the first quarter of 2016. In the international segment, revenues were impacted by our exit of certain contracts particularly Sanctuary Housing in the U.K. that we discussed previously. In addition, lower 2015 bookings also clocked lower revenues.
On a positive note, year-over-year first quarter bookings improved in the international segment. It is critical that we sustained bookings growth in 2016 to achieve revenue growth and improved profitability during the second half of the year. We believe our investment and focus on generating bookings has started to pay off. Its reflected in year-over-year improvement in bookings during the first quarter.
As Michael has previously said our road to sustainable improvement in margin, profit and cash generation also depends on the additional cost reduction we have taken and will continue to affect in the near term. We have initiated headcount reductions since the end of the quarter.
Lower operating margins does not only reduce revenue but also continued investment and higher litigation [ph] expenses from contested legacy contract. Each investment program is vigorously monitored to ensure its good turn.
We had cash usage in the most recent period as it's difficult for Ciber’s first quarter and it was substantially lower than the usage during the year ago period. We are highly focussed on generating positive operating cash for the year.
We reached agreement in principle to sell our Australian operation to its management. This business has limited [Indiscernible] and has geographically isolated from the rest of Ciber and an exit will improve our focus of core operation. We had an $86 million non-cash impairment charge in the first quarter related to our international segment. The sustained decline and the Company’s stock price earlier this year led to a goodwill impairment assessment. The review [ph] concluded that the fair value of goodwill in our international segment was below its current value.
Overall, despite challenges in the first half of the year we believe we are on track to deliver a continued book-to-bill improvement, revenue growth, cost reduction and positive operating margins during the second half of 2016.
Turning to company’s financial results. Revenue in the first quarter of 2016 was $175 million, down 10% sequentially and 11% year-over-year both in constant currency. When measured in U.S. dollars, revenue was down 10% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 23.3% down from 25.6% in the prior year, primarily due to lower revenues and pricing pressure. SG&A expense in constant currency was $49 million for the quarter, up 10% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially.
SG&A increased compared to last year due to higher corporate cost and previously mentioned investment. Corporate cost grew up both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher legal expenses, transition costs associated with outsourcing Ciber's IT and cost related to our SAP implementation.
The other [ph] two items also drove the increase in sequential corporate cost. As mentioned before, we addressed the increasing cost with additional headcount reduction. Adjusted operating loss from continuing operations totaled $8.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted net loss from continuing operations in the first quarter before amortization and restructuring charges was $10 million or $0.13 per share compared to net income of $4 million or $0.05 per share in the year ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis net loss from continuing operations was $97 million or $1.21 per share including the non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Looking at our North America segment, revenue performance in the first quarter was impacted by tightening client budget that led to [Indiscernible] spending reduction and pricing pressure, which we have seen across the IT services industry.

Revenue was $100 million down 6% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Growth in our input practise and the addition of Ciber Transformation Service revenues were more than offset by year-over-year declines in the rest of the businesses.
Talent Service revenues in North America were down also the rate of decline were slow due to the investments we made in the business. We expect these investments will return this business to revenue and profits growth in the second half of 2016.
In addition, coming up at strong 2015 revenues in our Oracle practice were down year-over-year in the first quarter as we completed specific projects. While we saw fewer available and signed deals spent in 2015 and an associated increase in competition, we did record strong Oracle booking in the first quarter of 2016.
North America gross profit margin was 25.1% down from 27.5% in last years first quarter and down from 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Our gross margins were negatively impacted by decline in revenues in Oracle and ADM businesses.
Gross profits in these practices was also impacted by bill rate decline and higher bench [ph] cost resulting from contract negotiations delays and pricing pressures. On the other hand, our input business saw improved gross profit margins due to across the market revenue growth.
SG&A expense was $18.4 million down 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Year-over-year declines were driven by previous cost reductions partially offset by the necessary investment Ciber Momentum, Ciber Transformation Services and Talent Services.
Operating margins of 6.6% was down 290 basis points compared to the year ago period and down 330 basis points sequentially. The decline was driven by lower gross margins resulting from revenue decline. Our strong bookings in the first quarter and our expectations that book-to-bill trends will continue to be strong, give us confidence that we will achieve revenue and profitability growth in the second half of 2016.
I will now discuss the international sector. First quarter revenues were $76 million down 16% in constant currency compared to a year ago quarter due to declines across most of our operations. In U.S. dollars the year-over-year decline was 21%. As in previous quarters the U.K. were half of the year-over-year revenue decline. The shortfall was partially offset by healthy growth in our German Managed Services.
Sequential revenues in our international segment were down 12% on a constant currency basis and 13% on a U.S. dollar basis. Sequentially revenues were impacted by seasonality and a decline in the number of billable consultants.
Gross profit margin was 20.6% in the first quarter down 270 basis points year-over-year and down 250 basis points sequentially. Gross margin declines are directly related to lower revenue and the limited flexibility to make timely adjustments to our labor cost base.
SG&A was $16.6 million during the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year due to investment to Ciber Momentum. We had an operating loss from continuing operations of $1 million. To restore international operations to acceptable levels of profitability, we must continue to grow bookings to increase revenue and gross profit. My last year’s restructuring addressed the realignment to the global operating model. We are accelerating other aggressive actions to meet our overhead structure to lower our revenues.
Also, our delivery mix of billable hours delivered EMEA and offshore continues to improve. As a company, we exceeded 25% of billable hours delivered offshore in the first quarter. I will now discuss cash and our balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $80 million compared to $20 million at year end 2015. Cash used in operating activities and continued operations was $3 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared with cash usage of $34 million in the first quarter of 2015.

Changes in working capital primarily contributed to the overall improvement. This included a $9 million sequential decrease in our accounts receivable provision compared to relatively flat receivables in 2015 and a more modest reduction in accrued [ph] competition.
Total DSO was 71 days at the end of the first quarter compared to the 63 days and the year ago period and 64 days at the end of the fourth quarter. This temporary increase was mainly driven by rapidly declining revenues in the quarter. At the same time, we have seen an improvement in the ageing of our receivables both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.
Our cash usage in the first quarter included investments of $2 million. The outstanding balance on the credit facility is $40 million at the end of March 31, 2016 compared to $33 million at year end.
Capital expenditures were $5 million in the quarter. We had now a run rate for core capital expenditures to about $2 million per quarter. The increments of CapEx in the first quarter is related to the implementation of the new ERP and HRM systems and to a lesser extent spending for Ciber Momentum.
In summary, while it was a difficult quarter we are encouraged by the increase in bookings that are expected to improve our value performance during the second half of 2016. We are taken decisive actions to lower our G&A cost structure to improve profitability and cash flow during the second half of this year. We expect to over achieve to $5 million goal to lower G&A in 2016 excluding the potential impact of higher legal cost.
Lastly, with our evaluations completed, we are now ready to make recommendations on the divestiture of non strategic businesses at the next meeting of our board of directors in mid-May.
With that, I would like to open it up for Q&A. Operator, please give the instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Marco Rodriguez with Stonegate Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Marco Rodriguez
Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Real quick, I want to kind of ask a question in regarding – clarification on the SG&A, you just mentioned that you're going to exceed the $5 million in cost reductions, but you said that you're excluding the increase in legal costs. So, can you kind of give us either the numbers or the expectations as far as what the numbers will be either separated or combined, I mean, you add a $49 million run rate right now, I'm just trying to figure out how that's going to flow?
Christian Mezger
Yes. Marco, good morning. This is Christian. So first of all, thanks for the question. The legal expenses are and Michael outlined some parameters around in his script. It's really hard to estimate depending on how those cases built. Obviously we will exceed on the G&A side of reductions and I mentioned in my script that we initiated additional headcount actions in the G&A space.
So, it is really very hard for us to say, to how much litigation cost do incur as these cases move through. So, for your model I would model that G&A reductions will be outline and I would take a few of some increment to million dollars [ph] in terms of litigation expense throughout the rest of the year.
Marco Rodriguez
And is that also factoring the additional investments that you're making as well?
Christian Mezger
Yes, it is.
Marco Rodriguez
Okay. And then, in terms of just a quick housekeeping item, on the FX rates what did you see in the quarter the average rates for the euro and the pound?
Christian Mezger
Yes. I think if you look at this current quarter on an average I believe the euro was somewhere in the 1/10, 1/11 range. I think if were call the euro today, I think it's about 1/15, 1/14.
Marco Rodriguez

Okay. And then in terms of the bookings color that you've provided is helpful, but just wondering if there is an absolute – if there's an actual dollar value that you can kind of provide as far as some additional color? And then also in regard to that just trying to kind of think through your guidance as far as the negative impact that bookings had in the first half of 2015, and how that impacted Q1. It kind of sounds like Q2 should also being negatively impacted on a year-over-year comparison basis, but obviously its sound like your guidance that second half should see some top line growth. Is that fair?
Christian Mezger
Yes. Let me take your questions in the pieces you ask them, right. First, we said that second quarter will be challenging, right. So, some of that miss in bookings will show itself in second quarter. However, second half we expect revenue growth based on the bookings profile that we see today.
In terms of providing an absolute dollar number in terms booking, I think we have the book-to-bill ratio that we outline that should be greater than 1:1.
Marco Rodriguez
Got you. How does that book-to-bill compare sequentially in year-over-year?
Christian Mezger
On a year-over-year basis as we said, this is an improvement, on a sequentially it’s a slight improvement.
Marco Rodriguez
So, were they below one in the prior periods?
Christian Mezger
In the prior year comparison you compared to a less than one.
Marco Rodriguez
Okay. And then, another quick question here, just in terms of how we should be thinking about the new services that you're offering, obviously you gave some numbers on the proof-of-concept from Momentum, just any sort of additional color in terms of potential revenue impacts that you might be seeing, expectations as far as time is concerned, any sort of the new services would be helpful?
Michael Boustridge
So, let me, Marco, let me give some color on Momentum. The paid proof-of-concept in Europe is important because it's actually a paid proof-of-concept where some of the previous ones that we done, the margin that we've completed, some of those were not paid for, in another words, they were costs, so that's an important point.
On the first pilot that we did, we have sustained the additional $1.7 million in terms of the modernization project, and our pipeline and we think we will go for this quarter we expect additional announcements around sales of Momentum. And the delivery of the product which is probably as important is going very well. And the time to take to deliver, the output of the Ciber Momentum pilot to the customer that inflows through for us to revenue is occurring within the time frame and within the cost cycle and the envelope that we thought we would do. So the margin profile that we believe this product will produce – to be producing good margin profile.
The outlook in terms of what we did and we're going from a white label or a partnering position on Momentum continues to make accelerated progress and I believe we'll be in a good position to talk about that in the next coming months. And I believe the overall reaction to Ciber Momentum continues to be very strong with our existing customers and our large customers and also make new customers, which the pilot in Germany is actually a net new bank that we wouldn't have without Momentum.
Marco Rodriguez
Okay, great, guys. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your questions.
Brian Kinstlinger
Great. Thanks so much guys. Sequential reduction in International 12%, can you quantify the factors for example, how much was pricing, how much was turnover employees that you can generate revenue, maybe customer consolidation, anything that factored into and give us roughly how much of it was that 12%?

Christian Mezger
Brian, this is Christian, good morning. So, if you look at the factors on a sequential basis, I would say about roughly half of the reductions relate to lower amount of bill what we sources [ph]. Then there is some seasonality as you know depending on when Easter falls. So that on a sequential basis it actually had few less vulnerable days depending which country you're in.
I'm not aware of any significant client loss in the quarter, so I would say it’s – what I've referred to as well, what we probably saw more in the U.S. around the IT service industry, right and the market trends we see there, that's important to consider. I think out of the gate in the first quarter company's tightened their budget or prolonged their budget cycles. So you would not be in a position to close deals as fast as you were potentially planning.
Michael Boustridge
And Brian, Michael here. We've had – we have had as we had last Q1, 2015 as we have Q1, Q2 of this year. The necessary work that we're doing and it's very painful around realigning compensation structures does results in reliable [ph] consultant deciding that they wish to move out of Ciber. We had situation last year was in 2014 around the Netherlands we've had in 2015, was in 2016, those changes we're making to that compensation system. We do get higher than expected employee turnaround which does negatively impact us, but these changes absolutely necessary to be done.
Brian Kinstlinger
And when do you do billable resources to gain that back, I mean, did that just loss revenue in your just lower base cause it’s hard to hear that when you go back so quickly or maybe take us through how that changed over the course of the year?
Christian Mezger
Yes. I think you're right, you lose that revenue stream initially and I think we're including assets to create new talent to the company and rebuild that revenue stream. In our discussion on the one hand side improve bookings, right, so that allows me to go out and hire people against that one business, at the same time to bring talent into the company that can allows me to sell that back into the market with specific superior skills.
Brian Kinstlinger
Okay. And then in North America, you comment there's a weak talent services bookings and unknown investment there. And I would expected you have a large tailwind with your large Talent Services contract maybe take us through is that ramp is expected, maybe how much revenue is generating and just surprising to hear those comments and factor for the business being hurt [ph]?
Michael Boustridge
I'll let Christian get [Indiscernible] on the facts. But I think the numbers we gave Brian, as well as the discussion we gave was, in this Talent Services business, when we've had three or four years of taking costs out which means you take the recruiters out in terms of how you're going to take people out of the organization. Ciber took the decision to take our recruiting time out which of course lowered the ability to grow when you need recruiters to grow the Talent Services, decision make, they executed it.
We started as mentioned last year to say that was actually not such -- was good thing to do. I thought that our Talent Services engineer side was incredibly power. We have an incredible relationship with our customers. And so I reinvested dollars in second quarter and third quarter last year to start to put back recruiters that have been taken out of the last three, four years back into the company.
The time it takes although recruiting to back to positive growth takes about two or three quarters because by the time the recruiters get on board we start to pull racks [ph], we start to get the positions, it then flows through, what we saw is, we're starting to see that positive trend now back up.

Customer talked about what we have in the script. You are also referring to our transformation services contract I think, which is actually in a very good spot. We have very high customer satisfaction and if you remember at the time, I said it's a very large contract. I wanted to make sure that we knew how to do this. It’s a brand new offering. I wanted to make sure we could take it on board that we would be in position where we had a negative impact to Ciber which we have not had.
We'll continue to see good delivery and growth. And then, what I also said was margin profile of those deals typically came to be very -- they tend to have a more hockey stick effect which means that the latter end of the second half of the contract is where you see the greater profit of the deal. And this is a three-year transaction, so we are now on come out to our nearly our first anniversary.
Brian Kinstlinger
Is that contract generates significant revenues in quarterly basis right now? I mean, can you give the numbers?
Christian Mezger
Yes. I think it's still in the low single digits from the total company perspective in terms of revenue contribution, right. At the same time as Michael just mentioned its start to grow in terms of resources that we add to this contract. And I think just one very important piece is, it gives us the experience that we gain in this contract, so that we can now go and have a broad of product launch, have more conservations with our other clients.
Michael Boustridge
But I think its important question to be to say it Brian, we are not raising money on this contract. This contract is accretive and although not at the level of expanded Talent Services deals, but it is revenue and margin accretive.
Christian Mezger
Yes. And let me touch on Talent Services for a minute. Michael mentioned the hiring of the comp partners and recruiters. We continue to invest into that business in Q1. And what you see is that revenue decline that we experienced particularly in first half of last year continues to slowdown and that in the second half year of this year we expect that business to grow particularly as we did invest in Q1.
Brian Kinstlinger
Okay.
Michael Boustridge
And I think, the only other color Brian I would add is, on the actual top end we did compression in the first quarter where some of our largest Talent Services contracts that came out for negotiations and we did keep all of those contracts will be at – we are into that renegotiation.
Brian Kinstlinger
Can we touch on Momentum quickly?
Michael Boustridge
Yes.
Brian Kinstlinger
Can you provide some updated and reasonable revenue targets in 2016 and 2017, just more clear on the return on investment and how long its going to take?
Kris Douglas
Yes. Overall you look at Momentum revenues for this year we're going to be mid single million digits in terms of revenues, right. And as we outlined it takes 12 months to get to a tailwind, right. As we had some single clients that has look at an accelerated time line, but I think still that overall that 12 plus months data cycle holds.
I think in terms return to the program overall, we outline the investment for this year and previous calls with $5 million, so we have a very quick – a very reasonable return and payback on this investment. And as you go in scale in the coming years I think it is a good investment and as I said in my script, we look at every program across the company ensure that we have the right return and Momentum is no different.
Michael Boustridge
Yes. I think Kris just add a little color to that. I think Brian the fact that the return will be in terms of the investment outlaid and the revenue that we plan to get this year makes a very quick return on net investment, the initial investment I mentioned point number one as Christian mentioned.

I think more importantly as we've outlined the investment in the script, and as Momentum takes off than we'll come and talk about an acceleration of that investment, as we do see slowing down of Momentum and we do group as the value is not there, which I don't believe is the case, then we would clearly cut the investment in the second half of the year and tie this more around where we've seen the growth.
But I'm feeling confident that what I'm seeing what customers are telling me and what we've seen in terms of additional wins that we've not announced yet. I think I'm feeling confident that Momentum is the good investment and the payback is very quick for what we have done.
Brian Kinstlinger
If we look at next year, Michael, what would disappoint you and what is reasonable for example, would $20 million in Momentum revenue disappoint you? Would that suggest you that making progress and you grow after, I mean, just give us a sense for what success is for you?
Michael Boustridge
No. I think that's a good question, Brian and I think what we just – the number you mentioned that was quite progress to be honest, I mean, that would be fairly good growth. When I first launched Momentum, you know I said this could be and I said, it could $100 million plus business in three years, so you launch the product, it takes 12 months to get revenue and then you got three years to run up to business.
Now, I think what Momentum has to have is multi-prong strategy. We have to sign partners that will go and sell Momentum as part of their offering in modernization methods to the client. We have to continue to sell and into our existing base and into our new base, we have to extend our ecosystem of partners that sell on behalf of technology specs like CIA and like [Indiscernible] Security and if all of those three things happened which is a plan than I do believe we will see that type of growth in 2016 and with margin associated with that growth which is probably the next question which is an important, I think we said, we believe this is a way we are putting 40%, 50% margin, I think that is what we're actually seeing in the results of what we've done to-date.
Brian Kinstlinger
Okay. Last question I have, can you give us a sense for how much revenue Australia had in 2015 as well as the first quarter and then what's the operating loss, I mean, I think there is one there?
Michael Boustridge
Yes on a revenue basis you look at something that is upper single digit millions of dollars on revenue contribution [Indiscernible] year-over-year. And when you look at our contribution of margin if you fully load this, this was not accretive to the overall company performance. And the question again.
Brian Kinstlinger
Did you recognize revenue in 1Q or was it discontinued?
Michael Boustridge
The revenues included in 1Q results.
Brian Kinstlinger
So in Q2 will you see that drop of about -- $6 million to $8 million presumably?
Christian Mezger
I quoted you a…
Brian Kinstlinger
I’m sorry. A few million, sorry you’re right.
Christian Mezger
Yes, so as I said in my remarks the principle [Indiscernible] agreement we need to bring this to close, okay and we are working on that.
Brian Kinstlinger
I think once it comes out.
Christian Mezger
Yes, you are right. It will have a couple of million.
Michael Boustridge
I think Brian, its more of I believe to [Indiscernible] in Q3 and Q4 and I’ve had a lot of feedback from our institutional shareholders around progress in the call [Indiscernible] and in Q3 and Q4 I talked about the review of our strategic and non-strategic component. It goes back to the total shareholder return and the IP is up. At the time last time I said that we had significant work to get done to get those assets in the slice [ph] per week of fuel, good about them and as you said in the scripts remarks this quarter we’ll go to the board in the next coming meeting and present what we believe the outcome of that results. And Australia there is a part of that analysis. We have gone through considerable lengths to make sure what we do is actually very good to Ciber and is at the end of the day accretive.

Brian Kinstlinger
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with B. Riley & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. A little bit of maybe a different angle. When looking at that revenue weakness, could you attribute two things. One, any verticals that were particularly weak, number one. And number two, how much of the weakness would you attribute to macro general softness relative to internal under investment of the company?
Michael Boustridge
Won [ph] let’s see if I can -- I’ll start and then I’ll hand it to Christian. In our verticals, I believe we saw weakness in our Oracle practise. And that was probably due to the following factors. You know we had two or three years of really good growth in the Oracle practice. They then left a substantial amount of contracts to be delivered and we focused on delivering and therefore the sell of net new didn’t appear and that cause by issuing.
I think the industry movement between on trend [ph] and cloud have accelerated and we took a bit of time to demonstrate that in each of our ISE practices we could actually sell and successfully deliver a cloud implementation and we’ve done that all for Oracle Info, Microsoft and SAP. From a Medco [ph] I will tell you that there is an increase feeding frenzy for contracts.
And when you see customers go out with this, what we have seen is an increased number of companies giving into the space to try and compete in that businesses. So it may be two years ago when say an Info or an Oracle or an SAP contract came up for bidding, you would see four or five people. Now you are seeing you know 12, 14 people at the initial berth. We are still making it through because Ciber’s credentials are still incredibly strong but there is a lot of competition now and as we move to cloud getting those cloud credentials, they are very important because we are probably the only film now that has cloud credentials and all of that verticals that we compete again.
Christian Mezger
Yes, I think as I said earlier, in our top clients, if I look at our top clients and I look at Talent services kind of engagement, right, you can see that probably about a third to a half of that top set of top clients had [indiscernible] processes that normally complete in the fourth quarter and you know right out of the gate, what is the volume that's to be contracted. And it seems many of these contracts being either delayed to put in place or they're going to go and just have the pricing negotiations that Michael mentioned.
Michael Boustridge
So an example of that, Won [ph], would be the fourth quarter where we had probably three to four of our largest contracts being realized, they were unplanned simply due to some of their own financial returns that they needed to get done. They followed the three to four weeks in the fourth quarter, which took a significant time to ramp that back up to full mode in the first quarter. We've never seen that quite before. Typically, we notified so that we have time that needs a very quick action.
So I think it was just an abnormality between two or three customers that caused that, but that wasn't a gaming factor. In terms of pricing pressure, we're a competitive market but Ciber does in his Talent Services have a very good reputation and we're providing fairly good high resources and I find that the talent that we provide is keeping us in the customer set and we haven't lost any really large contracts in that Talent Services business since I've been here.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, perfect. Regarding the staffing business, profitability is that still -- is it positive and can you comment North America and international as well please?

Christian Mezger
Yes, and I think that's a great question. And we said before, when we decided to invest in this business, not only because of the linkage to our rest of the portfolio but it gave a good margin business for Ciber. It has a good profit pool and we believe in the strength of that business.
Michael Boustridge
Yeah, I think when you look at the customer and you look at what Ciber has been through the last two years, narrowing down our share of portfolio services and offerings. We take to the market, having access into a customer who is incredibly important. So talent transformation services is good accretive margin that allows us the access to go sell our additional products and services into that account.
What we did when decisions were made previously to cut that business, it has a very negative impact, very quickly because you have and then I say with the clients and that allows you to compete, to put bodies into their talents into that customer. When you cut the number of recruiters, you cut the number of people that can actually respond to that. You basically cut that channel off and to run that channel back up needs you to go back re-establish those MSAs, you got to re-establish relationships, you got to then get back into the system stack, then go to compete, it just takes some time to get it done. And as Christian mentioned, the investments we did in Q2, Q3 and Q1, I believe will have a very positive impact to the second half of this year.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, guys, thank you very much. And then…
Michael Boustridge
Eddie [ph], and I think one other comment want is -- I think the other comment would be our first momentum that I talked about in the U.S. came from an account with the account partner grew through the relationship we had sold that momentum into that customer and that is why the investment in Talent Services have a very good one-to-one payback when you tie it to the products and services like momentum that were still into the account.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, perfect. Could you -- you provided caller on what you expect for second quarter and second half in terms of revenues. Can you address gross margins, should that follow, what we should we be expecting on revenues as well?
Christian Mezger
Yeah, I think one of the reasons why we saw margin compression here in the first quarter was that it depressed revenue. Once you add revenue to the picture in the second half, we expect gross profit and ultimately cash flow to improve.
Michael Boustridge
I also think Christian to give color to everyone, we spend a considerable amount of time and investment making sure that the business we sell has a good margin profile for the company. You know last year we spent a lot of time getting rid of what we called bad revenue, which was revenue that came with 100% sub contracting delivery and that we had no real oversight as to the quality of delivery that was done.
I think that investment we did was well worth it and therefore we have to make sure that what we sell and positive bookings is incredibly important and which is why I've given the -- given you all that as indicator, because bookings greater than one to one engine [ph] not eating your backlog. When you have the bookings ratio below 1, it's dilutive. In other words, you're eating all your backlog and eventually your backlog and that's what happens when the revenue declined. When you sell new bookings, those bookings have to have a revenue profile and a delivery profile that enables sustainable revenue accretion.
And I think we spend a lot of time making sure that that occurs in what we do and the fact that we have a much more disciplined risk profile now here at Ciber that when we sell net new and yes, it's taken us a year to get to a point where we can get bookings growth. That discipline I think is going to pay off in margin expansion long term.

Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator
There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Christian Mezger for any final remarks.
Christian Mezger
So, I appreciate your interest in Ciber. And thank you very much for joining this call this morning. And obviously, if you have any questions, please reach to us. Thank you so much.

Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Heather Pollard. Please go ahead.Heather PollardThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. My name is Heather Pollard, Director of Finance at Ciber. Welcome to Ciber's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Michael Boustridge, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Christian Mezger, our CFO.Before turning the call over to Michael, I will remind you that some of our prepared comments and responses to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the risk factors section of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K as well as other SEC filings.Also during this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. We have included reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures in our news release and on the Investor Relations section of our website, ciber.com. Today's discussion will be on a continuing operations basis. Please refer to our SEC filings on Form 10-Q and 8-K for a recap of historical comparisons.With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ciber's President and CEO, Michael Boustridge. Michael?Michael BoustridgeThank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call. Ciber's transformation continues. Our third quarter results very clearly reflect both the costs and the benefit of our plans to be a leader in staffing, services and software as a service delivery. We continue to execute against the strategy, making the balance investments listed to accelerate our long-term company's growth. We are concentrating our efforts on a specific range of service offerings, process improvements and talent enhancements that I initiated when I joined Ciber last year. Specifically, we have focused on five tightly defined pillars. We announced our new SaaS offering [indiscernible] which includes the ability to grow rapidly, increase profits and transform our customer's business.This offering has the potential to double the margins of our existing business and create deeper, more valuable and long lasting current relationships. We used our Ciber transformation services offering with an iconic win at HP. Combined the last two points, we linked Ciber Momentum and Ciber transformation services together to enhance the benefits to both offerings. We added a number of leaders in Ciber executives with specific skillset and knowledge needed to support Ciber Momentum and Ciber transformation services. While these additional resources may raise our SG&A costs, Ciber Momentum and Ciber transformation services require a specific go-to market approach.And lastly we continue to build resource in India. We added 70 actual wells this quarter and made trading number billable hours delivered offshore to 25%. As Ciber Momentum penetrates the market, we expect to dramatically increase our offshore talent. While our mid-term results reflect the cost of these investments, we remain committed to achieving 6% to 8% operating margins with investments by the second half of 2016. Our recent progress in Ciber Momentum and Ciber transformation services reinforces my confidence in the achievability of these results. I cannot stress enough that this level of profitability will not materialize without significant investments. Christian will provide details on our spending in his remarks, but I would like to update the metric I began last quarter.In my last quarter remarks, I noted that we have invested $5 million over the 12 months in new market and offering development. We accelerated our pace of investment last quarter, spending $2 million, bringing the total to $7 million. We continue to expect the high level investments over the near-term as our spending patterns evolve beyond product development to include marketing expenditures, customer proof of concept and ultimately startup cost for wins associated for both Ciber Momentum and Ciber transformation services.As you know, our service offerings are focused amongst five pillars. Our newest pillar, software as a service delivery delivered the Ciber compliance suite on a SaaS model and launched Ciber Momentum beginning with North America this past quarter. Ciber Momentum is our automated platform for application normalization which we believe will free customers from the unsustainable cost and operating models associated with legacy applications. Every survey we have seen indicates application normalizations as a top priority for CIO. Ciber Momentum enable CIOs to attain the business processes that define the company while delivering the next generation application that takes advantages of the cost and benefits of cloud delivering models and an ability to show commodity technologies and readily available talent pools.Our goal is to be among the market leaders in application modernization. We know that we are not the only competitor in this field and we are not currently the largest. We are the only company however with a market differentiated technology which gives us Ciber Momentum product at least over the competition.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com
