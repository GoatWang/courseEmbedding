The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

About Risks: An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. A Fund’s ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The funds may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review a Fund prospectus for a complete description.

	Investment Summary








	Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio, Series 1







	Investment Objective.




	The Portfolio seeks total return through a
	combination of capital appreciation and dividend income by investing in a selection of dividend-paying international common stocks.






	Selection Criteria.




	In seeking to achieve the Portfolios objective, Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., the Sponsor, sought the recommendations of an
	equity investment team of its affiliate, Eaton Vance Management (the equity team). The equity team used a selection strategy that began by analyzing stocks ranked in the second quintile of the MSCI World ex-U.S. Index

	1

	(the Index) based on dividend yield as of the close of business on                 , 2016. All of the
	stocks in the Index, and therefore the Portfolio, are of international companies listed on exchanges outside the U.S., each tied economically to the country in which their stock is listed. The foundation of the selection strategy is based on an
	investment theory that the second quintile of dividend-paying equity securities in the Index generally represents a selection of companies with sound financial management, strong business franchises, and attractive valuations, and may provide more
	sustainable dividends than those companies in the first quintile. From this initial universe of stocks, the equity team focused on companies with a stock price of at least $5 per share and a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion. In
	finalizing their recommendations, the equity team considered each companys history of paying and/or increasing dividends over the last ten years, as well as the average daily trading volume of its stock. Based upon the equity teams
	recommendations, the Sponsor selected a final portfolio of 30 dividend-paying common stocks for inclusion in the Portfolio on an equally weighted basis.



	While the Portfolio has a term of approximately 24 months, it is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of
	the portfolio when the current Portfolio terminates, and you may be able to reinvest your proceeds into a subsequent series at a reduced sales charge. Repeatedly rolling over an investment in a unit investment trust will differ from long-term
	investments in other investment products when considering the sales charges, fees, expenses and tax consequences attributable to a Unitholder. For more information see Selling Units  Rollover.





	Principal Risks.




	As with all investments, you can lose money by
	investing in this Portfolio. The Portfolio is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for
	reasons such as these:



	 




	 


	


	 





	Security prices will fluctuate.



	The value of your investment may fall over time.




	 




	 


	


	 





	An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared.



	This may result in a reduction in the value of your
	Units.




	 




	 


	


	 







	The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.





	This may occur at any point
	in time, including during the initial offering period.




	 




	 


	


	 





	The Portfolio invests exclusively in stocks of foreign issuers



	. Investments in foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the U.S., including expropriation,
	armed conflict, confiscatory taxation, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards, less publicly available financial and other information, and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations.




	 




	 


	


	 





	The Portfolio invests in stocks of smaller capitalization companies.



	These stocks are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than stocks of larger companies.
	Smaller capitalization companies may have limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.




	 




	 


	


	 





	We do not actively manage the Portfolio.



	Except in limited circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and may continue to buy, shares of the same securities even if their market
	value declines.

	The MSCI World ex USA Index captures large and mid-cap representation across 22 of 23 developed market countries, excluding the United States. With approximately 1,020 constituents, the index covers approximately 85% of
	the free float-adjusted market in each of the 22 represented countries.

	Example




	This
	Example is intended to help you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit trusts and mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio and that you reinvest your proceeds in a new trust every other year at a reduced
	sales charge of $0.295 per Unit (for Standard Accounts) or with the creation and development fee of $0.05 per Unit and no transactional sales charge (for Fee Based Accounts). The Example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year and that
	the Portfolios, and each new trusts, operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

	$


	    


	  


	    


	$


	        


	  





	 


	The maximum sales
	charge is 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit. The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge (maximum of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales charge and the
	total creation and development fee. The deferred sales charge is fixed at $0.245 per Unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on                 , 2016.
	The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the transactional sales charge. The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period
	(anticipated to be approximately three months) or six months following the Initial Date of Deposit.


	 




	*


	The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the Initial Date of Deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the Portfolio does
	not reach the estimated size, or if the value of the Portfolio or number of outstanding units decline over the life of the trust, or if the actual amount of the operating expenses exceeds the estimated amounts, the actual amount of the operating
	expenses per 100 units would exceed the estimated amounts. In some cases, the actual amount of operating expenses may substantially differ from the amounts reflected above.

	Investment Summary








	Eaton Vance Sustainable Impact Portfolio, Series 1







	Investment Objective.




	The Portfolio seeks total return by investing
	in a selection of equity securities of companies considered to have demonstrated a commitment to their sustainability and impact practices.






	Selection Criteria.




	In seeking to achieve the Portfolios objective, Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., the Sponsor, sought the recommendations of an
	equity investment team of its affiliate, Eaton Vance Management (the equity team). Beginning with an initial universe of all U.S.-listed common stocks, the equity team then focused on companies with a stock price of at least $5 per
	share, a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion, and an average trading volume over the prior 30 days of at least $2 million per day. From the resulting group of stocks, the equity team focused on identifying companies it considers to have
	demonstrated a commitment to their sustainability and impact practices based on analysis of a broad range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, also taking into consideration key ESG issues that may be particularly relevant to a
	companys industry. Sustainability and impact practices refer to a companys approach to various ESG factors, with the intent of generating a positive social or environmental impact. In completing its sustainability and impact analysis,
	the equity team considered ESG factors such as a companys governance practices, product quality and safety, workplace diversity practices, environmental impact and sustainability, community investment and development, and human rights record.
	The equity team further analyzed the potential ESG impacts and risks of a company, considered how well the company manages these impacts and risks, and ascertained the companys willingness and ability to take a leadership position in
	implementing best practices. Based upon the equity teams recommendations, the Sponsor selected a final portfolio of 30 stocks for inclusion in the Portfolio on an equally weighted basis.



	While the Portfolio has a term of approximately 24 months, it is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the
	portfolio when the current Portfolio terminates, and you may be able to reinvest your proceeds into a subsequent series at a reduced sales charge. Repeatedly rolling over an investment in a unit investment trust will differ from long-term
	investments in other investment products when considering the sales charges, fees, expenses and tax consequences attributable to a Unitholder. For more information see Selling Units  Rollover.





	Principal Risks.




	As with all investments, you can lose money by
	investing in this Portfolio. The Portfolio is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for
	reasons such as these:



	 




	 


	


	 





	Security prices will fluctuate.



	The value of your investment may fall over time.




	 




	 


	


	 





	An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared.



	This may result in a reduction in the value of your
	Units.




	 




	 


	


	 





	The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.



	This may occur at any point in time,
	including during the initial offering period.




	 




	 


	


	 





	The Portfolios emphasis on sustainability and impact investing may not necessarily result in favorable investment performance.



	The selection of the Portfolios
	investments is based significantly upon an assessment of ESG factors, which will affect the Portfolios exposure to certain industries or sectors. As a result, the Portfolios relative performance may depend on whether the industries and
	sectors in which it is exposed are in or out of favor in the market.




	 




	 


	


	 





	We do not actively manage the Portfolio.



	Except in limited circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and may continue to buy, shares of the same securities even if their market
	value declines.

	sales charge of $0.295 per Unit (for Standard Accounts) or with the creation and development fee of $0.05 per Unit and no transactional sales charge (for Fee Based Accounts). The Example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year and that
	the Portfolios, and each new trusts, operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

	The maximum sales
	charge is 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit. The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge (maximum of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales charge and the
	total creation and development fee. The deferred sales charge is fixed at $0.245 per Unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on             , 2016. The combination of the
	initial and deferred sales charges comprises the transactional sales charge. The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
	approximately three months) or six months following the Initial Date of Deposit.


	 




	*


	The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the Initial Date of Deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the Portfolio does
	not reach the estimated size, or if the value of the Portfolio or number of outstanding units decline over the life of the trust, or if the actual amount of the operating expenses exceeds the estimated amounts, the actual amount of the operating
	expenses per 100 units would exceed the estimated amounts. In some cases, the actual amount of operating expenses may substantially differ from the amounts reflected above.

	Prospectus dated                 , 2016











	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm






	To the Sponsor, Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., and Unit Holders of Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3




	We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition, including the portfolios of investments, of Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3, comprising Eaton
	Vance International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio, Series 1, and Eaton Vance Sustainable Impact Portfolio, Series 1 (each a Trust, collectively the Trusts), as of the opening of business on
	            , 2016 (Initial Date of Deposit). These statements of financial condition are the responsibility of the Trusts Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
	these statements of financial condition based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements of financial condition are free of material misstatement. The Trusts are not required to have, nor were we
	engaged to perform, an audit of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
	supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements of financial condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trusts Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statements of
	financial condition. Our procedures included confirmation of contracts to purchase securities, by correspondence with brokers, as shown in the statements of financial condition as of the opening of business on
	            , 2016. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our
	opinion, the statements of financial condition referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3, comprising Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio, Series
	1, and Eaton Vance Sustainable Impact Portfolio, Series 1, as of the opening of business on             , 2016 (Initial Date of Deposit), in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America.

	Notes to Statements of Financial Condition




	 





	(1)

	 


	The value of the securities is determined by the Evaluator, Eaton Vance Management, on the bases set forth under Purchasing Units  Unit Price. Cash has been deposited with the Trustee for the amount
	necessary to cover the contracts to purchase securities.







	(2)

	 


	A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a Portfolio. The amount of these costs is set forth under Fees and
	Expenses. A distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial offering period (approximately three months) or six months following the Initial Date of Deposit to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the
	organization expense obligation of the investors will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of a Portfolio are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the Public Offering Price will be
	reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Portfolio.







	(3)

	 


	Represents the amount of mandatory distributions from a Portfolio on the bases set forth under Purchasing Units.







	(4)

	 


	The creation and development fee is payable by a Portfolio on behalf of Unitholders out of the assets of the Portfolio as of the close of the initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the
	initial public offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the proceeds.







	(5)

	 


	The aggregate public offering price and the aggregate sales charge are computed on the bases set forth under Purchasing Units.

	Prospectus dated                 , 2016











	The Trust




	The Portfolios were created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement), dated the date
	of this prospectus (the Initial Date of Deposit), among Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., as Sponsor, Eaton Vance Management, as Supervisor and Evaluator, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee.


	On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and cash or an irrevocable letter of
	credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In exchange, the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of Units of the Portfolios. Unless otherwise terminated as provided in the Trust Agreement,
	a Portfolio will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term Securities means the securities
	(including contracts to purchase these securities) listed in each Portfolio and any additional securities deposited into a Portfolio as a result of a corporate action or similar event.


	Additional Units of a Portfolio may be issued at any time by depositing in the Portfolio (i) additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities
	together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional Units are issued by a Portfolio, the aggregate value of the
	Securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit may be decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into a Portfolio following the Initial Date of Deposit provided that the additional
	deposits will be in amounts that will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the Portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit. Investors may
	experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because a Portfolio will pay the
	associated brokerage or acquisition fees. In the context of a unit investment trust such as your Portfolio, the term dilution refers to any reduction in the ownership percentage of such Portfolios assets resulting from the creation of
	additional units. Due to round lot requirements in certain foreign securities markets and market value fluctuations, the Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio may not be able to invest in each Security on any subsequent date of
	deposit in the same proportion as existed on the Initial Date of Deposit or immediately prior to the subsequent deposit of Securities. This could increase the potential for dilution of investments and variances in anticipated income. In addition,
	during the initial offering of Units it may not be possible to buy a particular Security due to regulatory or trading restrictions, or corporate actions. While such limitations are in effect, additional Units would be created by purchasing each of
	the Securities in your Portfolio that are not subject to those limitations. This would also result in the dilution of the investment in any such Security not purchased and potential variances in anticipated income. Purchases and sales of Securities
	by your Portfolio may impact the value of the Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of Units, upon Portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit redemptions.


	Each Unit of your Portfolio initially offered represents an undivided interest in the Portfolio. At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Initial Date of
	Deposit, the number of Units may be adjusted so that the Public Offering Price per Unit equals $10. The number of Units, fractional interest of each Unit in your Portfolio and the estimated distributions per Unit will increase or decrease to the
	extent of any adjustment. To the extent that any Units are redeemed to the Trustee or additional Units are issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in your Portfolio represented by
	each unredeemed Unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in your Portfolio will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor,
	or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


	Each Portfolio consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the purchase thereof) listed under the
	applicable Portfolio as may continue to be held from time to time in the Portfolio, (b) any additional Securities acquired and held by the Portfolio pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any cash held in the
	related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any contract failure in any of the Securities.






	Objectives and Securities Selection




	The objective of each Portfolio is described in the individual
	Portfolio sections. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its objective.


	The Sponsor does not manage the Portfolios. You should note that the Sponsor
	applied the selection criteria to the Securities for inclusion in the Portfolios prior to the Initial Date of Deposit. After the initial selection date, the Securities may no longer meet the selection criteria. Further, your Portfolio may purchase
	Securities no longer meeting the selection criteria when


	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	12


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	creating additional Portfolio units. Should a Security no longer meet the selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security from its Portfolio. In offering the Units to the public,
	neither the Sponsor nor any broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather the entire pool of Securities in the Portfolios, taken as a whole, which are represented by the Units.






	Investment Risks




	All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your Portfolio. You should understand these risks
	before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value of your Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Portfolio will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.





	Market Risk






	.




	Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your Portfolio will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to various
	factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, political, social or economic instability, the financial condition of an issuer or sector, and perceptions of an issuer or sector. Stocks are especially susceptible to general stock
	market movements. The value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably in response to market, issuer- or sector-specific events. Even though your Portfolio is supervised, you should remember that we do not manage your Portfolio. Your
	Portfolio will not sell a security solely because the market value falls, as is possible in a managed fund.






	Dividend Payment Risk






	.




	Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay dividends on a security. Stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers. Common
	stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an
	issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. If dividends received by a Portfolio are insufficient to cover expenses, redemptions or other Portfolio costs, it may be necessary for the Portfolio to sell
	Securities to cover such expenses, redemptions or other costs. Any such sales may result in capital gains or losses to you. See Tax Information.






	Foreign Stocks.




	The International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio
	invests exclusively in stocks of foreign issuers. Investments in foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the United States, including expropriation, armed conflict, confiscatory taxation, lack of uniform accounting and auditing
	standards, less publicly available financial and other information, and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations. Investments in foreign issuers can also be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and political,
	economic and market developments abroad, including the imposition of economic and other sanctions by the United States or another country. Economic data as reported by sovereign governments and foreign issuers may be delayed, inaccurate or
	fraudulent. Because foreign issuers may not be subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standard practices and requirements and regulatory measures comparable to those in the United States, there may be less publicly available
	information about such foreign issuers. Settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss, may be delayed, and are generally less frequent than in the United States. Foreign issuers may become subject to
	sanctions imposed by the United States or another country, which could result in the immediate freeze of the foreign issuers assets or securities. The imposition of such sanctions could impair the market value of the securities of such foreign
	issuers and limit the Portfolios ability to buy, sell, receive or deliver the securities.



	The purchase and sale of the foreign securities will
	occur in foreign securities markets. Certain of the factors stated above may make it impossible to buy or sell them in a timely manner or may adversely affect the value received on a sale of securities. Custody of certain of the securities in your
	Portfolio may be maintained by a global custody and clearing institution which has entered into a sub-custodian relationship with the Trustee. In addition, round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets. These round lot
	trading requirements could cause the proportional composition and diversification of your Portfolios securities to vary when your Portfolio purchases additional securities or sells securities to satisfy expenses or Unit redemptions. This could
	have a material impact on investment performance and portfolio composition.


	Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the value of
	stocks denominated in foreign currencies, and therefore, an investment in Units of the Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio. To illustrate, if a foreign stock rose 10% in price but the U.S. dollar gained 5% against the related
	foreign currency, a U.S. investors return in this illustration would be reduced to about 5%. This is because the foreign currency would buy fewer dollars or, conversely, a dollar would buy more of the foreign currency. Many foreign
	currencies have fluctuated widely against the U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency, investor perceptions of world or country economies, political instability, currency

	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	speculation by institutional investors, changes in government policies, buying and selling of currencies by central banks of countries, trade balances and changes in interest rates.





	Japanese Issuers.




	The Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude
	Portfolio may invest significantly in stocks issued by Japanese companies. Investment in these securities is fully exposed to Japans economic cycles, stock market valuations and currency, which could increase its risk. In addition, political,
	social, regulatory, economic or environmental events that occur in Japan may adversely affect the values of Japanese securities and thus your Portfolios holdings. The Japanese economy and equity markets could be adversely affected by pressure
	from trading partners  particularly the United States  to improve trade imbalances. Japans economy is also vulnerable to instability and economic and political problems of its trading partners in China and Southeast Asia. Despite a
	strengthening in the economic relationship between Japan and China, the countries political relationship has at times been strained in recent years. Japan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could
	therefore have a negative impact on the economy. Japanese securities may also be subject to lack of liquidity, taxation, government seizure of assets, different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of
	exchanges than in the U.S. Furthermore, the natural disasters that have impacted Japan in recent years, including earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons, and the ongoing recovery efforts have had a negative effect on Japans economy, and may
	continue to do so.






	French Issuers.

	International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio may invest significantly in stocks issued by companies located in France which may subject the Portfolio to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific to France. The French
	economy, along with certain other European Union (the EU) economies, experienced a significant economic slowdown during the financial crisis that began in 2007. Recently, new concerns emerged with respect to the economic outlook for
	certain EU countries, including France. As a result, the French economy has experienced significant volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn and rising government debt levels. Interest rates on Frances
	debt may rise to levels that make it difficult for it to service high debt levels without significant financial help from, among others, the European Central Bank and could potentially result in default. In addition, the French economy is dependent
	to a significant extent on the economies of certain key trading partners, including Germany and other Western European countries. Reduction in spending on French products and services, or changes in any of the economies may cause an adverse impact
	on the French economy. In addition, France may be subject to acts of terrorism. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports, and as a result, is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products.






	United Kingdom Issuers.




	The Eaton Vance International Dividend
	Fortitude Portfolio may invest significantly in stocks issued by companies located in the United Kingdom (U.K.). As a result, your Portfolio may be affected unfavorably by political developments, social instability, changes in government
	policies and other political and economic developments in the U.K. Investment in these securities is fully exposed to U.K. economic cycles, political developments, social instability, currency, changes in government policies and other economic and
	regulatory developments in the U.K. The U.K. is a member state of the EU, the establishment of which has had the effect of eliminating most remaining trade barriers between member nations and has created one of the largest common markets in the
	world. Although the U.K. has not adopted the common EU currency of the Euro, the European financial crisis has resulted in a weakened Euro which may affect the future financial condition of the U.K. The Sponsor cannot predict when or if the
	U.K. will convert to the Euro, or what impact, if any, the adoption of the Euro by the U.K. would have on any of the securities issued by U.K. companies in your Portfolio. As a large trading partner of the United States and other European countries,
	the U.K. may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of the United States or other European countries.






	Swiss Issuers.




	The Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude Portfolio may invest significantly in stocks issued by companies located in Switzerland.
	Investments in Swiss issuers may subject the Portfolio to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to Switzerland. International trade is a large component of the Swiss economy and Switzerland depends upon
	exports to generate economic growth. The Swiss economy relies on certain key trading partners in order to sustain continued economic growth. Switzerlands economic growth generally mirrors slowdowns and growth spurts experienced in other
	countries, including the United States and certain Western European countries. Switzerland has few natural resources and therefore, any fluctuation or shortage in the commodity markets could have a negative impact on the Swiss economy.






	Industry Risks.




	Your Portfolio may invest significantly in certain
	industries. Any negative impact on the related sector will have a greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio more broadly diversified over several sectors. Your Portfolio may be concentrated in one or more sectors. You should
	understand the risks of these sectors before you invest.

	Consumer Products Sector.



	Your
	Portfolio may invest significantly in the common stocks of consumer products companies, a category which includes consumer discretionary companies and consumer staples companies. General risks of these companies include the general state of the
	economy, intense competition, consumer spending trends, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, currency fluctuations, product liability litigation and increased governmental regulation. A decline in the economy that results in a reduction of
	consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits. Competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and
	gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers, but may require more sophisticated technology to remain competitive. A weak economy and its effect on consumer
	spending would adversely affect consumer product companies.





	Financials Sector.



	Your Portfolio may invest significantly in financial services companies. Companies in the financial services sector include: commercial banks, industrial banks, savings institutions, finance companies, diversified
	financial services companies, investment banking firms, securities brokerage houses, investment advisory companies, leasing companies, insurance companies and companies providing similar services. Due to the wide variety of companies in the
	financial services sector, they may behave and react in different ways in response to changes in economic and market conditions.



	Companies in the financial
	services sector are subject to several distinct risks. Such companies may be subject to systematic risk, which may result due to factors outside the control of a particular financial institution  like the failure of another, significant
	financial institution or material disruptions to the credit markets  that could adversely affect the ability of the financial institution to operate normally or may impair its financial condition. Financial services companies are typically
	affected by changes in interest rates, and may be disproportionally affected as a result of volatile and/ or rising interest rates. Certain financial services companies may themselves have concentrated portfolios, such as a high level of loans to
	real estate developers, which makes them vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry. Companies in this sector are often subject to credit risk, meaning they may have exposure to investments or agreements which under certain
	circumstances may lead to losses, e.g., sub-prime loans. Further, companies in the financial services sector are subject to intense competition.


	Companies in this
	sector are subject to regulatory risk, where certain financial services companies may suffer setbacks if regulators change the rules under which they operate. Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the
	Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and
	issues in the nations evolving financial system. It also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as systemic risk regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight, and federal consumer protection. The

	Dodd-Frank

	Act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come, including banks, thrifts, depository institution holding companies, mortgage lenders, insurance
	companies, industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and other securities and investment advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds, consumers, numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure. In particular, certain provisions of
	the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital requirements of certain financial services companies supervised by the Federal Reserve, resulting in such companies incurring generally higher deposit premiums. These types of regulatory changes may have
	adverse effects on certain issuers in your Portfolio, and could lead to decreases in such issuers profits or revenues. In many cases the full impact of the

	Dodd-Frank

	Act on a financial
	institutions business remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be completed. The Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, on the securities in your Portfolio
	or on the financial services industry in general.


	Commercial banks (including money center regional and community banks), savings and loan associations
	and holding companies of the foregoing are especially subject to adverse effects of volatile interest rates, concentrations of loans in particular industries or classifications (such as real estate, energy, or sub-prime mortgages), and significant
	competition. The profitability of these businesses is to a significant degree dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds. Economic conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings
	associations. Commercial banks and savings associations are subject to extensive federal and, in many instances, state regulation. Neither such extensive regulation nor the federal insurance of deposits ensures the solvency or profitability of
	companies in this industry, and there is no assurance against losses in securities issued by such companies.


	Insurance companies are particularly subject to
	government regulation and rate setting, potential anti-trust and tax law changes, and industry-wide pricing and competition cycles. Property and casualty insurance companies also may be affected by weather, terrorism, long-term climate changes, and
	other catastrophes. Life and health insurance companies may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates, including the effects of epidemics. Individual insurance companies may be exposed


	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	15


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	to reserve inadequacies, problems in investment portfolios (for example, real estate or junk bond holdings) and failures of reinsurance carriers.


	Many of the investment considerations discussed in connection with banks and insurance companies also apply to other financial services companies. These companies are
	subject to extensive regulation, rapid business changes, and volatile performance dependent on the availability and cost of capital and prevailing interest rates and significant competition. General economic conditions significantly affect these
	companies. Credit and other losses resulting from the financial difficulty of borrowers or other third parties have a potentially adverse effect on companies in this industry. Investment banking, securities brokerage and investment advisory
	companies are particularly subject to government regulation and the risks inherent in securities trading and underwriting activities.




	Health Care Sector.



	Your Portfolio may invest significantly in health care companies, including biotechnology companies. Health care companies include companies
	that offer limited products or services or that are at the research and developmental stage with no marketable or approved products or technologies. Many of these companies face substantial government regulations that can affect their prospects.
	Regulatory approvals (often entailing lengthy application and testing procedures) are also generally required before new drugs and certain medical devices and procedures may be introduced. Health care companies can also face risk of extensive
	competition and product liability litigation.



	The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable
	Care Act, collectively the Act) has had a significant impact on the health care sector. Significant provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most Americans, significant expansion in the number
	of Americans eligible for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector, and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance
	providers, including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Although the implementation of the Acts various provisions will take place over the next several years through 2018, health care companies will face
	continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs, possible downward pressure on prices charged, and other changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the
	Act on the Securities in your Portfolio. As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls
	(which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for competition in the provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care
	sector. The government could also reduce funding for health care related research.


	Many of the products and services of companies engaged in medical research and
	health care are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by progressive scientific and technological advances. The research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial.
	Additionally, such products are subject to risks such as the appearance of toxic effects following commercial introduction and manufacturing difficulties. Alternatively, failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial
	negative effect on a company and its stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other litigation. The enforcement of patent, trademark and other intellectual
	property laws will affect the value of many such companies.


	Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, the ability of the facility
	to provide required services, emphasis on outpatient services, management capabilities, competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
	unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs).




	Industrials Sector




	.



	Your Portfolio may invest significantly in industrials companies. General risks
	of industrial companies include the general state of the economy, intense competition, imposition of import controls, volatility in commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuation, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess
	capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, they may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, labor relations, government regulations and e-commerce
	initiatives. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Industrial companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries.
	Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization. Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment, aircraft order cancellations,
	disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel.



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3

	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	Agricultural equipment businesses may be influenced by fluctuations in farm income, farm commodity prices, government subsidies and weather conditions. The number of housing starts, levels of
	public and non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment manufacturers. Stocks of transportation companies are
	cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may negatively impact their
	businesses.




	Information Technology
	Sector




	.



	Your Portfolio may invest significantly in information technology companies. The information technology sector is generally made up of
	companies related to software and services, including developing software in various fields such as Internet-related services, applications, database management and personal entertainment, technology consulting and services, data processing and
	outsourcing, as well as development of hardware and equipment, computers, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment manufacturers. These companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology, short product life cycles, cyclical market
	patterns, falling prices and profits, competition from new market entrants and regular introduction of new and/or enhanced products.



	Information technology
	companies also face risks from dependence on certain suppliers and supplies, high research and development costs, patent termination, and government regulation. These companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or reduction in supply of
	components or loss of key customers and failure to comply with certain industry standards.


	An unexpected change in technology may also have a significant negative
	impact on a company. The failure of a company to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and subsequently introduce new products can have a negative impact on the companys results. Technology companies may also be smaller and/or less
	experienced with limited product lines, markets or resources. Also, stocks of certain Internet-based companies have high price-to-earnings ratios with little or no earnings histories. Information technology stocks tend to experience substantial
	price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume fluctuations are
	unrelated to the operating performance of a company.





	Concentration Risk.




	When at least 25% of a Portfolio is invested in securities issued by companies within a single sector, the Portfolio is considered to be concentrated in that particular sector. As a result, such a Portfolio may be subject
	to greater risks of adverse economic, business or political developments than a trust that invests in a wider variety of sectors.






	Sustainable Impact Investing Risk.




	The Eaton Vance Sustainable Impact Portfolio invests in securities of companies considered to have demonstrated a
	commitment to their sustainability and impact practices, as determined through analysis of environmental, social and governance factors. As a result, the Portfolio may through the initial selection process forego some market opportunities available
	to a portfolio that does not use these criteria. The Portfolios focus on sustainable impact investments may affect its exposure to certain sectors or issuers, and may impact its relative investment performance, positively or negatively,
	depending on whether such sectors or issuers are in or out of favor in the market.






	Smaller Company
	Equity Risk.




	The Eaton Vance International Dividend Fortitude may invest in stocks of small capitalization and mid capitalization (collectively smaller cap) companies. The stocks of smaller
	cap companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than the stocks of larger, more established companies. Smaller cap companies may have limited product lines,
	markets or financial resources, may be dependent on a limited management group, and may lack substantial capital reserves or an established performance record. There may be generally less publicly available information about such companies than for
	larger, more established companies.






	Legislation/Litigation Risk.




	From time to time, various legislative initiatives are proposed in the United States and abroad that may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in your Portfolio, or on the tax treatment of your
	Portfolio or of your investment in a Portfolio. In addition, litigation regarding any of the issuers of the Securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these Securities. No one can predict
	what impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the Securities.






	Liquidity Risk






	.




	Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if
	trading in the security is limited or absent. Whether or not the stocks in your Portfolio are listed on a stock exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a
	liquid trading market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. In the absence of a liquid trading market for a particular security, the price at which



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	17


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	such security may be sold to meet redemptions, as well as the value of the Units of such corresponding Portfolio, may be adversely affected. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will
	exist for any security.





	No FDIC
	Guarantee






	.




	An investment in your Portfolio is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
	Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.







	Purchasing Units







	Public
	Offering






	.


	Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which consists of the net asset value per Unit plus organization costs plus the
	sales charge. The net asset value per Unit is the value of the securities, cash and other assets in your Portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the Portfolio divided by the total Units outstanding. The maximum sales charge equals 3.95% of the
	Public Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase.



	You pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy Units. The initial sales charge is the
	difference between the total sales charge percentage (maximum of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit) and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee. The initial sales
	charge will be approximately 1.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit depending on the Public Offering Price per Unit. The deferred sales charge is fixed at $0.245 per Unit. Your Portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as
	described under Fees and Expenses. If any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day, we will charge the payment on the next business day. If you purchase Units after the initial deferred sales charge payment, you will only
	pay that portion of the payments not yet collected. If you redeem or sell your Units prior to collection of the total deferred sales charge, you will pay any remaining deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your Units. The initial and
	deferred sales charges are referred to as the transactional sales charge. The transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee, which compensates the Sponsor for creating and developing your Portfolio and is
	described under Fees and Expenses. The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per Unit. Your Portfolio pays the creation and development fee as of the close of the initial offering period as described under Fees and
	Expenses. If you redeem or sell your Units prior to collection of the creation and development fee, you will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your Units. Because the deferred sales charge and creation and
	development fee are fixed dollar amounts per Unit, the actual charges will exceed the percentages shown under Fees and Expenses if the Public Offering Price per Unit falls below $10 and will be less than the percentages shown under
	Fees and Expenses if the Public Offering Price per Unit exceeds $10. In no event will the maximum total sales charge exceed 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.


	Since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit regardless of any
	decrease in net asset value. However, if the Public Offering Price per Unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and
	creation and development fee, your initial sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy Units. In such a situation, the value of securities per Unit would exceed
	the Public Offering Price per Unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value of those securities will fluctuate, which could result in a benefit or detriment to Unitholders that purchase Units at that price. The initial sales
	charge credit is paid by the Sponsor and is not paid by your Portfolio. The Fees and Expenses section shows the sales charge calculation at a $10 Public Offering Price per Unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at
	prices below and above $10. If the Public Offering Price per Unit fell to $6, the maximum sales charge would be $0.2370 (3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit), which consists of an initial sales charge of -$0.0580, a deferred sales charge of
	$0.245 and a creation and development fee of $0.05. If the Public Offering Price per Unit rose to $14, the maximum sales charge would be $0.5530 (3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit), consisting of an initial sales charge of $0.2580, a
	deferred sales charge of $0.245 and the creation and development fee of $0.05.


	The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the
	sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.


	The minimum purchase
	is 100 Units (25 Units for retirement accounts) but may vary by selling firm. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.





	Reducing Your Sales Charge



	.







	The Sponsor offers
	a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units. Before you purchase Units you must also inform your financial
	professional of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge. As further described in this section, purchases executed on the same day by a single person at the same broker-dealer may be
	combined for sales charge discount calculation purposes. Secondary market purchases are



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	18


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	excluded for purposes of sales charge discount calculations. Since the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these
	amounts per Unit regardless of any discounts. However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee, you will receive
	a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy Units.




	Large Quantity Purchases.



	You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment. Based upon the aggregate dollar amount of Units purchased
	by a Unitholder in the initial offering period, the following tables show both the corresponding sales charge and the concession or agency commission allowed to broker-dealers and other selling agents on such a transaction.

	Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to purchases of a single Portfolio made by the same person on a
	single day from a single broker-dealer. We apply these sales charges as a percent of the Public Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase. The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which
	cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units will be issued. Additional information regarding the broker-dealer concession or agency commission is presented in the Distribution of Units  Unit
	Distribution section.


	For purposes of achieving these levels, you may combine certain purchases made on the same day through a single broker-dealer or
	selling agent, as further described below. You must inform your broker- dealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge. For purposes of achieving the quantity discount levels in the above table, Units
	of a Portfolio offered in this prospectus may be combined with (i) purchases of units of any other Eaton Vance-sponsored unit investment trusts during each trusts initial offering period, (ii) purchases of units made as described
	under the Fee Accounts paragraph in this section, and (iii) purchases of units eligible for the sales charge discounts described under the Rollovers and Exchanges paragraph in this section. In addition, Units purchased
	in the name of your spouse (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) or children (including step-children) under 21 living in the same household as you will be deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the
	applicable quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust, estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or fiduciary account.




	Fee Accounts.



	Investors may purchase Units through registered
	investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in
	connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge (Wrap Fee) is imposed (Fee Accounts). You should consult your financial professional to determine whether you
	can benefit from these accounts. If Units of a Portfolio are purchased for a Fee Account and the Portfolio is subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e., the Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible), then the purchase will not be subject to the transactional
	sales charge but will be subject to the creation and development fee of $0.05 per Unit that is retained by the Sponsor. The table below illustrates the sales charge you will pay if a Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible as a percentage of the $10 initial
	Public Offering Price per Unit on the Initial Date of Deposit (the percentage will vary thereafter).

	The Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or selling firms whose
	frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a Portfolio. As described above in Large Quantity Purchases, Units purchased for a Fee Account may be combined with certain other purchases for purposes of achieving the
	quantity discount levels presented in the table above under Large Quantity Purchases, however, such Wrap Fee Eligible Units are not eligible for any sales charge discounts in addition to that which is described in this Fee
	Accounts section. To purchase Units in these Fee Accounts, your financial professional must purchase Units designated with one of the Wrap Fee CUSIP numbers set forth under Essential Information, either Wrap Fee Cash for cash
	distributions or Wrap Fee Reinvest for the reinvestment of distributions in additional Units, if available. See Rights of Unitholders  Reinvestment Option.




	Rollovers and Exchanges.



	During the initial offering period of the
	Portfolios offered in this prospectus, unitholders of any Eaton Vance-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such trusts to purchase Units of
	the Portfolios offered in this prospectus, or units of any other Eaton Vance-sponsored unit investment trust in its initial offering period, at a reduced sales charge. For such aggregated purchases of less than $500,000, Units may be purchased at
	the Public Offering Price per Unit less 1.00%. For such aggregated purchases of $500,000 or more, either made solely with redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts or in combination with other purchases as described above
	under Large Quantity Purchases, Units will be eligible for the applicable quantity discount level presented in the table that appears in that subsection. For aggregated purchases described above in the Large Quantity
	Purchases subsection that consist of any units other than Units of any Portfolio in this prospectus, please refer to the prospectus of the applicable Eaton Vance-sponsored unit investment trust for information regarding the specified sales
	charge reductions on those units. In order to be eligible for the sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases made with redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts, the trade date of each rollover or redemption, or
	each other trusts termination date resulting in the receipt of such proceeds used to purchase Units of your Portfolio must all be derived from transactions that occurred within 30 calendar days prior to your Unit purchase. In addition, the
	discounts will only be available for investors that utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the termination or redemption
	proceeds used for the Unit purchase. You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge discounts. If you purchase units of your Portfolio
	in this manner using redemption proceeds from trusts that assess the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales charge remaining on units of such trusts will be deducted from those
	redemption proceeds. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on the redemption or termination of an interest in a trust.





	Employees.



	Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or step-children under 21
	living in the same household, parents or step-parents and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of the Sponsor and its affiliates, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less
	the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are
	eligible for the discounts.





	Distribution Reinvestments.



	We do
	not charge any sales charge when you reinvest distributions from your Portfolio into additional Units of your Portfolio. Because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge
	these amounts per Unit regardless of this discount. If you elect to reinvest distributions, the Sponsor will credit you with additional Units with a dollar value sufficient to cover the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge and creation and
	development fee that will be collected on such Units at the time of reinvestment. The dollar value of these Units will fluctuate over time.






	Unit Price



	.







	The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts stated under Essential Information in
	accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in your Portfolio. The initial price of the Securities upon deposit by the Sponsor was determined by the Evaluator, Eaton Vance Management, an affiliate of the Sponsor.
	Subsequently, the Evaluator will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York
	Stock Exchange on each business day. The term business day, as used herein and under Selling Units  Redemption of Units, means any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading. The Public
	Offering Price per Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the
	Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial
	professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	20


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
	transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.





	Value of the
	Securities.




	Exchange-listed securities normally are valued at closing sale prices. When a market price is not readily available, including circumstances under which the Evaluator determines that a
	securitys market price is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined under procedures established by the Evaluator or an independent pricing service used by the Evaluator. In these cases, a Portfolios
	net asset value will reflect certain portfolio securities fair value rather than their market price. With respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value of the portfolio securities may change on days when you
	will not be able to purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will provide price dissemination and oversight services to your Portfolio.






	Organizational Costs.




	During the initial offering
	period, part of the Public Offering Price represents an amount that will pay the costs incurred in establishing your Portfolio. These costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to your Portfolio (such as the registration statement,
	prospectus, trust agreement and legal documents), federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and the initial audit. Your Portfolio will sell securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial
	offering period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will decline when your Portfolio pays these costs.






	Retirement Accounts





	.

	Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual
	Retirement Accounts for individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit sharing plans for employees. The minimum purchase for these accounts is
	reduced to 25 Units but may vary by selling firm. The purchase of Units may be limited by the plans provisions and does not itself establish such plans.







	Selling Units







	Market for Units



	.







	The Sponsor does not intend to but may maintain a market for Units after the close of the initial offering period
	and may continuously offer to purchase Units at the secondary market repurchase price (which is described in the Redemption of Units section below). The Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue purchases at this price at
	any time. In the event that a secondary market is not maintained, a Unitholder will be able to redeem Units with the Trustee at the Redemption Price. See Redemption of Units immediately below. Unitholders should contact their financial
	professional to determine the current and best price for Units in the secondary market. Units sold prior to the time the entire deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge at the time
	of sale. The Trustee will notify the Sponsor of any Units tendered for redemption. If the Sponsor maintains a market for Units and the Sponsors bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, it may purchase the
	Units not later than the day on which Units would have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Sponsor may sell repurchased Units at the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.






	Redemption of Units



	.







	All or a portion of your
	Units may be tendered to The Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be
	charged by the Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your
	bank or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed
	on the date of tender. The date of tender is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a business day,
	the date of tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests
	received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It
	is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for
	processing redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.



	Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units (or such
	higher amount as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent) for redemption may request an in-kind distribution of Securities equal to the Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender.


	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	21


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	Unitholders may not request an in-kind distribution during the initial offering period or within 30 calendar days of a Portfolios termination. The Portfolios generally will not offer
	in-kind distributions of portfolio securities that are held in foreign markets. An in-kind distribution will be made by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the account of the Unitholders
	broker-dealer at DTC. Amounts representing fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number of shares of any Security included in a Unitholders in-kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole
	shares. The in-kind distribution option may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Unitholder requesting an in-kind distribution is the Sponsor or an affiliated person of your Portfolio, the
	Trustee may make an in-kind distribution to such Unitholder provided that no one with a pecuniary incentive to influence the in-kind distribution may influence selection of the distributed securities, the distribution must consist of a pro rata
	distribution of all portfolio securities (with limited exceptions) and the in-kind distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the detriment of any other Unitholder.


	The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent that Securities are redeemed in-kind or sold, the size of a Portfolio will be, and the
	diversity of the Portfolio may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less than the
	amount paid by the Unitholder depending on the value of the Securities at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result if a Unitholder requests an in-kind distribution. See Tax Information.


	The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in your Portfolio determined on the basis
	of (i) the cash on hand in the Portfolio, (ii) the value of the Securities in the Portfolio and (iii) dividends or other income distributions receivable on the Securities in the Portfolio trading ex-dividend as of the date of
	computation, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Portfolio, (b) the accrued expenses of the Portfolio (including costs associated with liquidating securities after the end of the initial
	offering period) and (c) any unpaid deferred sales charge payments. During the initial offering period, the redemption price and the secondary market repurchase price will not be reduced by estimated organization costs or the creation and
	development fee. For these purposes, the Evaluator will determine the value of the Securities as described under Purchasing Units  Unit Price.


	The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary weekend and
	holiday closings, or any period during which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determines that trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not
	reasonably practicable, or for other periods as the SEC may permit.





	Exchange
	Option



	.







	When you redeem Units of your Portfolio or when your Portfolio terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Eaton Vance unit trusts at a reduced
	sales charge. You should contact your financial professional for more information about trusts currently available for exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new trust carefully and understand the risks and fees.
	You should then discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences. An exchange is a taxable event to you. We may discontinue
	this option at any time.






	Rollover



	.







	We may offer a subsequent series of each Portfolio for a Rollover when the Portfolios terminate. On the Mandatory Termination Date you will have the option to (1) participate in a Rollover and have your Units reinvested into a subsequent trust
	series or (2) receive a cash distribution.



	If you elect to participate in a cash Rollover, your Units will be redeemed on the Mandatory Termination
	Date. As the redemption proceeds become available, the proceeds (including dividends) will be invested in a new trust series at the public offering price for the new trust. The Trustee will attempt to sell Securities to satisfy the redemption as
	quickly as practicable on the Mandatory Termination Date. We do not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than one day, however, certain factors could affect the ability to sell the Securities and could impact the length of the sale period.
	The liquidity of any Security depends on the daily trading volume of the Security and the amount available for redemption and reinvestment on any day.


	We may make
	subsequent trust series available for sale at various times during the year. Of course, we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the same investment strategies or
	objectives as the current Portfolios. We cannot guarantee that a Rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences resulting from trading large volumes of securities. Market price trends may make it advantageous to sell or buy securities
	more quickly or more slowly than permitted by a Portfolios procedures. We may, in our sole discretion, modify a Rollover or stop creating units of a trust at any time regardless of whether all proceeds of Unitholders have been reinvested in a
	Rollover. If we decide not to offer a subsequent series, Unitholders will be notified prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. Cash which has


	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	22


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	not been reinvested in a Rollover will be distributed to Unitholders shortly after the Mandatory Termination Date. Rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or realize taxable capital
	gains which are reinvested in connection with a Rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the wash sale tax rules. Due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust, no cash will be distributed to pay any
	taxes. See Tax Information.


	Repeatedly rolling over an investment in a unit investment trust will differ from long-term investments in other
	investment products when considering the sales charges, fees, expenses and tax consequences attributable to a unitholder. Unlike many other investment products, unit investment trusts have finite lives, meaning that investors seeking to pursue a
	unit investment trust strategy over a multi-year period must periodically roll their proceeds into a newly formed trust. With each rollover event, unitholders will be subject to the tax consequences and expenses associated with redeeming units, as
	well as the reduced sales charge applicable to rollover investments. Fees and expenses may vary significantly not only among various unit investment trust products, but also when comparing unit investment trusts against other investment products
	such as mutual funds. To allow for such a cost comparison, the Fees and Expenses  Example section provides an illustrated example of the potential costs a unitholder may bear if an initial investment and subsequent rollover
	investments are made over various time periods, using the assumptions stated in that section.






	Distribution of Units







	Unit Distribution.




	Units will be distributed to the public by the
	Sponsor, broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price. Units repurchased in the secondary market, if any, may be offered by this prospectus at the secondary market Public Offering Price in the manner described above. The Sponsor intends to
	qualify Units of the Portfolios for sale in all states of the United States where qualification is deemed necessary by the Sponsor. This prospectus does not constitute an offer of Units in any state or country where Units cannot be offered or sold
	lawfully. The Portfolios do not accept investments from non-U.S. residents, provided that a Portfolio may accept investments from certain non-U.S. investors at the discretion of the Sponsor.





	Unit Sales Concessions.



	Brokers, dealers and others will be allowed a
	regular concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of Units during the initial offering period as set forth in the Broker-Dealer Concession or Agency Commission column of the table under Reducing Your Sales
	Charge  Large Quantity Purchases. For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase Units of the Portfolios, the regular concession or agency commission
	will be 2.15% per Unit for such transactions amounting to less than $500,000. For such transactions of $500,000 or more, the regular concession or agency commission, will equal the applicable percentage listed in the table that appears under
	Purchasing Units  Large Quantity Purchases.





	Volume Concession Based Upon Annual
	Sales.



	As described below, broker-dealers and other selling agents may in certain cases be eligible for an additional concession based upon their annual eligible sales of all Eaton Vance-sponsored unit
	investment trusts. Eligible sales include all units of any Eaton Vance unit investment trust purchased directly from Eaton Vance during a trusts initial offering period. In addition to the regular concessions or agency commissions described
	above in Unit Sales Concessions all broker-dealers and other selling firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total initial offering period sales of all eligible Eaton Vance unit investment trusts during the
	previous consecutive 12-month period through the end of the most recent month. The Volume Concession, as applicable to equity and fixed income trust units, is set forth in the following table:

	Broker-dealers and other selling firms will not receive the Volume Concession on the sale of units purchased in Fee
	Accounts, however, such sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set forth in the Volume Concession table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for purposes of the
	Volume Concession. Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing firms that place orders with Eaton Vance and provide Eaton Vance with information with respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible dealer
	firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely provide clearing services to other broker-dealer firms or firms who place orders through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We reserve the right to change the amount of the
	concessions or agency commissions from time to time. For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation, the trusts prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional compensation.




	Additional Information.



	Except as provided in this section, any sales
	charge discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling broker-dealer or agent. For all secondary market transactions the total concession or agency commission will amount to 80% of the sales charge. Notwithstanding anything to the
	contrary herein, in no case shall the total of any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any individual transaction exceed the total sales
	charge applicable to such transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others from time to time.



	We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of these Portfolios and
	our other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related expenses,
	including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the
	Portfolios and our other products. Fees may include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars of a business nature. Payments of such
	additional compensation, some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing, may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products, including your Portfolio, over products offered by
	other sponsors or fund companies. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your Units.





	Sponsor Compensation.




	The Sponsor will receive the total sales
	charge applicable to each transaction. Except as provided under Unit Distribution above, any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or loss
	as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to a Portfolio on the Initial Date of Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. See Notes to Portfolios. The Sponsor
	has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates or as an agent in a private placement for any of the Securities. The Sponsor may realize profit or loss as a result of fluctuations in the market
	value of Units held by the Sponsor for sale to the public. If the Sponsor maintains a secondary market, the Sponsor will realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
	Units are resold (which price includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase
	of Units may be used in the Sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



	The Sponsor or an affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have a long or
	short position in these Securities or related securities. An affiliate may act as a specialist or market maker for these Securities. An officer, director or employee of the Sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or director for issuers of the
	Securities.






	Rights of Unitholders







	Distributions.




	Dividends and interest (prorated on an annual basis
	in the case of the Eaton Vance Sustainable Impact Portfolio), net of expenses, and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities received by a Portfolio will generally be distributed on each Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding
	Record Date. These dates appear under Essential Information. In addition, your Portfolio will generally make required distributions at the end of each year in order to satisfy a requirement for qualification as a regulated
	investment company for federal tax purposes. Unitholders will also receive a final distribution of income when their Portfolio terminates. In some cases, your Portfolio may pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash
	pending distribution. For example, this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	24


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	involving a company whose stock is in your Portfolio. A person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may
	elect to receive distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units. See Rights of Unitholders  Reinvestment Option.


	Dividends and interest received by a Portfolio are credited to the Income Account of the Portfolio. Other receipts (

	e.g

	., capital gains, proceeds from the sale
	of Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or pay deferred sales charges, fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders.
	Proceeds received from the disposition of any Securities after a Record Date and prior to the following Distribution Date will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders
	consists of each Unitholders pro rata share of the available cash in the Income and Capital Accounts as of the related Record Date.


	The income distribution
	to the Unitholders of the Eaton Vance Sustainable Impact Portfolio as of each Record Date will be made on the following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of each
	Unitholders pro rata share of the estimated net annual income distributions in the Income Account. Because income payments are not received by these Portfolios at a constant rate throughout the year, such distributions to Unitholders may be
	more or less than the amount credited to the Income Account as of the Record Date. For the purpose of minimizing fluctuation in the distributions from the Income Account, the Trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to
	provide income distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee shall be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds in the Income Account on the ensuing Record Date.





	Estimated Distributions.




	The estimated net annual distributions per
	Unit may be shown under Essential Information. Generally, the estimate of the distributions your Portfolio may receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an issuer, the most recent interim and final
	dividends declared for certain foreign issuers, or scheduled income payments (in all cases accounting for any applicable foreign withholding taxes). In certain cases, estimated net annual distributions may also be based upon several recently
	declared dividends of an issuer. However, common stocks do not assure dividend payments and therefore the amount of future dividend income to your Portfolio is uncertain. The actual net annual distributions may decrease over time because a portion
	of the Securities included in a Portfolio will be sold to pay for the organization costs, deferred sales charge and creation and development fee. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during your Portfolios life.
	Dividend and income conventions for certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over several years or other periods may be used to
	estimate annual distributions. The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in a Portfolios fees and expenses, in actual income received by a Portfolio, currency fluctuations and
	with changes in a Portfolio such as the acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to these and various other factors, actual distributions received by your Portfolio will most likely differ from the most recent dividends or scheduled
	income payments.






	Reinvestment Option.




	Unitholders may
	have distributions automatically reinvested in additional Units without a sales charge (to the extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the Unitholder resides). The CUSIP numbers for either Cash distributions
	or Reinvest for the reinvestment of distributions are set forth under Essential Information. Brokers and dealers can use the Dividend Reinvestment Service through Depository Trust Company (DTC) or purchase Units
	with a Reinvest CUSIP (or Wrap Fee Reinvest CUSIP in the case of Wrap Fee Eligible Units held in Fee Accounts), if available. To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder must file with the Trustee a written notice of election, together
	with any other documentation that the Trustee may then require, at least five days prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholders election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in effect until changed by the
	Unitholder. The reinvestment option is not offered during the 30 calendar days prior to termination. If Units are unavailable for reinvestment or this reinvestment option is no longer available, distributions will be paid in cash. Distributions will
	be taxable to Unitholders if paid in cash or automatically reinvested in additional Units. See Tax information.



	A participant may elect to
	terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor shall have the right to suspend or terminate the reinvestment plan at
	any time. The reinvestment plan is subject to availability or limitation by each broker-dealer or selling firm. Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment plan at any time. Please contact your financial professional for
	additional information.





	Units.




	Ownership of Units is evidenced
	in book-entry form only and will not be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account of your bank or



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	25


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016








	broker-dealer

	at DTC. Units are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements
	therefor, will be governed by the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.





	Reports Provided.




	Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends
	and other amounts received by a Portfolio for each distribution. Within a reasonable time after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual
	Portfolio distributions, Portfolio expenses, a list of the Securities and other Portfolio information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your Portfolio,
	please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.







	Trust Administration







	Trust Supervision.




	The
	Portfolios are not managed funds and, except as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold or replaced. The Sponsor may, however, direct that Securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect a Portfolio
	based on advice from the Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a Security has declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so
	that in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would be detrimental to a Portfolio. If a public tender offer has been made for a Security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the Trustee may either
	sell the Security or accept an offer if the Supervisor determines that the sale or exchange is in the best interest of Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to redeem
	Units or pay Portfolio expenses or deferred sales charges. If securities or property are acquired by a Portfolio, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the
	securities or property for deposit in the Portfolio. Should any contract for the purchase of any of the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the moneys held in a Portfolio to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute
	Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the next Distribution Date.



	The Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of Securities if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion
	of the Sponsor, would make retention of the Securities detrimental to your Portfolio. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in
	your Portfolio on the Initial Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that your Portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid imposition of tax
	on undistributed income of the Portfolio.


	The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the Securities held in your Portfolio. While you may sell or redeem
	your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in your Portfolio. The Trustee will vote the Securities in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.


	When your Portfolio sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the Securities in the Portfolio may be altered. However, if the Trustee sells Securities to
	redeem Units or to pay Portfolio expenses or sales charges, the Trustee will do so, as nearly as practicable, on a pro rata basis. In order to obtain the best price for your Portfolio, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum
	amounts in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities, the Sponsor may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated
	with a Portfolio, the Sponsor or dealers participating in the offering of Units.





	Amendment of the Trust
	Agreement.




	The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not
	materially adversely affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or permit acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the
	Securities (except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.






	Termination.




	Your Portfolio will terminate on the Mandatory
	Termination Date specified under Essential Information or upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in your Portfolio. Your Portfolio may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing two-thirds of
	the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the Portfolio is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Portfolio has exceeded $15,000,000) (the Minimum Termination Value). Your Portfolio will be liquidated by the
	Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Portfolio not yet sold are tendered



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	26


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Portfolio would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited in the Portfolio. If your
	Portfolio is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a
	Portfolio termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory Termination Date. Qualified Unitholders may elect an in-kind distribution of Securities, provided that Unitholders may not request an in-kind distribution of
	Securities within 30 calendar days of a Portfolios termination. Any in-kind distribution of Securities will be made in the manner and subject to the restrictions described under Selling Units  Redemption of Units,
	provided that, in connection with an in-kind distribution election more than 30 calendar days prior to termination, Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units of a Portfolio (or such higher amount as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling
	agent) may request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders will receive a final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the Mandatory Termination Date. All
	distributions will be net of Portfolio expenses and costs. Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following termination.





	Limitations on Liabilities.




	The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee are under no liability for taking any action or for refraining from taking any
	action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or
	by reason of their reckless disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee is not liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to
	act under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is not liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Securities, on
	it as Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Portfolio which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust Agreement
	contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee. The Trustee and Unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Evaluator
	shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.






	Sponsor.




	Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc. is the Sponsor of your
	Portfolio. The Sponsors principal office is located at Two International Place, Boston, Massachusetts. The Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. (EVC). EVC has a history dating to 1924, offering individuals and
	institutions a broad array of investment strategies and wealth management solutions. EVC and its affiliates currently manage over $300 billion in assets on behalf of mutual funds, institutional clients and individuals.



	The Sponsor and your Portfolio have adopted a code of ethics requiring employees who have access to information on Portfolio transactions to report personal securities
	transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your Portfolio.


	If
	the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a successor Sponsor at
	rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the SEC, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate your Portfolio as provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without
	terminating the Trust Agreement.





	Trustee.




	The Trustee is The
	Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217,
	(800) 856-8487. If you have questions regarding your account or your Portfolio, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account
	information. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
	Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. The Trustee or any successor may resign upon notice to the Sponsor. The Trustee may be removed by the Sponsor without the consent of any of the Unitholders if the Trustee becomes incapable of
	acting or becomes bankrupt or its affairs are taken over by public authorities. Such resignation or removal shall become effective upon the acceptance of appointment by the successor. In case of such resignation or removal the Sponsor is to use its
	best efforts to appoint a successor promptly and if upon resignation of the Trustee no successor has accepted appointment within thirty days after notification, the Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
	successor.

	Supervisor and
	Evaluator.




	Eaton Vance Management, an affiliate of the Sponsor, serves as Supervisor and Evaluator. The Supervisor or Evaluator may resign or be removed by the Sponsor or Trustee in which event the
	Sponsor or Trustee shall use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor. Such resignation or removal shall be effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor. If upon resignation no successor has accepted appointment within
	thirty days after notice of resignation, the Supervisor or Evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor. Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be mailed by the Trustee to each
	Unitholder. As Evaluator, Eaton Vance Management may utilize an independent pricing service to perform certain evaluation services.







	Tax Information




	This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning Units of the Portfolios as of the date of this prospectus. Tax laws and
	interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and this summary does not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, this summary generally does not describe your situation if you are a corporation,
	a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, financial institution, person who marks to market their Units or other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your alternative minimum, state, local
	or foreign tax consequences of investing in a Portfolio.


	This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal
	Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your Portfolio.


	As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor.





	Portfolio Status.




	Your Portfolio intends to elect and to qualify
	annually as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws. If your Portfolio qualifies under the tax law as a regulated investment company and distributes its income consistently with such qualification, the Portfolio
	generally will not pay federal income taxes. But there is no assurance that the distributions made by your Portfolio will eliminate all taxes for every year at the level of your Portfolio.






	Distributions.




	Portfolio distributions are generally taxable. After
	the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement reporting your Portfolios distributions, including the amounts of ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your tax
	rate for ordinary income, however, as further discussed below, certain ordinary income distributions received from your Portfolio may be taxed, under current federal law, at the capital gains tax rates. Certain ordinary income dividends on Units
	that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your Portfolio from certain corporations may be reported by the Portfolio as being eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate Unitholders provided certain holding period
	requirements are met. Income from the Portfolio and gains on the sale of your Units may also be subject to a 3.8% federal tax imposed generally on net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are
	$250,000 in the case of married couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals. In addition, your Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the
	Unitholders basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units.
	The tax status of your distributions from your Portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional Units or receive them in cash. The income from your Portfolio that you must take into account for federal income tax
	purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 of the previous year.



	A distribution paid by your Portfolio reduces the Portfolios net asset value per Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly, a
	distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would represent, in substance, a partial return of capital, however, it would be subject to income taxes.





	Sale or Redemption of Units.




	If you sell or redeem your Units, you
	will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is generally
	equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units.



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	28


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016










	Capital Gains and Losses and Certain Ordinary Income
	Dividends.







	Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term capital loss for the
	taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you purchase your Units to determine your
	holding period. However, if you receive a capital gain dividend from your Portfolio and sell your Units at a loss after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain
	dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income.


	In certain
	circumstances, ordinary income dividends received by an individual Unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your Portfolio may be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain holding
	period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Portfolio itself. Your Portfolio will provide notice to its Unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken
	into account as qualified dividend income which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates. There is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in administering your Portfolio.





	In-Kind Distributions.




	Under certain circumstances, as described in
	this prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of Portfolio securities when you redeem your Units. In general, this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss, based on the
	value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received, and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax rules. Unitholders will incur transaction costs in liquidating securities received in an in-kind
	distribution, and any such securities received will be subject to market risk until sold. In the event that any securities received in-kind are illiquid, Unitholders will bear the risk of not being able to sell such securities in the near term, or
	at all.






	Rollovers and Exchanges.




	If you elect to have
	your proceeds from your Portfolio rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and, in general, any loss will be treated as a capital loss.
	However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after
	disposition of Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to
	reflect the disallowed loss.






	Deductibility of Portfolio Expenses



	.







	Expenses incurred and deducted by your Portfolio will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases, however, you may be required to treat your portion of these Portfolio expenses as income. In these
	cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses. However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed 2% of the
	individuals adjusted gross income. Such deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels.






	Foreign Investors.




	If you are a foreign investor

	(i.e.,

	an investor other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership,
	estate or trust), generally, subject to applicable tax treaties, distributions to you from your Portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes (other than dividends that your Portfolio reports as capital gain dividends)
	and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below. You may be eligible under certain income tax treaties for a reduction in withholding rates. However, distributions received by a
	foreign investor from your Portfolio that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that your Portfolio makes certain elections and certain
	other conditions are met.






	The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
	(FATCA)



	.







	A 30% withholding tax on your Portfolios distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
	Units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence, reporting, withholding, and
	certification obligations, (ii) if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution, it identifies certain of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under FATCA. If required under the
	rules above and subject to the applicability of any intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign country, withholding under FATCA applies: (i) with respect to distributions from your Portfolio and
	(ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after January 1, 2019. If



	 
















	Eaton Vance Unit Trust  Series 3


	  


	29


	 


	Prospectus dated                 , 2016







	withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of
	withholding) on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Portfolio will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You
	should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual circumstances.





	Foreign
	Tax Credit



	.







	If your Portfolio invests in any foreign securities, the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your Portfolio paid to other countries.
	In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your Portfolio paid to other countries. You may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes if your Portfolio meets certain requirements for
	passing through such deductions or credits to you.






	Backup
	Withholding



	.







	By law, your Portfolio must withhold as backup withholding a percentage (currently 28%) of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not provide your
	correct social security or taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if the IRS instructs your Portfolio to do so.



	Investors should consult their advisors concerning the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of investing in a Portfolio.






	Trust Expenses







	General



	.







	The fees and expenses of your Portfolio will generally accrue on a daily basis. Portfolio operating fees and expenses are
	generally paid out of the Income Account to the extent funds are available, and then from the Capital Account. The deferred sales charge, creation and development fee and organization costs are generally paid out of the Capital Account of your
	Portfolio. It is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts which will result in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See Tax Information. These sales will reduce future income distributions. The Sponsors,
	Supervisors and Trustees fees may be increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category Services Less Rent of Shelter in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
	Consumers or, if this category is not published, in a comparable category.






	Organization
	Costs



	.







	You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the establishment of your Portfolio. These costs
	and charges will include the cost of the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration statement and other documents relating to your Portfolio, federal and state registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses
	of the Trustee, and legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering Price of Units includes the estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from your Portfolios assets at the end of the initial offering period.






	Creation and Development Fee



	.







	The
	Sponsor will receive a fee from your Portfolio for creating and developing the Portfolio, including determining the Portfolios objectives, policies, composition and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
	other similar administrative and ministerial functions. The creation and development fee is a charge of $0.05 per Unit. The Trustee will deduct this amount from your Portfolios assets as of the close of the initial offering period. No portion
	of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of Units before the close of the initial public
	offering period.






	Trustees
	Fee



	.







	For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from your Portfolio set forth under Fees and Expenses (which includes the estimated amount of miscellaneous
	Portfolio expenses). The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and the amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the
	Trustees compensation for its services to your Portfolio is expected to result from the use of these funds.






	Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor.




	The Sponsor and the Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fees for providing
	bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory services set forth under Fees and Expenses. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to your Portfolio but at no time will the total amount
	received for these services rendered to all Eaton Vance unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the aggregate cost of providing these services in that year.

	Miscellaneous Expenses



	.







	The following additional charges are or may be incurred by your Portfolio: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Portfolio,
	(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any
	action taken by the Trustee to protect the Portfolio and the rights and interests of Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or expenses incurred in the administration of the Portfolio without negligence, bad
	faith or willful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction fees (which may include compensation paid to the Trustee or its subsidiaries or affiliates), (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the
	Portfolio, (i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and (j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the Portfolio. Your Portfolio may pay the expenses of updating its
	registration statement each year.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
