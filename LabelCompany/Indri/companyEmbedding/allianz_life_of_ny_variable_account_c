Annuities
Today's annuities may help you live your retirement the way you want.





Annuities
    



An annuity is a financial vehicle that is designed to help you prepare for retirement. Simply put, an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company: You pay the insurance company premium, or purchase payments, and in exchange you get benefits only an annuity can provide.
Learn the ABCs of annuities
Why consider an annuity?
Annuities can be a valuable addition to your overall retirement strategy because they offer tax-deferred growth while you're saving for retirement, and dependable income after you retire – in some cases, for as long as you live.
Many annuities provide principal protection, lifetime income, an enhanced death benefit, and other options either built-in or optional and available for an additional cost. Plus, annuities can help you transfer wealth to your beneficiaries.
Heard the myths? Get the facts.
Which annuity may meet your needs?
Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York (Allianz Life of NY®) offers several variable annuities that might fit your needs. Variable annuities give you the possibility of potential based on the variable investment options you choose, but they will experience market ups and downs – so you could lose money, including principal.
Learn more about variable annuities
Annuities are complex products that include many features and factors. It is important to understand the balance between all features available with any annuity. You should consult with a financial professional to determine if an annuity is appropriate for your needs.









Check the background of Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC on FINRA's BrokerCheck.

Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of any protection benefits. Withdrawals taken within the contract withdrawal charge schedule will be subject to a withdrawal charge. All withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal additional tax.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions. 
• Not FDIC insured • May lose value • No bank or credit union guarantee • Not a deposit • Not insured by any federal government agency or NCUA/NCUSIF
Products are issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York, 28 Liberty Street, 38th Floor, New York, NY 10005-1422. Variable products are distributed by its affiliate, Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC, member FINRA, 5701 Golden Hills Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55416-1297.

The Replacement Fund is managed by PIMCO, an affiliate of the Insurance Company Applicants.
4. The Replaced Fund is a series of Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust (“FTVIPT”), a Delaware statutory trust.

The Replaced Fund is managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, which is not an affiliate of the Insurance Company Applicants.

7. Subaccounts investing in Class 1 shares of the Replaced Fund and Institutional Class shares of the Replacement Fund are available only to owners of certain Contracts that are no longer offered for sale by the Insurance Company Applicants. Pursuant to the proposed Substitution, the Insurance Company Applicants will replace shares of subaccounts investing in Class 1 shares of the Replaced Fund on the date of the Substitution with Institutional Class shares of the Replacement Fund.
8. Subaccounts investing in Class 2 shares of the Replaced Fund and Advisor Class shares of the Replacement Fund are available to owners of various Contracts, including Contracts that are no longer offered for sale and Contracts currently offered for sale by the Insurance Company Applicants. Pursuant to the proposed Substitution, the Insurance Company Applicants will replace shares of subaccounts investing in Class 2 shares of the Replaced Fund on the date of the Substitution with Advisor Class shares of the Replacement Fund.
9. It is currently anticipated that the Substitution will occur on or about July 22, 2011, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable following receipt of the requested Order of the Commission (the “Substitution Date”). Following the Substitution, the Replaced Fund will no longer be offered under any Contract issued by Allianz Life or Allianz NY.
10. Allianz Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota in 1896. Allianz Life offers fixed and variable annuities and individual life insurance. Allianz Life is licensed to do direct business in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Allianz Life is a subsidiary of Allianz SE, a “Societas Europaea” or European stock corporation.
11. Allianz NY is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of New York on September 21, 1982. Allianz NY offers fixed and variable annuities. Allianz NY is licensed to do direct business in six states, including New York and the District of Columbia.
12. Allianz Account A is a segregated asset account of Allianz Life. Allianz Account A was established by Allianz Life on May 31, 1985, under Minnesota insurance laws. Allianz Account A is used to fund certain variable life insurance policies issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account A is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific underlying registered investment company or portfolio thereof (each an “Investment Option”). Allianz Account A is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-04965).
13. Allianz Account B is a segregated asset account of Allianz Life. Allianz Account B was established by Allianz Life on May 31, 1985, under Minnesota insurance laws. Allianz Account B is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account B is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific Investment Option. Allianz Account B is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-05618).

18. In addition, Allianz NY has the following registration statements that are no longer updated for six Contracts funded by Allianz Account C (the “C Great Wested Contracts”). Although the C Great Wested Contracts are no longer offered for sale, they do offer the Replaced Fund as an Investment Option:

19. Of the Contracts that offer the Replaced Fund as an Investment Option, only Allianz Vision and Allianz Vision New York currently are offered for sale.
20. Under the Contracts, the Insurance Company Applicants reserve the right, subject to regulatory approval, to substitute one of the Investment Options with another Investment Option after appropriate notice. Moreover, the Contracts permit the Insurance Company Applicants to limit allocation of purchase payments to one or more subaccounts that invest in an Investment Option. The prospectuses for the Contracts also contain disclosure of these rights.
21. The proposed Substitution is due primarily to the fact that the Replacement Fund, which has the same investment objective and substantially similar investment strategies as the Replaced Fund, is managed by the same portfolio managers who previously managed the Replaced Fund. The Replacement Fund's portfolio is jointly managed by Anne Gudefin and Charles Lahr. Ms. Gudefin and Mr. Lahr were hired by PIMCO at the end of 2009, to manage the Replacement Fund on its inception in April, 2010; they previously served as the co-lead portfolio managers of the Replaced Fund since 2007. As a result, the Replacement Fund now is managed by the same portfolio managers, and with substantially the same mandate and value-oriented style, as the Replaced Fund prior to the transition. The Replaced Fund, on the other hand, now is managed by a new portfolio management team.
22. The proposed Substitution also is part of an overall business plan of the Insurance Company Applicants to make their respective products more efficient to monitor and administer and more competitive (both in terms of new sales and the retention of existing business). The Insurance Company Applicants believe that more concentrated and streamlined operations for Investment Options will result in increased operational and administrative efficiencies and economies of scale for the Insurance Company Applicants. Having added the Replacement Fund as an Investment Option to retain the ability for Contract holders to invest in a value-oriented fund managed by Ms. Gudefin and Mr. Lahr, the Insurance Company Applicants believe that it would enhance operational and administrative efficiency to replace the Replaced Fund, which, with the same mandate and value-oriented style as the Replacement Fund, is a largely redundant Investment Option.
23. For these reasons and the reasons discussed below, the Applicants believe that substituting the Replacement Fund for the Replaced Fund is appropriate and in the best interests of the contract owners.
24. The Insurance Company Applicants believe that the Replacement Fund is an appropriate replacement for the Replaced Fund because its investment objective is the same (both funds seek capital appreciation) and its principal investment strategies are substantially the same as those of the Replaced Fund. In addition, because the principal investment risks of the Replaced Fund and the Replacement Fund are substantially the same, the risk expectations of those contract owners with interests in the Replaced Fund will continue to be met after the Substitution. Comparisons of the investment objectives, principal investment policies and principal investment risks of the Funds are set forth in the application.
25. The following chart compares the management fees and the total annual fund operating expenses (before and after any waivers and reimbursements) for the year ended December 31, 2010, expressed as an annual percentage of average daily net assets, of the Replaced Fund and the Replacement Fund.

As compensation for these services, PIMCO receives a supervisory and administrative fee of 0.35%. In its prospectus, the Replacement Fund discloses this fee together with the investment advisory fee as a combined management fee of 1.10%. The expenses incurred by the Replaced Fund for similar administrative services are included under Other Expenses.(3) PIMCO has contractually agreed, through May 1, 2012, to reduce its advisory fee by 0.13% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio. This Fee Limitation Agreement renews annually unless terminated by PIMCO upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the end of the contract term. Under certain conditions, PIMCO may recoup amounts reduced in future periods, not exceeding three years.
26. The assets and performance of the Funds for the years ending December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010 are set forth in the application.
27. Applicants hereby request the Commission's approval to effect the substitution of shares of the Replacement Fund for shares of the Replaced Fund as follows: Institutional Class shares of the PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Portfolio for Class 1 shares of the Mutual Global Discovery Securities Fund; and Advisor Class shares of the PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Portfolio for Class 2 shares of the Mutual Global Discovery Securities Fund.
28. At the close of business on the Substitution Date, Allianz Life and Allianz NY will each redeem shares of the Replaced Fund held by their Separate Accounts in-kind or in cash, or a combination thereof, and apply the proceeds of such redemptions to the purchase of shares of the Replacement Fund. Thus, after the Substitution, each subaccount of the Separate Accounts previously holding shares of the Replaced Fund will hold shares of the Replacement Fund.
29. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that redemption of Replaced Fund shares and purchase of Replacement Fund shares will both occur at the price for such shares computed as of the close of business on the Substitution Date in a manner consistent with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. As a result, the full net asset value of the Replaced Fund shares held by the Separate Account Applicants will be reflected in the contract owners' contract values following the Substitution, without reduction for brokerage or other such fees or charges. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitution, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage commissions, will be paid by Allianz Life, Allianz NY or PIMCO. Accordingly, contract value attributable to contract owners then invested in the Replaced Fund will remain fully invested at all times, and the Substitution will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owner's contract value, death benefit, or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the applicable Separate Account.
30. Affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges in connection with the Substitution so that the net asset value of redeemed shares of the Replaced Fund held by the Separate Account Applicants will be reflected in the contract owners' contract values following the Substitution. Moreover, neither the obligations of the respective Insurance Company Applicants under the Contracts nor the rights of contract owners will be altered in any way by the Substitution. The Substitution will not impose any tax liability or have any adverse tax consequences on contract owners. The Substitution will not cause Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners of Contracts to be greater after the Substitution than they were before the Substitution. For a period of at least 30 days following the Substitution, neither Allianz Life nor Allianz NY will exercise any right they may have under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers.[1] 

31. The Insurance Company Applicants represent that PIMCO and the Replacement Fund will enter into a written contract agreeing that during the 24 months following the Substitution Date, the total annual fund operating expenses, net of any acquired fund fees and expenses, of the Replacement Fund (taking into account applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements) will not exceed the total annual fund operating expenses, net of any acquired fund fees and expenses, of the Replaced Fund for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010; this contractual expense limitation will be set at 1.00% for Institutional Class shares and 1.25% for Advisor Class shares. In addition, for the 24 months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Company Applicants will not increase separate account fees and charges for the Contracts outstanding on the Substitution Date. Thereafter, total annual fund operating expenses for the Replacement Fund will vary from year to year and may exceed those of the Replaced Fund.
32. Contract owners have been notified of the application by means of a Notice of Substitution sent on May 25, 2011, stating that the Applicants filed the initial application and seek approval for the Substitution. The Notice of Substitution set forth the anticipated Substitution Date and advised affected contract owners that on the Substitution Date contract values allocated to subaccounts investing in shares of the Replaced Fund will be transferred to subaccounts investing in shares of the Replacement Fund, without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without being counted toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge.
33. The Notice of Substitution also stated that, from the date of the Notice (May 25, 2011) through the date 30 days after the Substitution (the “Free Transfer Period”), the respective Insurance Company Applicants will allow the affected contract owners to make one transfer of contract value held in each subaccount investing in the Replaced Fund (before the Substitution) or Replacement Fund (after the Substitution) to one or more Investment Options available pursuant to the Contracts, subject to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under their Contract, without charge and without assessing transfer fees. Such a transfer will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the Contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge. Further, prior to the Substitution, all affected contract owners will receive a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Fund.
34. Within five days following the Substitution, the Insurance Company Applicants will send a Post-Substitution notice to affected contract owners stating that the Substitution was carried out and reiterating the information set forth in the Notice, including a reminder that the Free Transfer Period will continue through the date 30 days after the Substitution.Start Printed Page 35254

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
Section 26(c) Relief
1. Applicants submit that the Substitution does not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that Section 26(c) of the Act was intended to guard against and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act. The Substitution is consistent with contract owners' objectives and risk expectations because the investment objective, principal investment strategies and risks of the Replacement Fund are substantially similar to those of the Replaced Fund. In addition, the total annual fund operating expenses of the Replacement Fund will be no higher than those of the Replaced Fund, after applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements that will be in place for the Replacement Fund, for a period of at least 24 months following the Substitution.
2. Applicants represent that for a period of 24 months from the date of the Substitution, the PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Portfolio will be subject to an expense cap (1.00% for Institutional Class shares; 1.25% for Advisor Class shares) limiting its total annual fund operating expenses, net of any acquired fund fees and expenses, to an amount not to exceed the total annual fund operating expenses of the Mutual Global Discovery Securities Fund, net of any acquired fund fees and expenses, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, for the 24 months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Company Applicants will not increase separate account fees and charges for the Contracts outstanding on the Substitution Date
3. Owners of Contracts who are beneficial shareholders of the Replaced Fund have been provided with appropriate Notice of the Substitution and Free Transfer Period. No 12b-1 fees are assessed to Class 1 shares of the Replaced Fund or the Institutional Class shares of the Replacement Fund. Identical 12b-1 fees of 0.25% of average daily net assets are assessed to Class 2 shares of the Replaced Fund and the Advisor Class shares of the Replacement Fund.
4. Applicants submit that the investment objectives are the same and the investment strategies are substantially the same for both Funds; both primarily invest in equity securities (and securities convertible into, or that the adviser expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock) of issuers that the manager believes are undervalued. The risks are similar for both Funds and are consistent with the risks generally applicable to the types of securities (such as value-oriented equity securities, arbitrage securities and distressed companies and foreign securities) in which both funds invest.
5. In addition to identical investment objectives and substantially similar principal investment strategies and risks, as well as total annual fund operating expenses that are expected to be no higher (after waivers), the advisory services that are provided to the Replacement Fund by its investment adviser are comparable to the types of advisory services provided to the Replaced Fund by its investment adviser. The investment advisory fee paid to PIMCO by the Replacement Fund (0.75%) is slightly lower than the investment advisory fee paid to Franklin Mutual Advisers by the Replaced Fund (0.80%).
6. The Contracts contain features that provide adequate protection to contract owners in the event of a substitution. Moreover, the Substitution will be subject to the following: (1) A contract owner may request that his or her contract value be reallocated to another Investment Option, subject to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under their Contract, at any time during the Free Transfer Period without charge. The Free Transfer Period provides sufficient time for contract owners to reconsider their Investment Options; (2) the Substitution will be at the net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any transfer, brokerage or similar charge; (3) neither the contract owners, the Replaced Fund, nor the Replacement Fund will bear any costs of the Substitution, and all legal, accounting, and transactional costs and any brokerage or other costs incurred in the Substitution will be paid by the Insurance Company Applicants or PIMCO, and accordingly, the Substitution will have no impact on the contract owners' contract values; (4) the Substitution will in no way alter the contractual obligations of the Insurance Company Applicants or the rights and privileges of contract owners under the Contracts; and (5) the Substitution will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners.
7. The Applicants, on the basis of the facts and circumstances described above and in the application, have determined that it is in the best interests of contract owners to substitute shares of the Replaced Fund with shares of the Replacement Fund.
8. Applicants submit that the Substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
Section 17(b) Relief
1. The Section 17 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit Allianz Life and Allianz NY to carry out the Substitution by redeeming shares of the Replaced Fund in kind and using such proceeds to purchase shares of the Replacement Fund.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, acting as principal, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits any of the persons described above, acting as principal, from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company.
3. Applicants may be considered affiliates of the Replacement Fund based upon the definition of “affiliated person” in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Shares of the Replacement Fund are held by the Separate Accounts. Because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company, Allianz Life and Allianz NY and their affiliates collectively own of record shares of the Replacement Fund. Further, PIMCO, which is an affiliated person of the Replacement Fund by virtue of Section 2(a)(3)(E) of the 1940 Act, is, like Allianz Life and Allianz NY, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz SE. For these reasons, the Replacement Fund is arguably under the control of Allianz Life and Allianz NY notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the Separate Accounts. If the Replacement Fund is under the control of Allianz Life and Allianz NY, then each of Allianz Life and Allianz NY, or any person controlling Allianz Life and Allianz NY, or any person under common control with Allianz Life and Allianz NY, is an affiliated person of the Replacement Fund. Similarly, if the Replacement Fund is under the control of Allianz Life and Allianz NY, then the Replacement Fund is an affiliated person of Allianz Life and Allianz NY, and of any persons that control Allianz Life and Allianz NY or are under Start Printed Page 35255common control with Allianz Life and Allianz NY.
4. At the close of business on the Substitution Date, the Insurance Company Applicants will redeem shares of the Replaced Fund either in-kind or in cash, or a combination thereof, and use the proceeds of such redemptions to purchase shares of the Replacement Fund, with each subaccount of the applicable Separate Account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the Replaced Fund in the Replacement Fund. Thus, the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Replaced Fund to Allianz Life and Allianz NY. Immediately thereafter, Allianz Life and Allianz NY would purchase shares of the Replacement Fund with the portfolio securities and/or cash received from the Replaced Fund. This aspect of the Substitution may be deemed to involve one or more sales by Allianz Life or Allianz NY of securities or other property to the Replacement Fund, and could therefore be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a) of the l940 Act. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants seek relief from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act for the in-kind purchases and sales of the Replacement Fund shares.[2] 

5. Any in-kind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the Substitution will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and strategies of the Replaced Fund and the Replacement Fund. PIMCO will review the securities holdings of the Replaced Fund and determine which of the Replaced Fund's portfolio holdings would be suitable investments for the Replacement Fund in the overall context of the Replacement Fund's investment objective and strategies and consistent with PIMCO's management of the Replacement Fund. PIMCO will accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for the Replacement Fund in a cash transaction. The Section 17 Applicants submit that these portfolio securities will be of the type and quality that the Replacement Fund would have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash.
6. The Section 17 Applicants state that any securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Fund to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued based on valuation procedures adopted by the board of the PIMCO EqS VIT. The redeeming and purchasing values will be the same. Consistent with Rule 17a-7(d) under the 1940 Act, no brokerage commissions, fees, or other remuneration will be paid by the Replaced Fund or the Replacement Fund in connection with the in-kind transactions. If PIMCO declines to accept particular portfolio securities of the Replaced Fund for purchase in-kind of shares of the Replacement Fund, those positions will be liquidated by the Replaced Fund and shares of the Replacement Fund will be purchased with cash.
7. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) of the l940 Act if the evidence establishes that: (1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records found under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the Substitution, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The use of in-kind transactions will not cause contract owner interests to be diluted. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Separate Accounts. The proposed transactions cannot be effected at a price that is disadvantageous to either the Replaced Fund or the Replacement Fund. Contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the Substitution. Fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitution. Even though they may not rely on Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The board of the PIMCO EqS VIT has adopted procedures, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to which the Replacement Fund may purchase and sell securities to and from its affiliates. The Section 17 Applicants will carry out the proposed in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 under the Act and the Replacement Fund's policies and procedures relating to Rule 17a-7 under the Act, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the proposed Substitution will be such as to offer to the Replacement Fund the same degree of protection from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 under the Act provides to the Replacement Fund generally in connection with its purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, Allianz Life and Allianz NY (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to the Replacement Fund. Although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based upon (1) The independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7 under the Act, and (2) the net asset value per share of each Fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions. The board of the PIMCO EqS VIT will conduct its review of the transactions in the same manner that it normally would follow in accordance with Rule 17a-7 under the l940 Act.
10. The proposed transactions also are reasonable and fair in that they will be effected in a manner consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Contract owners will be fully informed of the terms of the Substitution and they will be provided a prospectus for the Replacement Fund. In addition, contract owners will have the opportunity to make a free transfer from the Replacement Fund to any other available Investment Option offered under their Contract, subject to any Investment Option allocation Start Printed Page 35256restrictions under their Contract, during the Free Transfer Period.
11. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the Substitution is consistent with the policies of the Replaced Fund and the Replacement Fund as recited in the current registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act.
12. In addition, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. Securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds from the Replaced Fund and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Fund to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued in accordance with the requirements of Rule 17a-7 under the l940 Act. Therefore, there will be no change in value to any contract owner as a result of the Substitution.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above and in the application, the Applicants and the Section 17 Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) of the Act and Section 17(b) of the Act, respectively, and should therefore, be granted.

B) which were combined into one prospectus and SAI on May 1, 2002. The only     
difference between the prospectuses was the underlying funding options. The only
difference between the statements of additional information was the performance 
figures shown for the different underlying funding options.                     

As of December 31, 2003  disclosure  relating to the Valuemark IV Prospectus and
SAI (previously  Version A) was removed from the combined prospectus and SAI and
will no longer be updated  for those  contract  owners  since the  Valuemark  IV
Contract  is no  longer  offered  for new  sales.  In the event  that  sales are
re-commenced, the Registrant will file an amended Registration Statement for the
Contract.

The Bylaws of the Insurance Company provide:                                    
ARTICLE XI. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES        
Section 1. RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION:                            
  (a)Subject to the conditions of this Article and any conditions or
  limitations imposed by applicable law, the Corporation shall
        indemnify any employee, director or officer of the Corporation (an
      "Indemnified Person") who was, is, or in the sole opinion of the
         Corporation, may reasonably become a party to or otherwise involved
          in any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Person
is or was:                                                
(i) a director of the Corporation; or                     
    (ii) acting in the course and scope of his or her duties as an
officer or employee of the Corporation; or (iii) rendering
        Professional Services at the request of and for the benefit of the
          Corporation; or (iv) serving at the request of the Corporation as an
    officer, director, fiduciary or member of another corporation,
         association, committee, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
   benefit plan or other enterprise (an "Outside Organization").
        (b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, no officer, director or employee shall
 be indemnified pursuant to these bylaws under the following
          circumstances: (i) in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such
         person, in his or her own personal capacity, unless such initiation
  was authorized by the Board of Directors; (ii) if a court of
        competent jurisdiction finally determines that any indemnification
  hereunder is unlawful; (iii) for acts or omissions involving
           intentional misconduct or knowing and culpable violation of law; (iv)
      for acts or omissions that the Indemnified Person believes to be
           contrary to the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders
  or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the
           Indemnified Person; (v) for any transaction for which the Indemnified
   Person derived an improper personal benefit; (vi) for acts or
           omissions that show a reckless disregard for the Indemnified Person's
           duty to the Corporation or its shareholders in circumstances in which
        the Indemnified Person was aware or should have been aware, in the
           ordinary course of performing the Indemnified Person's duties, of the
          risk of serious injury to the Corporation or its shareholders; (vii)
   for acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of
           inattention that amounts to an abdication of the Indemnified Person's
duties to the Corporation or its shareholders; (viii) in  
          circumstances where indemnification is prohibited by applicable law;
       (ix) in the case of service as an officer, director, fiduciary or
         member of an Outside Organization, where the Indemnified Person was
      aware or should have been aware that the conduct in question was
outside the scope of the assignment as contemplated by the
Corporation.                                              
Section 2. SCOPE OF INDEMNIFICATION:                            
 (a)Indemnification provided pursuant to Section 1(a)(iv) shall be
           secondary and subordinate to indemnification or insurance provided to
          an Indemnified Person by an Outside Organization or other source, if
any.                                                      
        (b)Indemnification shall apply to all reasonable expenses, liability and
       losses, actually incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Person in
 connection with a Proceeding, including without limitation,
 attorneys' fees and any expenses of establishing a right to
          indemnification or advancement under this article, judgments, fines,
    ERISA excise taxes or penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in
        settlement and all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
         payable in connection with or in respect of such expense, liability
and loss.                                                 
       (c)Such indemnification shall continue as to any Indemnified Person who
          has ceased to be an employee, director or officer of the Corporation
           and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, estate, executors
and administrators.                                       
Section 3. DEFINITIONS:                                         
      (a)"Corporation" for the purpose of Article XI shall mean Allianz Life
Insurance Company of New York and all of its subsidiaries.
        (b)"Proceeding" shall mean any threatened, pending, or completed action,
 suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative,
         investigative or otherwise, including actions by or in the right of
the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor.       
       (c)"Professional Services" shall mean services rendered pursuant to (i)
           a professional actuarial designation, (ii) a license to engage in the
  practice of law issued by a State Bar Institution or (iii) a
    Certified Public Accountant designation issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.                

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 may be permitted for directors and officers or controlling persons of the  
Insurance Company pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, the Insurance Company
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission  
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and,      
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the Insurance Company of expenses   
incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Insurance  
Company in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the          
securities being registered, the Company will, unless in the opinion of its     
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court 
of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is  
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final 
adjudication of such issue.

The names of the following Investment Options are changed to the new names listed below: New Name MFS VIT Total Return Bond Portfolio PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio Previous Name MFS VIT Research Bond Portfolio PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Portfolio PRO Page 1 of 24 The Investment Objective for the PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, is replaced as follows: Seeks to provide current income that exceeds the average yield on global stocks, with a secondary objective to provide long-term capital appreciation. The Primary Investments for the PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, is replaced as follows: Normally invests at least 75% of its assets in equity securities, including common and preferred stock, of issuers that PIMCO believes are attractively valued that currently pay dividends and have the potential for earnings and dividend growth over time. May invest a significant portion of its assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign countries. 3. AZL Money Market Fund In July 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted certain amendments to the regulations governing money market mutual funds, which will change significantly the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate. At its meeting on June 16, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Trust considered the likely effects of the rule changes on the AZL Money Market Fund and approved changes proposed by the Fund s Manager, Allianz Investment Management LLC, to the name and principal investment strategies of the Fund. As a result of these changes, the Fund will become a government money market fund and will be called the AZL Government Money Market Fund. As a government money market fund, the Fund will be permitted, subject to the revised regulations, to continue to use a stable net asset value ($1.00), and the Fund will not be required to impose fees on shareholder redemptions or to temporarily suspend redemptions in the event that the Fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold. The Board believes that this result is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The changes to the Fund are expected to be fully implemented by May 1, 2016, prior to the final compliance dates for the new rules; however, it is anticipated that the Fund s subadviser, BlackRock Advisors, LLC, will begin immediately to gradually implement changes to the Fund s portfolio in order to provide the most efficient transition. As a result, it is expected that the Fund gradually will allocate a larger percentage of its assets to government securities over time until it reaches its new allocation on or about May 1, Because the yields on government securities generally may be expected to be lower than the yields on comparable non-government securities, it should be expected that the Fund s yield will decrease as more assets are invested in government securities. As a result of these changes approved by the Board of Trustees, the Fund is no longer subject to the requirement that it invest at least 25% of its assets in the financial services industry. Effective on or about May 1, 2016, the name of the Fund will be changed to AZL Government Money Market Fund and the Primary Investments, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus is expected to be updated to the following: Invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully. Investments include U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations. In addition, the Fund may invest in variable and floating rate instruments. 4.

PRO (VSN-159)9 ALLIANZ VISION SM VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT issued on or prior to April 26, 2013 Issued by Allianz Life Variable Account B and Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life, we, us, our) This prospectus describes an individual flexible purchase payment variable deferred annuity contract (Contract) issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life, we, us, our). The Base Contract offers you, the Owner, standard features including: multiple variable investment options (Investment Options) and annuitization options (Annuity Options), a free withdrawal privilege, a seven-year withdrawal charge period, and a death benefit (Traditional Death Benefit). The Contract offers optional benefits for an additional charge: Bonus Option provides a 6% bonus on the money you put into the Contract (Purchase Payments) subject to a vesting schedule. Bonus annuity contracts generally have higher charges than contracts without a bonus and therefore, the charges may be greater than the bonus. Quarterly Value Death Benefit locks in any quarterly investment gains (Quarterly Anniversary Value) to potentially provide an increased death benefit. Income Focus provides guaranteed lifetime income (Income Focus Payments, which are similar to Lifetime Plus Payments) until annuitization. We base payments on a percentage of adjusted Purchase Payments, and that percentage can potentially increase by 1% each year if your Contract Value increases. Income Focus was available from April 29, 2013 through April 24, 2015 and is described in Appendix I. Income Protector provides guaranteed lifetime income (Lifetime Plus Payments) until annuitization. We base payments on a value (Benefit Base) that is at least equal to total Purchase Payments adjusted for withdrawals plus a quarterly simple interest increase (Annual Increase). Income Protector allows access to your investment value (Contract Value) and death benefit for a period of time after payments begin. Payments can begin once the minimum exercise age is met, or as late as age 90. If you are required to annuitize your Contract as a result of current tax law, which may occur at age 95 or later, we provide an annuity option with payments at least equal to the Lifetime Plus Payments you are then receiving as described in section 9, The Annuity Phase When Annuity Payments Begin. Investment Protector provides a level of protection for your principal and any annual investment gains (Target Value), on a future date if you hold the Contract for the required period. If you have the Quarterly Value Death Benefit, you must also have either Income Protector, Investment Protector, or one of the previously available Lifetime Benefits or Target Date Benefits (an Additional Required Benefit). However, you can have an Additional Required Benefit separately without having the Quarterly Value Death Benefit. If you select Income Protector or Investment Protector, we restrict your Investment Option selection and allocations and rebalance your Contract Value quarterly. Withdrawals reduce the guaranteed values provided by the Quarterly Value Death Benefit, Income Protector and Investment Protector, and may cause these benefits to end prematurely. For optional benefit availability, see section 11, Selection of Optional Benefits and check with your Financial Professional, the person who provided you advice regarding this Contract. For information on the rates used to calculate the guaranteed values and benefits for the Income Protector and Investment Protector riders, please see the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. Please see Appendix J of this prospectus for information regarding the rates for previously available Income Protector and Investment Protector riders issued before April 27, All guarantees under the Contract are the obligations of Allianz Life and are subject to the claims paying ability of Allianz Life.

However, there are some technical words or terms that are capitalized and are used as defined terms throughout the prospectus. For your convenience, we included this glossary to define these terms. 5% Annual Increase an amount used to determine the Benefit Base under the Lifetime Plus Benefit described in Appendix D. 10% Annual Increase an amount used to determine the Benefit Base under the Lifetime Plus 10 Benefit described in Appendix D. Accumulation Phase the initial phase of your Contract before you apply your total Contract Value to Annuity Payments. The Accumulation Phase begins on the Issue Date and may occur at the same time as the Annuity Phase if you take Partial Annuitizations. Additional Required Benefit an additional optional benefit you must have if you chose either the No Withdrawal Charge Option described in Appendix H, or the Quarterly Value Death Benefit described in section 11.c. Additional Required Benefits include Income Protector, Investment Protector, and the previously available Lifetime Benefits, Target Date Benefits, and Income Focus. Annual Increase an amount used to determine the Benefit Base under Income Protector before Lifetime Plus Payments begin as discussed in section 11.a. If selected at issue, it is equal to total Purchase Payments adjusted for withdrawals plus a quarterly simple interest increase. We then reset this value to equal the current Contract Value if greater, and apply future quarterly simple interest to this reset value. Annual Increase Percentage the simple interest increase we apply quarterly to the Annual Increase as discussed in section 11.a. The Annual Increase Percentage for the Income Protector rider is stated in the Income Protector Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement that you receive at the time you select the benefit and that is in effect on your Rider Effective Date. Please see Appendix J for the Annual Increase Percentage for previously available Income Protector riders issued before April 27, Annuitant the individual upon whose life we base the Annuity Payments. Subject to our approval, the Owner designates the Annuitant, and can add a joint Annuitant for the Annuity Phase if they take a Full Annuitization. There are restrictions on who can become an Annuitant. Annuity Options the annuity income options available to you under the Contract. Annuity Payments payments made by us to the Payee pursuant to the chosen Annuity Option. Annuity Phase the phase the Contract is in once Annuity Payments begin. This may occur at the same time as the Accumulation Phase if you apply part of your Contract Value to a Partial Annuitization. Base Contract the Contract without any optional benefits. Beneficiary unless otherwise required by the Contract, the person(s) or entity the Owner designates to receive any death benefit. Benefit Anniversary a twelve-month anniversary of the Benefit Date, or any subsequent twelve-month Benefit Anniversary. Benefit Base the amount we use to determine the initial annual maximum Lifetime Plus Payment. Benefit Date the date you begin receiving Lifetime Plus Payments under Income Protector as discussed in section 11.a or under the Lifetime Benefits discussed in Appendix D, or Income Focus Payments under Income Focus. Benefit Year any period of twelve months beginning on the Benefit Date, or on a subsequent Benefit Anniversary. Bonus Option an optional benefit that provides a 6% bonus on Purchase Payments we receive before the older Owner reaches age 81 (subject to a three-year vesting schedule) as discussed in section 11.d. This benefit has an additional M&E charge and a higher and longer withdrawal charge schedule. Bonus Value if you have the Bonus Option, the total Contract Value plus any unvested bonus amounts. 615 Business Day each day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, except when an Investment Option does not value its shares. Allianz Life is open for business on each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open. Our Business Day closes when regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange closes, which is usually at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Charge Lock Date this is the date after which your Income Protector or Income Focus rider charge does not change. Charge Lock Option a rider that may be available to you if you have Income Protector or Income Focus and we increase your benefit s rider charge. The Charge Lock Option rider allows you to keep your benefit at the current rider charge, but with reduced guaranteed values and payments, and no opportunity for future payment increases. The Charge Lock Option rider for Income Protector is discussed in section 11.a, and for Income Focus it is discussed in Appendix I. Contract the individual flexible purchase payment variable deferred annuity contract described by this prospectus. Contract Anniversary a twelve-month anniversary of the Issue Date or any subsequent twelve-month Contract Anniversary. Contract Value on any Business Day, the sum of the values in your selected Investment Options. The Contract Value reflects the deduction of any contract maintenance charge, transfer fee, M&E charge and rider charge, but does not reflect the deduction of any withdrawal charge. It does not include amounts applied to a Partial Annuitization. If you have the Bonus Option, Contract Value includes only vested bonus amounts; it does not include unvested bonus amounts. Contract Year any period of twelve months beginning on the Issue Date or a subsequent Contract Anniversary. Covered Person(s) the person(s) upon whose age and lifetime(s) we base Lifetime Plus Payments or Income Focus Payments. There are restrictions on who can become a Covered Person. Cumulative Withdrawal while you are receiving Lifetime Plus Payments under the Lifetime Benefits described in Appendix D, this is the portion of a withdrawal that is less than or equal to your Cumulative Withdrawal Value. Cumulative Withdrawal Benefit a benefit under the Lifetime Benefits described in Appendix D in all states except Nevada that allows you to control the amount of Lifetime Plus Payments you receive. Cumulative Withdrawal Value under the Lifetime Benefits described in Appendix D, if you take less than the maximum Lifetime Plus Payment that you are entitled to, we add the difference between the annual maximum and annual actual Lifetime Plus Payment to the Cumulative Withdrawal Value. Earliest Anniversary the earliest available initial Target Value Date that you can select as discussed in section 11.b. In the Contract the Earliest Anniversary is called the Earliest Target Value Anniversary. The Earliest Anniversary for the Investment Protector rider is stated in the Investment Protector Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement that you receive at the time you select the benefit and that is in effect on your Rider Effective Date. Please see Appendix J for the Earliest Anniversary for previously available Investment Protector riders issued before April 27, Enhanced 5% Annual Increase an amount used to determine the Benefit Base under the Lifetime Plus II Benefit described in Appendix D. Enhanced 10-Year Value an amount used to determine the Benefit Base under the Lifetime Plus Benefit or Lifetime Plus II Benefit described in Appendix D. Excess Withdrawal if you select Income Protector or have Income Focus, the amount of any withdrawal you take while you are receiving Lifetime Plus Payments or Income Focus Payments that, when added to other withdrawals taken during the Benefit Year, is greater than your annual maximum permitted payment. Excess Withdrawals reduce your Contract Value and any guaranteed values, and may end your Contract. If you have one of the Lifetime Benefits, please see Appendix D for a definition of Excess Withdrawal that applies to your Contract. Financial Professional the person who advises you regarding the Contract. Full Annuitization the application of the total Contract Value to Annuity Payments. Future Anniversary the number of Rider Anniversaries that occur between the initial Target Value Date and each subsequent Target Value Date as discussed in section 11.b.

Income Protector provides no payment until the younger Covered Person meets the minimum exercise age stated in the Income Protector Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement for the Income Protector rider, or stated in Appendix J for the previously available Income Protector riders issued before April 27, Income Value(s) if you have Income Focus, we establish an Income Value for all Purchase Payments received in a specific time period that have the same associated Income Value Percentage as stated in Appendix I. We adjust each Income Value for subsequent withdrawals. A single Contract may have multiple Income Values. We use Income Value(s) to calculate the annual maximum Income Focus Payment.

We establish a separate Income Value Percentage for each Income Value as discussed in Appendix I. Each Income Value Percentage can potentially increase by 1% each year if your Contract Value increases. Increase Base an amount we use to determine the Annual Increase as discussed in section 11.a. If you selected Income Protector at issue, it is initially equal to total Purchase Payments adjusted for withdrawals.

Please see Appendix J for the Payment Percentages table for previously available Income Protector riders issued before April 27, Performance Increase a 1% annual increase to each Income Value Percentage if your annual Contract Value increases. A Performance Increase occurs for an Income Value Percentage only if it is associated with an Income Value we have had for at least one full Rider Year. Purchase Payment the money you put into the Contract. Qualified Contract a Contract purchased under a pension or retirement plan qualified for special tax treatment under sections of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, 401(a) and 401(k) plans), Individual Retirement Annuities (IRAs), or Tax-Sheltered Annuities (referred to as TSA or 403(b) contracts).

Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplements the supplements that must accompany this prospectus that contain the rates for the values used to calculate the benefits provided by the Income Protector and Investment Protector riders that you receive at the time your select the benefit and that is in effect on your Rider Effective Date. The Income Protector Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement has the values for the Annual Increase Percentage, Guarantee Years and Payment Percentages table. The Investment Protector Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement has the values for the Guarantee Percentage, Earliest Anniversary and Future Anniversary. Once these rates are established for your Contract, they will not change while your benefit is in effect. 918 Rider Anniversary a twelve-month anniversary of the Rider Effective Date or any subsequent twelve-month Rider Anniversary.

divide the applicable Contract Value, transferring part to one Investment Option
and part to other Investment Options, subject to any Contract limitations on    
minimum investment in a particular Investment Option. Your free transfer will   
not count as one of the limited number of transfers permitted in a year free of 
charge, and Allianz Life Insurance Company will not impose any additional       
transfer restrictions on this transfer. If you have already exercised your free 
transfer, any transfer you make will count toward any limitations on free       
transfers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 (202-551-8090).  Start Printed Page 51537

Applicants' Representations  
1. Allianz Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota. Allianz NY is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of New York.  
2. Allianz Account A is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-04965) and is used to fund certain variable life insurance policies issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account A is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific underlying registered investment company or portfolio thereof (each an “Investment Option”). Three variable life insurance contracts funded by Allianz Account A are affected by this application.  
Allianz Account B is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-05618) and is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account B is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific Investment Option. Fourteen variable annuity contracts funded by Allianz Account B are affected by this application.  
Allianz Account C is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-05716) and is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Allianz NY. Allianz Account C is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific Investment Option. Six variable annuity contracts funded by Allianz Account C are affected by this application.  
3. For purposes of the 1940 Act, Allianz Life is the depositor and sponsor of Allianz Account A and Allianz Account B, and Allianz NY is the depositor and sponsor of Allianz Account C, as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts. Each Separate Account meets the definition of a “separate account” in Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act.    
4. The Contracts allow contractowners to allocate premium payments and transfer Contract value among the various subaccounts of the Separate Accounts. Of the 12 Contracts with effective and updated registration statements, eight offer all 78 Investment Options that are available under the Separate Accounts, two offer 74 Investment Options, one offers 73 Investment Options, and one offers 64 Investment Options. Two of these Contracts (known as Allianz Alterity and Allianz Rewards) have restrictions on the allocations that contractowners may make to the Investment Options if they select the optional Prime Plus Benefit. Under these Contracts, when certain risk or volatility limits are exceeded, allocations and transfers to certain Investment Options, including each of the Replaced Funds (as defined below), are limited or prohibited. The limits on allocations and transfers to the Replacement Funds (as defined below) under the Prime Plus Benefits are, and will be, no more restrictive than on the associated Replaced Funds.  
In most instances, up to 12 transfers may be made during each year free of charge (the year is measured by the date of issuance of the Contract). Under these Contracts, Insurance Company Applicants have reserved the right to charge a $25 fee (or the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount transferred for certain Contracts) for each transfer in excess of 12 per Contract year. Since the Contracts are not designed for professional market timing organizations, or other persons using programmed, large, or frequent transfers, Insurance Company Applicants have reserved the right to restrict transfer activity that they determine to be excessive or inappropriate.  
5. Under the Contracts, Insurance Company Applicants reserve the right, subject to regulatory approval, to substitute one of the Investment Options with another Investment Option after appropriate notice. Moreover, the Contracts permit Insurance Company Applicants to limit allocation of purchase payments to one or more subaccounts that invest in an Investment Option. The prospectuses or statements of additional information for the Contracts also contain appropriate disclosure of these rights. Thus, subject to regulatory approval, the Contracts permit Insurance Company Applicants to stop accepting purchase payments into one or more Investment Options and/or to substitute the shares representing an Investment Option held in a subaccount for the shares representing another Investment Option.  
6. The Contracts are variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. Allianz Life currently issues individual deferred variable annuity contracts and has previously issued immediate variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. Allianz NY issues individual deferred variable annuity contracts offered for sale in New York.  
7. Currently, Allianz Life has the following registration statements which are effective and updated with the Commission for Contracts sponsored by Allianz Account B that offer the Replaced Funds as Investment Options:

11. Applicants propose to substitute certain classes of shares of the AZL Jennison 20/20 Focus Fund, AZL S&P 500 Index Fund, and AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund (each a “Replacement Fund” and collectively the “Replacement Funds”) for certain classes of shares of the corresponding funds listed in the table below (each a “Replaced Fund” and collectively the “Replaced Funds”) currently held by the Separate Accounts.

12. Each Replacement Fund is a series of the VIP Trust, a Delaware business trust. The VIP Trust is registered as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-9491) and its shares are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”) (File No. 333-83423).  
13. Each of the Replacement Funds, as well as all other funds offered by the VIP Trust, is managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC (“AZIM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz Life. AZIM is registered as an investment adviser with the Commission pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (File No. 801-60167).  
14. The AZL Jennison 20/20 Focus Fund is assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan. Class 1 shares of the AZL S&P 500 Index Fund are not assessed a 12b-1 fee, while Class 2 shares of the AZL S&P 500 Index Fund are assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets attributable to Class 2 shares, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan. The AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund is assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan.  
15. Under the terms of a “manager of managers” exemptive order issued by the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 25734 (September 17, 2002), AZIM selects and manages subadvisers for the various series of the VIP Trust, subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of the VIP Trust, without obtaining shareholder approval (the “Manager of Managers Order”). The relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to all of the Replacement Funds. The Replacement Funds are offered to contractowners via prospectuses containing disclosure (1) describing the existence, substance, and effect of the Manager of Managers Order; (2) holding the Replacement Funds out to the public as employing the management structure described in the application for the Manager of Managers Order; and (3) explaining that AZIM has the ultimate responsibility (subject to oversight by the Board of Trustees of the Start Printed Page 51539VIP Trust) to oversee the subadvisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement. The Replacement Funds' prospectuses will be provided to each affected contractowner prior to the Substitutions.  
16. The Dreyfus Investment Portfolios Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio  (“Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio”) is a series of Dreyfus Investment Portfolios (“Dreyfus IP”). Service shares of the Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio are assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan.  
Initial shares of the Dreyfus Stock Index Fund, Inc. are not assessed a 12b-1 fee, while Service shares of the Dreyfus Stock Index Fund, Inc. are assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets attributable to Service shares, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan.

22. The following chart compares the management fees and the total operating expenses (before and after any waivers and reimbursements) for the year ended December 31, 2007, expressed as an annual percentage of average daily net assets, of the Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio and the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund. As noted below, an expense cap will be in place for the AZL Small Cap Stock Index for two years from the date of the Substitution so that the Net Total Operating Expenses for the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund are expected to be no greater than for the Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio.

23. As a result of the Substitutions, the number of Investment Options under each Contract will either not be decreased, or, in those cases where the number of Investment Options is being reduced, continue to offer a significant number of alternative Investment Options. Specifically, the number of Investment Options is currently expected to range in number from 29 to 75 after the Substitutions versus 29 to 78 before the Substitutions.  
24. At the close of business on the day of the Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), Insurance Company Applicants will each redeem shares of the Replaced Funds held by their Separate Accounts in kind and apply the proceeds of such redemptions to the purchase shares of the corresponding Replacement Funds. Thus, after the Substitutions, each subaccount of the Separate Accounts previously holding shares of a Replaced Fund will hold shares of the corresponding Replacement Fund.  
25. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that redemption of Replaced Fund shares and purchase of Replacement Fund shares will both occur at the price for such shares computed as of the close of business on the Substitution Date in a manner consistent with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. As a result, the full net asset value of the Replaced Fund shares held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the contractowners' Contract values following the Substitutions, without reduction for brokerage or other such fees or charges. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage Start Printed Page 51542commissions, will be paid by Insurance Company Applicants, or the manager of the Replacement Funds. Accordingly, Contract value attributable to contractowners then invested in the Replaced Funds will remain fully invested at all times, and the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contractowner's Contract value, death benefit, or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the applicable Separate Account.  
26. Affected contractowners will not incur any fees or charges in connection with the Substitutions so that the net asset value of redeemed shares of the Replaced Funds held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the contractowners' Contract values following the Substitutions. Moreover, neither the obligations of the respective Insurance Company Applicants under the Contracts nor the rights of contractowners will be altered in any way by the Substitutions. The Substitutions will not impose any tax liability or have any adverse tax consequences on contractowners. The Substitutions will not cause Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners of Contracts to be greater after the Substitutions than they were before the Substitutions. For a period of at least 30 days following the Substitutions, Insurance Company Applicants will not exercise any right it may have under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers except pursuant to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under the Contracts.6  
27. From the date that notice of the Substitutions was provided to affected contractowners by means of a prospectus supplement (the “Pre-Substitution Supplement”) through the date 30 days after the Substitution (the “Free Transfer Period”), the respective Insurance Company Applicants will allow the affected contractowners to make one transfer of Contract value held in each subaccount investing in the Replaced Funds (before the Substitutions) or Replacement Fund (after the Substitutions) to one or more Investment Options available pursuant to the Contracts without charge and without assessing transfer fees. Such a transfer also will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the Contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge.  
28. Under the Manager of Managers Order, subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees of the VIP Trust, AZIM may retain one or more subadvisers for any fund of the VIP Trust without the approval of shareholders of the fund. However, after the Substitution Date, Insurance Company Applicants represent that AZIM will not retain any new subadviser for the AZL S&P 500 Index Fund and the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order in connection with AZL S&P 500 Index Fund and the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund, without first obtaining shareholder approval of either: (1) the new subadviser, or (2) the fund's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order.  
29. Notice of the Substitutions and Free Transfer Period has been given to all affected contractowners by means of the Pre-Substitution Supplement for each of the Contracts stating that Applicants have filed the application and seek approval of the Substitutions. The Pre-Substitution Supplement sets forth the anticipated Substitution Date and advises affected contractowners that Contract values allocated to subaccounts investing in shares of the Replaced Funds will be transferred to subaccounts investing in shares of the Replacement Funds, without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge, on the Substitution Date. The Pre-Substitution Supplement states that, during the Free Transfer Period, affected contractowners may make one transfer of Contract value from each subaccount investing in a Replaced Fund (before the Substitutions) or a Replacement Fund (after the Substitutions) to one or more other subaccount(s), subject to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under their Contract, without charge and without the transfer counting against any limitations on transfers. Further, prior to the Substitutions, all affected contractowners will receive a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Funds.  
30. Within five days following the Substitutions, Insurance Company Applicants will send a written notice to affected contractowners stating that the Substitutions were carried out and reiterating the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Supplement.  
31. For those who were contractowners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, Insurance Company Applicants will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the 24 months following the Substitution Date, those contractowners whose subaccount invests in any Replacement Fund such that the sum of such Replacement Fund's (a) operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements), net of any acquired fund fees and expenses, and (b) asset-based fees and charges for the Contracts for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the corresponding Replaced Fund's operating expenses (taking into account any fee waiver or expense reimbursement) and subaccount expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Thereafter, expenses for the Replacement Funds will vary from year to year and may exceed those of the corresponding Replaced Funds.  
Applicants' Legal Analysis  
1. Applicants represent that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. Applicants note that the Commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.    
2. Applicants note the legislative history makes clear that Congress intended Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act to provide the Commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions that could otherwise, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial purchase payments, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both.  
3. Applicants assert that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act would not appear to have been designed to prohibit transactions like the Substitutions, in which a number of customer protections are provided, including the fact that the applicable unit investment trusts (the Separate Accounts) offer in excess of 63 different Investment Options.  
4. Applicants claim that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitutions are consistent with the principles and purposes of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act is designed to prevent. Contractowners will not be assessed charges in connection with the Substitutions and their annual fund net total operating expenses are expected to remain the same or decrease. In addition, to the extent a contractowner does not wish to participate in the Start Printed Page 51543Substitutions, he or she is free to make one transfer to any other option available under the relevant Contract at any time prior to the date of the Substitutions or during the 30-day period following the date of the Substitutions without any transfer fee and without that transfer counting as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the Contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge. Moreover, the Contracts have features that Applicants believe provide adequate protection to contractowners. These features include:  
(1) A significant number of different Investment Options;  
(2) Investment Options that are reasonably diversified;  
(3) Investment Options that are reasonably seasoned;  
(4) Reasonable transferability between Investment Options;  
(5) Investment choices that include an option that is intended to reduce or eliminate fluctuation of principal; and  
(6) Reasonable liquidity in the form of free partial withdrawal rights.  
5. In addition, contractowners will be substituted into Replacement Funds whose investment objectives, principal investment policies, and risks Applicants believe will be substantially similar or virtually identical to those of the corresponding Replaced Funds, with net total operating expenses that are anticipated to be equal to or less than those of their corresponding Replaced Funds. Like the Replaced Funds which are not assessed a 12b-1 fee, their corresponding Replacement Funds will not be assessed a 12b-1 fee.  
6. In addition to substantially similar or virtually identical investment objectives, principal investment policies, and risks, as well as anticipated equal or lower net total operating expenses, Applicants maintain that the types of investment advisory and administrative services that will be provided to the Replacement Funds by their subadvisers will be comparable to the types of investment advisory and administrative services currently provided to the Replaced Funds by their respective investment advisers. Contractowners who become beneficial owners of the Replacement Funds as a result of the proposed Substitutions will enjoy continuity of their asset manager. These Replacement Funds will be managed by AZIM, but the asset management activity will be handled by the subadviser that currently manages the corresponding Replaced Fund.  
7. Moreover, because the Replacement Funds operate pursuant to the Manager of Managers Order, Applicants believe that the proposed Substitutions will provide protection to contractowners by giving AZIM the flexibility to change the subadvisers of the Replacement Funds should such a change become warranted or advisable. Thus, Applicants will provide contractowners with investment vehicles following the Substitutions that will be substantially similar to those offered prior to the Substitutions.  
8. In further support of their contention that the Substitutions do not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act was intended to guard against and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act, Applicants note that the Substitutions will be subject to the following terms and conditions:  
(1) A contractowner may request that his or her Contract value be reallocated to another Investment Option, subject to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under their Contract, at any time during the Free Transfer Period without charge. The Free Transfer Period provides sufficient time for contractowners to reconsider their Investment Options;  
(2) The Substitutions will be at net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any transfer, brokerage or similar charge;  
(3) Neither the contractowners, the Replaced Funds, nor the Replacement Funds will bear any costs of the Substitutions, and all legal, accounting, and transactional costs and any brokerage or other costs incurred in the Substitutions will be paid by Insurance Company Applicants or the managers to the Replacement Funds, and accordingly, the Substitutions will have no impact on the contractowners' Contract values;    
(4) The Substitutions will in no way alter the contractual obligations of Insurance Company Applicants or the rights and privileges of contractowners under the Contracts; and  
(5) The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax benefits to contractowners.  
9. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c)  of the 1940 Act approving the Substitutions on the terms set forth in this Application. Applicants believe, for all of the reasons stated above, that each Substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.  
10. Section 17 Applicants also request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b)  of the 1940 Act exempting them from Section 17(a)  of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit Insurance Company Applicants to carry out the Substitutions by redeeming shares of the Replaced Funds in kind and using the proceeds to purchase shares of the Replacement Funds.  
11. Section 17(a)(1)  of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, acting as principal, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2)  of the 1940 Act prohibits any of the persons described above, acting as principal, from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company. Section 2(a)(3)  of the 1940 Act defines the term “affiliated person” of another person in relevant part as:  
(A) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, five per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person; (B) any person five per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such other person; (C) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person; (D) any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such other person; (E) if such other person is an investment company, any investment adviser thereof or any member of an advisory board thereof; and (F) if such other person is an unincorporated investment company not having a board of directors, the depositor thereof.
12. Applicants may be considered affiliates of each of the Replacement Funds based upon the definition of “affiliated person” in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Shares of the funds of the VIP Trust are held solely by Separate Accounts. Because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company, Insurance Company Applicants, and their affiliates collectively, own of record all of the shares of the funds of the VIP Trust, including the Replacement Funds. Further, AZIM, an affiliated person of the VIP Trust by virtue of Section 2(a)(3) (E) of the 1940 Act, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz Life. For these reasons, the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are arguably under the control of Insurance Company Applicants notwithstanding the fact that contractowners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the Separate Accounts. If the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are under the control of Insurance Company Applicants, then Insurance Company Applicants, or any person controlling Start Printed Page 51544Insurance Company Applicants, or any person under common control with Insurance Company Applicants, is an affiliated person of the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds. Similarly, if the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are under the control of Insurance Company Applicants, then the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are affiliated persons of Insurance Company Applicants, and of any persons that control Insurance Company Applicants or are under common control with Insurance Company Applicants.  
At the close of business on the Substitution Date, Insurance Company Applicants will redeem shares of the Replaced Funds either in kind or in cash and use the proceeds of such redemptions to purchase shares of the corresponding Replacement Funds, with each subaccount of the applicable Separate Account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the Replaced Funds in the applicable Replacement Funds. Thus, the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Replaced Funds to Insurance Company Applicants; immediately thereafter, Insurance Company Applicants would purchase shares of the Replacement Funds with the portfolio securities received from the Replaced Funds. This aspect of the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more sales by Insurance Company Applicants of securities or other property to the Replacement Funds. Accordingly, this aspect of the Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act. Accordingly, Section 17 Applicants seek relief from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act for the in-kind purchases and sales of the Replacement Fund shares.  
13. Section 17 Applicants assert that any in-kind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the Substitutions will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Replacement Funds. Subject to the oversight of AZIM, the subadvisers of each of the Replacement Funds will review the securities holdings of their corresponding Replaced Fund and determine which of the Replaced Fund holdings would be suitable investments for the corresponding Replacement Fund in the overall context of that Replacement Fund's investment objective and policies and consistent with their management of the Replacement Fund, and will accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction. Section 17 Applicants submit that these portfolio securities will be of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash.  
14. Section 17 Applicants state that any securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Funds to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued in accordance with the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios. The redeeming and purchasing values will be the same. Consistent with Rule 17a-7(d) under the 1940 Act, no brokerage commissions, fees, or other remuneration will be paid by the Replaced Funds or the Replacement Funds in connection with the in-kind transactions. If AZIM declines to accept particular portfolio securities of any of the Replaced Funds for purchase of in-kind shares of any of the Replacement Funds, those positions will be liquidated by the applicable Replaced Fund, and shares of the corresponding Replacement Fund will be purchased with cash.    
15. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act if the evidence establishes that: (1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records found under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.  
16. Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the Substitutions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The use of in-kind transactions will not cause contractowner interests to be diluted. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any contractowner's Contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Separate Accounts. Contractowners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the Substitutions. Fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though they may not rely on Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, Section 17 Applicants submit that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.  
17. The board of the VIP Trust has adopted procedures, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act (the “17a-7 Procedures”), pursuant to which the Replacement Funds may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates. Section 17 Applicants will carry out the proposed in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the 17a-7 Procedures, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the proposed Substitutions will be such as to offer to each Replacement Fund the same degree of protection from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, Insurance Company Applicants (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of each fund involved, valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions. The transactions will be reviewed by the Chief Compliance Officer of the VIP Trust, or his agents, and will be reported to the VIP Trust's Board of Trustees in the same manner as any other 17a-7 transaction by any of the Replacement Funds would be reported.  
18. Section 17 Applicants also submit that the in-kind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the policies of the Replacement Funds and the VIP Trust as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the 1940 Act.  Start Printed Page 51545

19. In addition, Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed in-kind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. Further, Section 17 Applicants note that securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Funds to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued based on the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming Replaced Funds and purchasing Replacement Funds. Therefore, there will be no change in value to any contractowner as a result of the Substitutions.  
Conclusion  
Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed Substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be granted.

The investment options referenced below may not be offered in certain annuity products listed above. See your product prospectus for investment option availability and see your Investment Option prospectus for further information regarding the following updates. 1. AZL Morgan Stanley Mid Cap Growth Fund At its meeting on June 16, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Trust considered and approved changes proposed by the Fund s Manager, Allianz Investment Management LLC, to the name and principal investment strategies of the AZL Morgan Stanley Mid Cap Growth Fund. As a result of these changes, the Fund will add a second subadviser and be re-named the AZL Multi-Manager Mid Cap Growth Fund. Accordingly, the following changes will be made, effective on or about November 23, 2015: The name of the Fund will be changed to AZL Multi-Manager Mid Cap Growth Fund The Investment Management Company and Adviser/Subadviser, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, for the above mentioned Investment Option will be updated as follows: Managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC/Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. The Primary Investments, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, for the above mentioned Investment Option will be updated as follows: Invests in a combination of two subportfolios, or strategies, with equal allocations of the assets to each strategy. The fund as a whole will normally invest at least 80% of net assets in equity securities of mid cap companies, with market capitalizations within the range of the Russell Midcap Growth Index. 2. The names of the following Investment Options are changed to the new names listed below: New Name MFS VIT Total Return Bond Portfolio PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio Previous Name MFS VIT Research Bond Portfolio PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Portfolio PRO Page 1 of 24 The Investment Objective for the PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, is replaced as follows: Seeks to provide current income that exceeds the average yield on global stocks, with a secondary objective to provide long-term capital appreciation.

May invest a significant portion of its assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign countries. 3. AZL Money Market Fund In July 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted certain amendments to the regulations governing money market mutual funds, which will change significantly the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate. At its meeting on June 16, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Trust considered the likely effects of the rule changes on the AZL Money Market Fund and approved changes proposed by the Fund s Manager, Allianz Investment Management LLC, to the name and principal investment strategies of the Fund. As a result of these changes, the Fund will become a government money market fund and will be called the AZL Government Money Market Fund. As a government money market fund, the Fund will be permitted, subject to the revised regulations, to continue to use a stable net asset value ($1.00), and the Fund will not be required to impose fees on shareholder redemptions or to temporarily suspend redemptions in the event that the Fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold. The Board believes that this result is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The changes to the Fund are expected to be fully implemented by May 1, 2016, prior to the final compliance dates for the new rules; however, it is anticipated that the Fund s subadviser, BlackRock Advisors, LLC, will begin immediately to gradually implement changes to the Fund s portfolio in order to provide the most efficient transition. As a result, it is expected that the Fund gradually will allocate a larger percentage of its assets to government securities over time until it reaches its new allocation on or about May 1, Because the yields on government securities generally may be expected to be lower than the yields on comparable non-government securities, it should be expected that the Fund s yield will decrease as more assets are invested in government securities. As a result of these changes approved by the Board of Trustees, the Fund is no longer subject to the requirement that it invest at least 25% of its assets in the financial services industry. Effective on or about May 1, 2016, the name of the Fund will be changed to AZL Government Money Market Fund and the Primary Investments, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus is expected to be updated to the following: Invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully. Investments include U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations. In addition, the Fund may invest in variable and floating rate instruments. 4.

PRO Page 2 of 25 ALLIANZ HIGH FIVE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT Issued by Allianz Life Variable Account B and Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life, we, us, our) This prospectus describes an individual flexible purchase payment variable deferred annuity contract (Contract) issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life, we, us, our). The Contract is a flexible purchase payment contract because you (the Owner) can make more than one Purchase Payment, subject to certain restrictions. The Contract is variable because the Contract Value and any variable Annuity Payments you receive increase or decrease depending on the performance of the Investment Options you select (in this prospectus, the term Investment Options refers only to the variable Investment Choices listed on the following page, and not to any fixed Investment Choices). The Contract is deferred because you do not begin receiving regular Annuity Payments immediately. All guarantees under the Contract are the obligations of Allianz Life and are subject to our claims paying ability. Please read this prospectus before investing and keep it for future reference. It contains important information about your annuity and Allianz Life that you ought to know before investing.

We have not authorized anyone to provide you with information that is different.

A Statement of Additional Information (SAI) dated the same date as this prospectus includes additional information about the annuity offered by this prospectus. The SAI is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. The SAI is filed with the SEC and is available without charge by contacting us at the telephone number or address listed at the back of this prospectus. The SAI s table of contents appears after the Privacy and Security Statement in this prospectus. The prospectus, SAI and other Contract information are also available on the EDGAR database.

An investment in this Contract is not a deposit of a bank or financial institution and is not federally insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other federal government agency. An investment in this Contract involves investment risk including the possible loss of principal. Variable annuity contracts are complex insurance and investment vehicles. Before you invest, be sure to ask your Financial Professional about the Contract s features, benefits, risks, and fees, and whether the Contract is appropriate for you based upon your financial situation and objectives. Dated: April 27, 2015 This prospectus discusses three versions of the same Contract. The Original Contract first became available on September 20, 2002 and was replaced in all states except Washington by the May 2005 Contract. The May 2005 Contract first became available on May 1, 2005 and was replaced in all states except Washington by the February 2007 Contract. The body of this prospectus is written according to the features of the February 2007 Contract. The product features and expenses of the Original Contract and the February 2007 Contract differ in certain respects (see Appendix E to this prospectus). The only difference between the May 2005 Contract and February 2007 Contract is the amount of the mortality and expense risk charge (see the Fee Tables and section 7, Expenses Mortality and Expense Risk (M&E) Charge). 16 We currently offer the Investment Options listed below. You can invest in up to 15 Investment Options at any one time. Currently, the only fixed Investment Choices we offer under our general account are the Fixed Period Accounts (FPAs). You can only allocate up to 50% of any Purchase Payment to the FPAs. However, if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees we will make transfers to and from the FPAs to support these guarantees and we may transfer more than 50% of the total Purchase Payments to the FPAs beginning on the second Contract Anniversary. One or more of the Investment Choices may not be available in your state. We may add, substitute or remove Investment Choices in the future. Contracts with the Guaranteed Account Value (GAV) Benefit are subject to systematic transfers between your selected Investment Options and the FPAs. This means that you may not always be able to fully participate in any upside potential returns available from the Investment Options and your Contract Value may potentially be less than the Contract Value you would have had without the GAV Benefit. Transfers out of the FPAs may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment that may increase or decrease your Contract Value and/or the amount of the transfer.

Separate Account Allianz Life Variable Account B is the Separate Account that issues your Contract. It is a separate investment account of Allianz Life. The Separate Account holds the assets invested in the Investment Options that underlie the Contracts. The Separate Account is divided into subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in a single Investment Option. Separate Account Value the portion of your Contract Value that is in the subaccounts of the Separate Account during the Accumulation Phase. We calculate the Separate Account Value by multiplying the Accumulation Unit value in each subaccount by the number of Accumulation Units for each subaccount and then adding those results together. Service Center the Allianz Service Center. Our Service Center address and telephone number are listed in the following section. Traditional Annuity Payments Annuity Payments we make to the Payee based on the Contract Value. True Up an amount we may pay into your Contract under the GAV Benefit. Withdrawal Charge Basis the total amount under your Contract that is subject to a withdrawal charge. 611 FEE TABLES The following tables describe the fees and expenses that you pay when owning and taking a withdrawal from the Contract. For more information, see section 7, Expenses. The first tables describe the fees and expenses that you pay if you take a withdrawal from the Contract during the Accumulation Phase or if you make transfers. CONTRACT OWNER TRANSACTION EXPENSES (1) Withdrawal Charge During the Accumulation Phase (2),(3) (as a percentage of each Purchase Payment withdrawn) Number of Complete Years Since We Received Your Purchase Payment Charge 0 8% 1 8% (4) 2 7% 3 6% 4 5% 5 4% 6 3% 7 years or more 0% Transfer Fee (5)... $25 Premium Tax (6)... 0% to 3.5% (as a percentage of each Purchase Payment) (1) Amounts withdrawn or transferred out of a FPA may be subject to an MVA. This MVA may increase or decrease your Contract Value and/or your transfer or withdrawal amount. For more information, please see section 5, Our General Account Market Value Adjustment (MVA). (2) The partial withdrawal privilege for each Contract Year is equal to 12% of your total Purchase Payments, less any previous withdrawals taken under the partial withdrawal privilege, GWB, or as a required minimum distribution payment in the same Contract Year and before any MVA. We do not deduct a withdrawal charge from amounts withdrawn under the partial withdrawal privilege, but an MVA may apply. There is no partial withdrawal privilege during the Annuity Phase. Any unused partial withdrawal privilege in one Contract Year is not added to the amount that is available in the next Contract Year. For more details and additional information on other penalty-free withdrawal options, please see the discussion of the partial withdrawal privilege and other information that appears in section 9, Access to Your Money. (3) The total amount under your Contract that is subject to a withdrawal charge is the Withdrawal Charge Basis. The Withdrawal Charge Basis is equal to the total Purchase Payments, less any Purchase Payments withdrawn (excluding any penalty-free withdrawals), less any withdrawal charges. (4) 7.5% in Alabama, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington. (5) The first twelve transfers in a Contract Year are free. We count all transfers made in the same Business Day as one transfer. The following transfers are not subject to a transfer fee and do not count against any free transfers we allow: dollar cost averaging transfers, flexible rebalancing transfers, and GAV Transfers. Currently, we deduct this fee only during the Accumulation Phase, but we reserve the right to deduct this fee during the Annuity Phase. For more information, please see section 7, Expenses Transfer Fee. (6) It is our current practice not to make deductions from the Contract Value to reimburse ourselves for premium tax that we pay, although we reserve the right to make such a deduction in the future. For more information, please see section 7, Expenses Premium Tax. 712 CONTRACT OWNER PERIODIC EXPENSES The next tables describe the fees and expenses that you pay periodically during the time that you own your Contract, not including the Investment Options fees and expenses. The Separate Account annual expenses include the mortality and expense risk (M&E) charge.

It is also possible to have a different M&E charge on different portions of the Contract at the same time if you request variable Traditional Annuity Payments under a Partial Annuitization. For more information, please see section 3, The Annuity Phase Partial Annuitization. ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS This table describes the total annual operating expenses associated with the Investment Options and shows the minimum and maximum expenses for the period ended December 31, 2014, charged by any of the Investment Options before the effect of any contractual expense reimbursement or fee waiver. We show the expenses as a percentage of an Investment Option s average daily net assets. Minimum Maximum Total annual Investment Option operating expenses* (including management fees, distribution or 12b-1 fees, and other expenses) before fee waivers and expense reimbursements 0.49% 1.71% * Some of the Investment Options or their affiliates may also pay service fees to us or our affiliates. The amount of these fees may be different for each Investment Option. The maximum current fee is 0.25%. The amount of these fees, if deducted from Investment Option assets, is reflected in the above table. 813 EXAMPLES The expenses for your Contract may be different from those shown in the examples below depending upon which Investment Option(s) you select and the benefits that apply. These examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in a Contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. These costs include Contract Owner transaction expenses, Contract Owner periodic expenses, and the annual operating expenses of the Investment Options before the effect of reimbursements and waivers. You should not consider the examples below as a representation of past or future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. We deduct the total $40 contract maintenance charge in the examples at the end of each year during the Accumulation Phase. Please note that this charge does not apply during the Accumulation Phase if your Contract Value, at the end of year is at least $75,000, or during the Annuity Phase if your Contract Value on the Income Date is at least $75,000 (see section 7, Expenses Contract Maintenance Charge). A transfer fee may apply, but is not reflected in these examples (see section 7, Expenses Transfer Fee). If you take a full withdrawal at the end of each time period, and assuming a $10,000 investment and a 5% annual return on your money, you may pay expenses as follows. a) February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, 2007 with the Enhanced GMDB (the highest M&E charge of 1.45%). b) February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, 2007 with the Traditional GMDB (the lowest M&E charge of 1.25%). Total annual Investment Option operating expenses before any fee waivers or expense reimbursements of: 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years 1.71% (the maximum Investment Option operating expense) a) $1,159 $1,794 $2,354 $3,867 b) $1,139 $1,735 $2,257 $3, % (the minimum Investment Option operating expense) a) $1,037 $1,429 $1,747 $2,664 b) $1,017 $1,368 $1,644 $2,452 In Alabama, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington, the lower withdrawal charge would result in slightly lower expense examples. If you do not take a full withdrawal or if you take a Full Annuitization* of the Contract at the end of each time period, and assuming a $10,000 investment and a 5% annual return on your money, you may pay expenses as follows. Total annual Investment Option operating expenses before any fee waivers or expense reimbursements of: 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years 1.71% (the maximum Investment Option operating expense) a) $359 $1,094 $1,854 $3,867 b) $339 $1,035 $1,757 $3, % (the minimum Investment Option operating expense) a) $237 $729 $1,247 $2,664 b) $217 $668 $1,144 $2,452 * Traditional Annuity Payments are generally not available until after the second Contract Anniversary in most states, and GMIB Payments are not available until the fifth Contract Anniversary. See Appendix A for condensed financial information regarding the Accumulation Unit values (AUVs) for the highest and lowest M&E charges for the February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, See the appendix to the Statement of Additional Information for condensed financial information regarding the AUVs for other expense levels. 914 1. THE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT The Contract is no longer offered for sale. However, as an existing Owner you can make additional Purchase Payments to your Contract during the Accumulation Phase, subject to the restrictions set out in section 2, Purchase Purchase Payments. We no longer accept additional Purchase Payments to Contracts issued in all states except Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey. An annuity is a contract between you (the Owner), and an insurance company (in this case Allianz Life), where you make payments to us and, in turn, we promise to make regular periodic payments (Annuity Payments) to the Payee. The Contract is tax deferred. You generally are not taxed on any earnings or appreciation on the assets in your Contract until you take money out of your Contract. For Qualified Contracts, the tax deferral is provided through compliance with specialized tax-qualification rules, and you do not receive any additional tax benefit by purchasing the Contract. The Contract has an Accumulation Phase and an Annuity Phase. You can take withdrawals from the Contract during the Accumulation Phase. The Accumulation Phase begins on the Issue Date and ends upon the earliest of the following. The Business Day before the Income Date if you take a Full Annuitization. The Business Day we process your request for a full withdrawal. Upon the death of any Owner (or the Annuitant if the Contract is owned by a non-individual), the Business Day we first receive in Good Order at our Service Center the death benefit payment option and due proof of death from any one Beneficiary, unless the surviving spouse/beneficiary continues the Contract. If there are multiple Beneficiaries, the remaining Contract Value continues to fluctuate with the performance of the Investment Options until the complete distribution of the death benefit. The Annuity Phase is the period during which we make Annuity Payments from the Contract. Under all Contracts, Traditional Annuity Payments are available during the Annuity Phase. Traditional Annuity Payments must begin on a designated date (the Income Date) that is at least two years after your Issue Date. For Contracts with a GMIB, you can request fixed Annuity Payments (GMIB Payments) beginning on the fifth Contract Anniversary. If you apply the entire Contract Value to Annuity Payments, we call that a Full Annuitization, and if you apply only part of the Contract Value to Annuity Payments, we call that a Partial Annuitization.* The maximum number of annuitizations you can have at any one time is five. Because the Contract allows Partial Annuitization, it is possible that some portions of the Contract are in the Accumulation Phase and other portions are in the Annuity Phase at the same time. The Annuity Phase begins on the Income Date (or the first Income Date if you take any Partial Annuitizations) and ends when all portion(s) of the Contract that you apply to Annuity Payments have ended, as indicated in section 3, The Annuity Phase. * GMIB Partial Annuitizations are based on the GMIB value and are not available until the fifth Contract Anniversary and they are not available if the GMIB value is less than the Contract Value. Your Investment Choices include the Investment Options and any available general account Investment Choice. You cannot invest in more than 15 Investment Options at any one time. Depending upon market conditions, you can gain or lose value in the Contract based on the investment performance of the Investment Options. The Investment Options are designed to offer the opportunity for a better return than any available general account Investment Choice; however, this is not guaranteed. The amount of Contract Value you are able to accumulate in your Contract during the Accumulation Phase and the amount of any variable Traditional Annuity Payments we make during the Annuity Phase depend in large part upon the investment performance of any Investment Options you select. 1015 The only general account Investment Choices available during the Accumulation Phase are the Fixed Period Accounts (FPAs). You can allocate up to 50% of any Purchase Payment to the FPAs during the Accumulation Phase. However, in some states, the FPAs may only be available for GAV Transfers we make if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees. In addition, we may transfer more than 50% of the total Purchase Payments to the FPAs beginning on the second Contract Anniversary in order to support the Living Guarantees. The FPAs have Account Periods ranging from one to ten years. Only one FPA is available for Purchase Payments or transfers in each Contract Year. Amounts allocated to the FPAs earn interest that we declare periodically. If you have money invested in the FPAs, the amount of Contract Value you are able to accumulate in your Contract during the Accumulation Phase depends in part upon the total interest credited to your Contract. Withdrawals or transfers from the FPAs may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment. For more information, please see section 5, Our General Account Market Value Adjustment (MVA). We do not make any changes to your Contract without your permission except as may be required by law. The Contract ends when: the Accumulation Phase ends, the Annuity Phase, if any, ends and/or if we received a Valid Claim, all applicable death benefit payments have been made. For example, if you purchased a Contract and later take a full withdrawal of the entire Contract Value, both the Accumulation Phase and the Contract end although the Annuity Phase never began and we did not make any death benefit payments. State Specific Contract Restrictions The Contract is subject to the law of the state in which it was issued. Some of the terms of your Contract may differ from the terms of a Contract delivered in another state because of state-specific legal requirements. Areas in which there may be state-specific Contract provisions may include, but are not limited to, the following. The withdrawal charge schedule. Availability of Investment Options, Annuity Options, DCA programs, endorsements, and/or riders. Selection of certain Income Dates. Selection of certain assumed investment rates for variable Annuity Payments. Our ability to restrict transfer rights. All material state variations in the Contract are disclosed in this prospectus. If you would like more information regarding state-specific Contract provisions, you should contact your Financial Professional or contact our Service Center at the toll free number listed at the back of this prospectus. OWNERSHIP Owner You, as the Owner, have all the rights under the Contract. The Owner was designated at Contract issue. The Owner may be a non-individual, which is anything other than an individual person, which could be a trust, qualified plan, or corporation. Qualified Contracts can only have one Owner. You can change Owners at any time subject to our approval. Upon our approval, any ownership change becomes effective as of the date you sign the request. Changing ownership may be a taxable event. You should consult with your tax adviser before doing this. Joint Owner Non-Qualified Contracts can be owned by up to two Owners. Upon the death of either Joint Owner, the surviving Joint Owner becomes the sole primary Beneficiary. We then treat any other Beneficiary designation on record at the time of death as a contingent Beneficiary. You can change Joint Owners under the same conditions as described for an Owner. If a Contract has Joint Owners, we generally require the signature of both Owners on any forms that are submitted to our Service Center. NOTE: Partial Annuitizations are not available to Joint Owners. There can be only one Owner, the Owner must be the Annuitant, and we do not allow the Owner to add a joint Annuitant. 1116 Annuitant The Annuitant is the individual on whose life we base Annuity Payments. You designated an Annuitant when you purchased a Contract. For Qualified Contracts, before the Income Date the Owner must be the Annuitant unless the Contract is owned by a qualified plan or is part of a custodial arrangement. You can change the Annuitant on an individually owned Non-Qualified Contract at any time before the Income Date, but you cannot change the Annuitant if the Owner is a non-individual (for example, a qualified plan or trust). Subject to our approval, you can add a joint Annuitant on the Income Date if you take a Full Annuitization. For Qualified Contracts, the ability to add a joint Annuitant is subject to any plan requirements associated with the Contract, and the joint Annuitants must be spouses. For jointly owned Contracts, if the Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date, the younger Owner automatically becomes the new Annuitant, but the Owner can subsequently name another Annuitant. Designating different persons as Owner(s) and Annuitant(s) can have important impacts on whether a death benefit is paid, and on who would receive it. For example, if a sole Owner dies during the Accumulation Phase of the Contract, we pay a death benefit to the Beneficiary(s). If the Annuitant is not an Owner and he/she dies during the Accumulation Phase of the Contract, the Owner can name a new Annuitant (subject to our approval) and we do not pay a death benefit. If a sole Owner who is not an Annuitant dies during the Annuity Phase, the Beneficiary becomes the Owner, Annuity Payments continue and we do not pay a death benefit. If an Annuitant dies after a Full Annuitization under an Annuity Option with a guaranteed period, Annuity Payments to the Payee continue until the Contract ends and are paid at least as rapidly as they were being paid at the time of the Annuitant s death. Use care when designating Owners and Annuitants, and consult your Financial Professional if you have questions. Payee The Payee is the person or entity who receives Annuity Payments during the Annuity Phase. The Owner receives tax reporting on those payments. Generally we require the Payee to be an Owner. However, we may allow you to name a charitable trust, financial institution, qualified plan, or an individual specified in a court order as a Payee subject to our approval. For Qualified Contracts owned by a qualified plan, the qualified plan must be the Payee. Beneficiary The Beneficiary is the person(s) or entity you designated at Contract issue to receive any death benefit. You can change the Beneficiary or contingent Beneficiary at any time before your death unless you name an irrevocable Beneficiary. If a Beneficiary predeceases you, or you and a Beneficiary die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation, that Beneficiary s interest in this Contract ends unless your Beneficiary designation specifies otherwise. If there are no surviving Beneficiaries or if there is no named Beneficiary, we pay the death benefit to your estate or the Owner if the Owner is a non-individual. NOTE FOR JOINTLY OWNED CONTRACTS: The sole primary Beneficiary is the surviving Joint Owner regardless of any other named Beneficiaries. Spousal Joint Owners may also appoint contingent Beneficiaries. However, Joint Owners who are not spouses may not appoint contingent Beneficiaries. If both Joint Owners who were never spouses die before we pay the death benefit, we pay the death benefit to the estate of the Joint Owner who died last. If both spousal Joint Owners die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation, we pay the death benefit to the named contingent Beneficiaries, or to the estate of the spousal Joint Owner who died last if there are no named contingent Beneficiaries. Assignments, Changes of Ownership and Other Transfers of Contract Rights You can assign your rights under this Contract to someone else during the Accumulation Phase. An assignment may be absolute or limited, and includes changes of ownership, collateral assignments, or any other transfer of specific Contract rights. After an assignment, you may need the consent of the assignee of record to exercise certain Contract rights depending on the type of assignment and the rights assigned. You must submit your request to assign the Contract in writing to our Service Center and we must approve it in writing. To the extent permitted by state law, we reserve the right to refuse to consent to any assignment at any time on a nondiscriminatory basis. We will not consent if the assignment would violate or result in noncompliance with any applicable state or federal law or regulation. Upon our consent, we record the assignment. We are not responsible for the validity or effect of the assignment. We are not liable for any actions we take or payments we make before we receive your request in Good Order and record it. 1217 Assigning the Contract does not change, revoke or replace the originally named Annuitant or Beneficiary; if you also want to change the Annuitant or Beneficiary you must make a separate request. An assignment may be a taxable event. In addition, there are other restrictions on changing the ownership of a Qualified Contract and Qualified Contracts generally cannot be assigned absolutely or on a limited basis. You should consult with your tax adviser before assigning this Contract. 2. PURCHASE PURCHASE PAYMENTS We no longer accept additional Purchase Payments to Contracts issued in all states except Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey. The Purchase Payment requirements for Contracts issued in Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey are as follows. You can make additional Purchase Payments of $50 or more during the Accumulation Phase. You cannot make any additional Purchase Payments to the Contract after the Income Date that you take a Full Annuitization (including a required Full Annuitization on the maximum permitted Income Date). In certain states, additional Purchase Payments can only be made during the first Contract Year or may be otherwise restricted. The maximum total amount we accept without our prior approval is $1 million (including amounts already invested in other Allianz Life variable annuities). If you purchased this Contract as an Inherited IRA, the death benefit proceeds of the previous tax-qualified investment were directly transferred into this Contract (see section 9, Access to Your Money The Minimum Distribution Program and Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Payments). A beneficiary can apply the death benefit proceeds from multiple tax-qualified investments that were owned by the same owner to the purchase of an Inherited IRA Contract. We do not accept any other forms of Purchase Payment on an Inherited IRA Contract. The death benefit proceeds cannot be received by the beneficiary and then applied to an Inherited IRA Contract. For more information on Inherited IRA Contracts, see section 8, Taxes Qualified Contracts Inherited IRA. Purchase Payments to Qualified Contracts are limited by federal law and must be from earned income or a qualified transfer or rollover. Purchase Payments to Qualified Contracts other than from a qualified transfer may be restricted after the Owner reaches age 70½. We may, at our sole discretion, waive the minimum Purchase Payment requirements. We reserve the right to decline any Purchase Payment, and if mandated under applicable law, we may be required to reject a Purchase Payment. AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT PLAN (AIP) The AIP is no longer available to Contracts issued in all states except Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey. The automatic investment plan (AIP) is a program that allows you to make additional Purchase Payments to your Contract during the Accumulation Phase on a monthly or quarterly basis by electronic transfer of money from your savings, checking or brokerage account. You may participate in this program by completing the appropriate form. Our Service Center must receive your form in Good Order by the 15th of the month (or the next Business Day if the 15th is not a Business day) in order for AIP to begin that same month. Investments take place on the 20th of the month or the next Business Day if the 20th is not a Business Day. The minimum investment that you can make by AIP is $50. You may stop or change AIP at any time. We must be notified by the first of the month in order to stop or change AIP for that month. If AIP is used for a Qualified Contract, you should consult your tax adviser for advice regarding maximum contributions. AIP is not available if the Qualified Contract is funding a plan that is tax qualified under Section 401of the Internal Revenue Code. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify AIP at any time and for any reason. AIP is not available if your Contract is funding a plan that is tax qualified under Section 401 or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or after the Income Date on which you take a Full Annuitization. 1318 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS We allocate your Purchase Payments to the Investment Choices you select. We ask that you allocate your money in whole percentages. Transfers of Contract Value between Investment Choices do not change the future allocation instructions. If you do not change your allocation instructions, we allocate any additional Purchase Payments according to your future Purchase Payment allocation instructions. You can only allocate up to 50% of any Purchase Payment to the FPAs during the Accumulation Phase. In some states, you cannot make allocations to the FPAs and they may only be available for GAV Transfers we make. In addition, if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees, we may transfer more than 50% of the total Purchase Payments to the FPAs beginning on the second Contract Anniversary. You can change your future allocation instructions at any time without fee or penalty. Future allocation instruction changes are effective on the Business Day we receive them in Good Order at our Service Center. If you change your future allocation instructions and you are participating in the dollar cost averaging program or the flexible rebalancing program, this change does not automatically apply to your allocation instructions for these programs. We accept changes to future allocation instructions from any Owner unless you instruct otherwise. We may allow you to authorize someone else to change allocation instructions on your behalf. We reserve the right to limit the number of Investment Options that you can invest in at any one time. Currently, you can invest in up to 15 of the Investment Options at any one time. We may change this in the future; however, we always allow you to invest in at least five Investment Options. If you make additional Purchase Payments, we add this money to your Contract on the Business Day we receive it in Good Order. Our Business Day closes when regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange closes. If you submit a Purchase Payment to your Financial Professional, we do not begin processing the payment until we receive it. A Purchase Payment is received when it arrives at the address for mailing checks listed at the back of this prospectus regardless of how or when you submitted the payment. We forward Purchase Payments we receive at the wrong address to the last address listed at the back of this prospectus (1350 Energy Lane, Suite 200), which may delay processing. TAX-FREE SECTION 1035 EXCHANGES Subject to certain restrictions, you can make a tax-free exchange under Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code for all or a portion of one annuity contract for another, or all of a life insurance policy for an annuity contract. Before making an exchange, you should compare both contracts carefully. Remember that if you exchange a life insurance policy or annuity contract for the Contract described in this prospectus: you might have to pay a withdrawal charge on your previous contract, there is a new withdrawal charge period for this Contract, other charges under this Contract may be higher (or lower), the benefits may be different, and you no longer have access to any benefits from your previous contract. If the exchange does not qualify for Section 1035 treatment, you also may have to pay federal income tax, including a possible additional federal tax, on the exchange. You should not exchange an existing life insurance policy or another annuity contract for this Contract unless you determine the exchange is in your best interest and not just better for the person selling you the Contract who generally earns a commission on each sale. You should consult a tax adviser to discuss the potential tax effects before making a 1035 exchange. 1419 ACCUMULATION UNITS/COMPUTING THE CONTRACT VALUE Your Contract Value in the subaccounts (Separate Account Value) increase and decrease based upon the investment performance of the Investment Option(s) you choose. Your Contract Value is also affected by the charges of the Contract, any interest you earn on any general account Investment Choices, and any MVAs made due to amounts removed from the FPAs. In order to keep track of your Separate Account Value, we use a measurement called an Accumulation Unit. If you request variable Traditional Annuity Payments during the Annuity Phase of the Contract, we call this measurement an Annuity Unit. When we receive a Purchase Payment, we credit your Contract with Accumulation Units for any portion of your Purchase Payment allocated to an Investment Option at the daily price next determined after receipt of the Purchase Payment at our Service Center. The daily purchase price is normally determined at the end of each Business Day, and any Purchase Payment received at or after the end of the current Business Day receives the next Business Day s price. The Purchase Payments you allocate to the Investment Options are actually placed into subaccounts. Each subaccount invests exclusively in one Investment Option. We determine the number of Accumulation Units we credit to your Contract by dividing the amount of the Purchase Payment allocated to a subaccount by the value of the corresponding Accumulation Unit. Every Business Day, we determine the value of an Accumulation Unit for each subaccount by multiplying the Accumulation Unit value for the previous Business Day by the net investment factor for the current Business Day. We determine the net investment factor by: Adding declared distributions (daily interest, dividends, long term gains and short term gains) for an Investment Option to its net asset value (NAV). That result is then divided by the NAV the end of the prior business day to determine the overall daily performance in the Investment Option. That calculation is then multiplied by one minus the current Business Day s mortality and expense risk charge and any additional calendar days since the prior Business Day. We calculate the value of each Accumulation Unit after regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange closes each Business Day. The value of an Accumulation Unit may go up or down from Business Day to Business Day. We calculate your Separate Account Value by multiplying the Accumulation Unit value in each subaccount by the number of Accumulation Units for each subaccount and then adding those results together. (For example, the Contract Value on any Contract Anniversary reflects the number and value of the Accumulation Units at the end of the previous Business Day.) Example On Wednesday, we receive at our Service Center an additional Purchase Payment of $3,000 from you before the end of the Business Day. When the New York Stock Exchange closes on that Wednesday, we determine that the value of an Accumulation Unit for the Investment Option you chose is $ We then divide $3,000 by $13.25 and credit your Contract on Wednesday night with subaccount Accumulation Units for the Investment Option you chose. If the $3,000 payment had been received at or after the end of the current Business Day, it would have received the next Business Day s price. 1520 3. THE ANNUITY PHASE You can apply your Contract Value to regular periodic payments (Annuity Payments). A Full Annuitization occurs when you apply the entire Contract Value to Annuity Payments. A Partial Annuitization occurs when you apply only part of your Contract Value to Annuity Payments.* The Payee receives the Annuity Payments. You receive tax reporting on the payments, whether or not you are the Payee. We may require proof of the Annuitant(s) age before we make any life contingent Annuity Payment. If you misstate the Annuitant(s) age or gender, the amount payable is the amount that would have been provided at the true age or gender. * GMIB Partial Annuitizations are based on the GMIB value and are not available until the fifth Contract Anniversary and they are not available if the GMIB value is less than the Contract Value. INCOME DATE The Income Date is the date Annuity Payments (GMIB Payments or Traditional Annuity Payments) begin. Your scheduled Income Date in your Contract is the maximum permitted Income Date allowed for your Contract, which is the first day of the calendar month following the later of: a) the Annuitant s 90th birthday, or b) the tenth Contract Anniversary. Your scheduled Income Date may be different if the Contract is issued to a charitable remainder trust. An earlier Income Date or a withdrawal may be required to satisfy minimum required distribution rules under certain Qualified Contracts. You can make an authorized request for a different Income Date, but any such request is subject to applicable law and our approval. The extension available to you may vary depending on the Financial Professional you purchased your Contract through and your state of residence. Your Income Date must be the first day of a calendar month and must be at least two years after the Issue Date. Some states may require us to allow you to select an earlier Income Date. The Income Date cannot be later than what is permitted under applicable law. To receive the annuity income protection of the GMIB, your Income Date must be within 30 days following a Contract Anniversary beginning with the fifth Contract Anniversary (and certain other conditions must also be met). Your election to start Annuity Payments may involve an MVA if any of your Contract Value is in a FPA on the Income Date. NOTE: You must take a Full Annuitization of your total Contract Value on the maximum permitted Income Date if, at that time, your Contract Value is greater than zero. We base your Annuity Payments on your Contract Value. If you have not selected an Annuity Option we make payments under the default option described in the Annuity Payments discussion of this section. Upon Full Annuitization you no longer have a Contract Value, any periodic withdrawal or payments (other than Annuity Payments) stop, and the death benefit ends. In addition, if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees, the FPAs and the Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit are no longer available to you and you no longer receive any True Ups. TRADITIONAL ANNUITY PAYMENTS Annuity Payments offer a guaranteed income stream with certain tax advantages and are designed for Owners who are not concerned with continued access to Contract Value. You can request Traditional Annuity Payments under Annuity Options 1-5 as: a variable payout, a fixed payout, or a combination of both. We base Annuity Payments on your Contract Value. Under a fixed payout, all of the Annuity Payments are the same dollar amount (equal installments) except as provided under Annuity Option 3. Guaranteed fixed Traditional Annuity Payments are based on an interest rate and mortality table specified in your Contract. The payout rates for fixed Traditional Annuity Payments provided by your Contract are guaranteed and in no event do we use lower fixed payout rates to calculate your fixed Traditional Annuity Payments. However, we may use higher fixed payout rates to calculate fixed Traditional Annuity Payments than the guaranteed rates provided by your Contract. 16  View more
