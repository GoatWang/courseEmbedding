Artists
Musician of the Month – Neil Chapman












In the words of Neil Chapman:  “Rock Hard Or Don’t Rock At All!!”.
Neil Chapman is one of North America’s most inspiring guitarists. As well as being a first call session player, having recorded with the likes of Dan Hill, Rita McNeil, Rough Trade, The Sattallites, Heat Exchange, Zombo Zombo, Bill King’s Saturday Nite Fish Fry and Alan Frew, he has played on stage with many great artists such as Leonard Cohen, Carol Pope, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Randy Bachman, Leroy Sibbles, Toots and the Maytals, and Maestro Fresh Wes.
Along with Graeme Williamson and Tony Duggan-Smith, Neil is a founding member of Canada’s “National Treasure” THE PUKKA ORCHESTRA, and the offshoots Neotone and Autocondo. He is also a member of ZED HEAD, a classic rock/Texas boogie outfit in the style of the greats of old.
When not touring, Neil keeps busy writing and recording music for documentaries, television and corporate events. As an “Event Musician”, Neil enjoys being band leader and playing live for the corporate crowd throughout the world with his band BIG ROCK ENDING.

Five Fast Facts about Neil
1.    What BOSS/Roland gear is a must have for every gig? BOSS CE-2 chorus pedal.
2.    What is one of the major highlights of your career to date? Playing with Leonard Cohen at the 1994 JUNOS and playing at Madison Square Garden and Maple Leaf Gardens with Leroy Sibbles on the first Bunny Wailer tour after Bob Marley died. Full house!
3.    If you could tell your 10-year-old self one thing, what would it be? I’d tell myself to play the guitar. If you love your job you never have to work a day in your life!
4.    What makes your sound unique? My BOSS CE-2 pedal with everything turned up full! I shouldn’t be telling you this because everyone will try it LOL.  My vibrato and intensity are quite distinct as well.
5.    If you could share the stage with any musician, alive or dead, who would it be and why? Jimi Hendrix. I think he was one of the most innovative players of all time. So much of what we do today was first done by Jimi and Jeff Beck. Jimi’s insane feedback, extreme whammy bar technique, singing over and with his guitar licks really pushed the limits of guitar. His combination of rock, funk, country and some jazz created something very special as well.
Current Projects
Neil and director/producer Russell Walker are currently working on a documentary called “How to make a living playing guitar”. The documentary covers Neil’s career as a professional musician, and talks about how Neil has adapted to and played a multitude of musical styles and trends over his decades-long career, from Blues, to Punk, to Grunge, to Hip Hop,  and through it all has managed to support himself and his family by playing his guitar.
Neil is also working on two new studio albums: “Guitar” and “Hollywood World”. It’s fair to say, Neil is a very busy boy.
