Spotlight on Women: Melissa Claassen Chief Financial Officer 
TaylorMade Golf Company By Joyce A. Glazer


Published: 2013.02.21 10:57 AM

Where are you from? I was born in Australia, but I have lived in several countries. I started my adidas career in Australia and moved up through the ranks working in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and, most recently, Germany. My parents were first-generation immigrants from Holland. I grew up speaking Dutch, but now my German is better than my Dutch after spending three years working at adidas headquarters in Germany. English is my third language.

How long have you been in San Diego? I moved here 10 months ago when I was promoted to my current position. Fortunately, my husband, Edo Fuijkschot, is an illustration artist, so he can live and work anywhere. We have a five-year-old daughter, Lana.

How did you advance your career? It was not a planned path for me. It was really being flexible and recognizing opportunities. When I was in Australia, I realized the CFO was going to be there for a while so I decided to look beyond adidas. He suggested that I stay with adidas and look beyond Australia to explore other opportunities. My next move was with adidas global.

Who was your role model? The managing director of adidas group greater China. He encouraged me to learn the marketing side of the business, and then I began to think about how to activate the brand to get some commercial sensibilities. I believe that the “new CFO” is a business partner and copilot, rather than the “numbers cruncher” of the past. As a financial professional I interact with the marketing, product, sales, and retail teams. I see every facet of the business through the numbers.

What obstacles have you had to overcome as a woman? Sports is a male-dominated industry, but I never defined myself as a woman. I am, however, the first woman board member in TaylorMade Golf Company. I think they were more afraid than I was.

What do you consider to be your greatest accomplishment? In 2011 I was named one of the Top 50 Australian women leaders at the 50 For The Future, Advance Women’s Leadership Summit. The Honorable Julia Gillard, Australian Prime Minister, addressed the summit. Then in 2012 I was honored with the “Best People Leader,” voted by financial people from around the adidas group.

What else should we know about you? I believe in the financial world it’s all about transparencies. We should present the best information possible. I have been with the company for 18 years. I have to feel the company that I am working for is doing a good thing in supporting their community. Since I moved to San Diego I have joined the EDC board and the YMCA board, plus participating in team-sponsored events.

At the young age of 40, you were promoted to worldwide CFO. Where to from here? My career was built around innovation and challenging the status quo. I am all about moving out of your comfort zone. I have no future plan, just open to all opportunities.

 Customer Reviews       Highest Rated Newest Oldest Lowest Rated  GO      Kat On September 22, 2016
 Recommended                 "Sweet Melissa" I had never used Melissa before I recently purchased it from Plant Therapy.  I really like it.  I am prone to panic attacks, and just sniffing Melissa for a few seconds is very tranquilizing and calming.  Using Melissa has helped prevent and deal with the after affects of having panic attacks.  You do not need a lot of it  which will stretch your supply.  If you use too much Melissa or diffuse it for too long, it will withdraw maybe too much body mucous (dries your body out) and relaxes your muscles a bit too much.  Enjoy it in small doses when you need it.  It is so helpful for those with anxiety disorders like PTSD as well as for daily anxiety.  The best thing about it?  You have feelings of joy and peace, and your heart begins to sing again!  So uplifting!      Kristi On January 3, 2017
 Recommended                 Miracle Oil I suffer from occasional canker sores, and there's nothing that helps like Melissa. Nothing. I've used Dentist prescribed mouthwash, other EOs, over the counter medications, and the only thing that relieves the pain and quickly heals the sore is Melissa. I know it's expensive, but for me it's more valuable than a prescription costing the same amount of money, because it works. It's also great for depression, calming and soothing. I never want to be without this oil.      WW On January 21, 2017
 Recommended                 Worth the Investment I absolutely love this oil in blends. I put a couple of drops on a cotton ball and placed in my guitar case. I'm rewarded with a faint scent of Melissa every time I play. So soothing and relaxing. The price initially scared me but I'm so glad I made the investment.  Melissa is quickly becoming one of my bedtime favorites.       Melissa On April 2, 2017
 Recommended                 MELISSA Wow!  Not only does this oil smell amazing (think of the lemon balm plant) but for me, it has an instant calming and motivating effect.  Lack of sunshine this time of year really bums me out but this oil makes me happy.  I have it in an inhaler mixed with lavender and I plan to put it in my necklace.      Patricia On April 11, 2017
 Recommended                 amazing scent Its a bit pricey but so worth it! The scent is amazing.  It really uplifts my moods.

Not all essential oils are created equal, and neither are the companies that sell them.
Whether you know nothing about essential oils and are just starting to research them or you have been using them for many, many years, we all have one thing in common: we want the purest and highest quality essential oils available.
There are many companies that sell essential oils. What makes Plant Therapy different? What makes Plant Therapy the best essential oil company?
The PEOPLE. The owners. The management team. The aromatherapist team. The customer service team. The warehouse team. And last but not least, the BEST customers. We go above and beyond just selling the highest quality essential oils. We want to do more. That is why we created the first ever full line of KidSafe® synergies. Formulated by Robert Tisserand, parents can know without a doubt that they are helping bless the lives of their children with the safest and most effective oils on the market for their young ones.

About the People







The Owners
Chris and Amanda Jones both grew up near Twin Falls, Idaho. They married in 2002 and soon after started a family that has grown into four beautiful daughters. Growing up around entrepreneurs and a mother who was a certified aromatherapist, Chris and Amanda saw the need for a different kind of essential oil company. One where you could find the highest quality essential oils at a more affordable price. They wanted to make a difference and they have!
"Our ultimate goal is not to be the largest essential oil company; it is to positively impact the lives of as many people as humanly possible. Ultimately, I feel this is possible only by providing our customers with an exceptional experience that keeps them coming back. By selling such a high quality product at an affordable price, we not only positively affect the lives of our customers, it also gives us the financial means by which we can help those who are less fortunate to live a happier, healthier, and more productive life."
-Chris Jones







The Management Team
Chris, Retha, Paul and Lori. We are just one big happy family. No, really, we are! Paul and Retha are brother and sister. Chris is our brother-in-law. Although Lori isn’t technically related, we will claim her! We don’t think there is anything better than working with family. It is said, that family run businesses "have a longer-term view of investment, they're more stable, and inspire more trust and commitment in their employees." -Business Insider
We get so much more done at our board meetings when we don’t have to beat around the bush. Decisions get made a lot quicker this way!

The Aromatherapist Team
How many companies have a full team of Aromatherapists on staff to answer any aromatherapy questions you have? Well, Plant Therapy does! Quality, education and safety are all very important to Plant Therapy, and our aromatherapist team is here to help YOU. Whether you are just starting out and know nothing about essential oils or you are well oiled, we can help! Our Aromatherapists want your essential oil experience to be the absolute best it can be by getting the most out of the oils you already have or the ones you want to have.

The Customer Service Team
You will quickly learn who they are and you will quickly learn to love them. Our customer service team is the best there is. Why? Because they truly care. They care about you. They care about your experience. They care about the quality of products you receive. They want you to have the best experience you could possibly have while learning about essential oils, searching essential oils and buying essential oils. They are always on YOUR side!

The Warehouse Team

Plant Therapy is growing faster than we could have ever imagined and the warehouse team is always working overtime to keep up. They are the behind-the-scenes powerhouse!

The Best Customers
Some of you might be wondering why our customers are on the list of what makes Plant Therapy the best essential oil company? Let me tell you. Our customers know essential oils.

-Product Related Questions-
Q. Are Plant Therapy’s Essential Oils Therapeutic Grade?
A. All of Plant Therapy’s oils are 100% pure, free from any additives, adulterants or dilutions. They are of the absolute highest quality and are ideal for use in aromatherapy.
 Since there is no organization that oversees the quality of essential oils, ‘Therapeutic Grade’ is simply a marketing term. Any company can say their oils are therapeutic grade. Some companies use other therapeutic grade terms, or other grading or certifying terms, for internal quality standards. However, these terms are often trademarked by the company.
 When looking for the highest quality oils, don’t look for terms such as ‘Therapeutic Grade’ since any company can use this term. Since there is no actual third party grading or certifying of essential oils, it is best to look for a company that ensures the quality of their oils based on test results and experts. Some tests that are important when ensuring the quality of an essential oil are GC/MS (Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer) tests and organoleptic test. Please head on over to Plant Therapy’s ‘Quality’ page to read more about what we do to guarantee our oils are of the highest quality.


Q. Are Plant Therapy’s Essential Oils Organic?
A. Many are but not all. We work very hard with our suppliers to provide oils that come from organically grown plants. That being said, we only carry a small line of certified organic oils. These oils are clearly labeled and our line of certified organic oils and synergies is continually growing. If you are looking for a guarantee that the oil was grown organically and follows the organic standards, we recommend you purchase our certified organic oils. Since many small farmers cannot afford to certify their organically grown plants, the only way to guarantee the oil is organic, is to purchase a certified organic oil.

Q. Can Plant Therapy’s Essential Oils Be Used Internally?
A. We do not recommend the general internal use of essential oils. Essential oils are highly concentrated and have the capacity to cause serious damage if used internally without the necessary expertise required in administering them. We do have customers who choose to use our oils internally. However, we recommend it only be done with great respect for the power of essential oils, under the direction of someone who is qualified in the internal use of essential oils and someone who truly understands the chemical makeup of each individual oil, and NOT on a daily basis.


Q. Are Any of Plant Therapy’s Essential Oils Redistilled (1st, 2nd, 3rd distillation)?
A. Most essential oils do not need to be redistilled. The only time this happens is if you are trying to remove some of the minor constituents found in the essential oil. Most often this is done for the food flavoring industry. This is also done for toxic substances such as hydrocyanic acid (cyanide) in bitter almond oil. Because cyanide is so toxic, this oil is legally required to be redistilled. In these cases, the plant would be distilled and then the essential oil would be fractionally distilled, or redistilled, to remove these minor constituents.
The only oil that we carry that has been fractionally distilled is our Bergamot. Bergamot is a highly phototoxic essential oil. Plant Therapy’s Bergamot is known as bergapten free. This means that the chemical constituent that makes Bergamot so phototoxic, bergapten, has been removed from our Bergamot making it safe to use in the sun.

Q. How Are Plant Therapy’s Essential Oils Extracted?
A. Most of Plant Therapy’s essential oils are extracted using steam distillation. Our citrus oils are extracted using cold pressed extraction. We also carry a few CO2 extracted oils and also a few solvent extracted absolutes. Here is some more information about the different methods of extraction.
 Steam Distillation: The most common process of extracting an essential oil is by distillation, a process that isolates the aromatic, volatile element of the plant with steam.
 Cold Pressed: Expression, or cold pressing, is used primarily for citrus fruits like orange and lemon, where the essential oil is obtained in tiny pockets in the peel or rind. Oils extracted by cold pressing are the most volatile of essential oils and can evaporate quickly when exposed to air.  CO2 Extraction: The CO2 extraction method yields a greater number of aromatic compounds than any other distillation process, making this extraction method one of our personal favorites! In certain conditions at a low temperature Carbon Dioxide or CO2 can be pressurized to become a liquid. This liquid then acts as a solvent and is used to extract the oil from plants. After extraction is completed, the extraction vessel is brought back to normal temperature and the CO2 rapidly converts to gas, leaving behind a high quality oil that is free of solvents.
 Solvent Extraction (only used for absolutes): Flowers too delicate to be processed with heat are soaked in a solvent, usually hexane that extracts the volatile elements. The solvent is then evaporated leaving only the most fragrant constituents behind. This process produces what is called an "absolute". Here is a more in depth step by step process: 1) Plant material is macerated in a solvent. Usually hexane. 2) After several days the solvent is removed, leaving the viscous, fragrant concrete. 3) The concrete is dissolved with high proof alcohol. 4) The mixture is chilled, and separates into plant waxes and fragrant tincture. 5) The fragrant tincture is vacuum distilled to evaporate off the alcohol, leaving an absolute. All absolutes are extracted using solvent extraction.


-Usage Related Questions-
 
Q. Why Are Some Oils Unsafe To Use On Or Around Children?
A. There are many reasons why some essential oils are not recommended to be used on or around children. Some of these reasons are toxicity concerns, adverse skin reactions and breathing problems. Children are more at risk because they are smaller and therefore more susceptible to toxic substances, their metabolism is less effective than an adults, their skin is thinner and not as mature as an adults, and they are more susceptible to respiratory issues. To view a list of oils that ARE safe to use on or around children, please visit our KidSafe section.


Q. Why Should Certain Oils Be Avoided During Pregnancy?
A. Certain essentials oils are considered too powerful for use during pregnancy as they may stimulate the production of certain hormones and can encourage bleeding. Please consult your physician or contact our aromatherapists at aromatherapist@planttherapy.com before using essential oils while pregnant.

Q. Do I Need To Dilute Plant Therapy’s Essential oils When Using Topically?
A. Short answer, yes. Essential oils are volatile meaning that they evaporate very quickly. When you dilute essential oils, the evaporation process is much slower because they are diluted in non-volatile substances. The carrier oil then carries the essential oil into the skin which means that you can use less essential oil. Additionally, the therapeutic benefits of a carrier oil often increases the therapeutic benefits of the essential oil!
