Michael formed part of the team that helped develop, design and manufacture the Glasgow 2014 Queen's Baton. His foresight and input was instrumental in creating a truly innovative, recognisable and unforgettable baton that has set new heights for future baton's. Michael's diligence and tenacity throughout the project confirms to me that he would be a great attribute to any of his future endeavours.


 
Adam BestProgram Manager International - Queen's Baton Relay 





I had the pleasure of working with Michael for over 4 years at 4c Design Ltd and found his passion for design and engineering quite infectious. Part of the culture at 4c was to 'build to think' which he embraced whole-heartedly making good use of the workshop to develop early prototypes. A great addition to any team!


 
William MitchellDesign Director at 4c Design 





During the time that I worked with Michael he always conducted himself in a highly professional manner and displayed a wide variety of design skills. Over and above this set of skills he clearly has a natural ability to design great products. He was a great colleague and I wish him every success in the future.


 
Matt PhelanMechanical Engineer at Tannoy 





Michael is someone you can trust and rely upon to get the job done. Right from the beginning of the project Michael went out his way to understand exactly what we were trying to achieve. Very talented and very creative, I strongly recommend Michael if you have an idea for a new product!


 
Gavin OattesSpeaker, Comedian and Managing Director at Tree of Knowledge 





Working with Michael is an absolute pleasure, he’s not only enthusiastic and passionate about product design & engineering he’s a complete professional every step of the way, not many people have that mix in my experience. All you need to do is meet him once and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.


 
Alan FairDirector at Contact Online Ltd 





Michael is an absolute pleasure to work with. He is energetic, imaginative, committed and brings a fresh perspective and new ideas to the Glasgow & SW Scotland Area Committee. He commits a significant amount of time to volunteering for the IMechE and has made a valuable contribution in raising the profile of the Committee and the engineering profession.


 
Dean BoyceEngineer at Energy Technology Centre and IMechE Glasgow Chairman 





Michael is a true gem in the crown that is 4c Designs. I commissioned 4c Designs to work with me on FreeFlow Technologies Electric Bike project and Michael was an integral part of that team.

Michael's sheer grasp of understanding what is mechanically or theoretically possible is endless, this strives him on to create what the rest of the world deem impossible.

Thank you Michael for bearing with me on all the design challenges we came across in building the Saltire City.

I would not hesitate to recommend Michael for any Mechanical Design work or Design in general for that matter!!

There are so many misconceptions regarding the ‘green’ issue. Some people whole heartily support it, while others seem to actively rebel against it. I heard someone just the other day dismissing the topic as “just trying to save a polar bear”… and it really got under my skin.
I heard someone making a case for “going green” from a self-preservation point of view and find it appropriate here.  What is it we are actually being asked to do? Turn off unused lights, turn down your heating and insulate your home etc. Does each of these not save you money! On a broader scale, purchase greener products, recycle and walk rather than drive to work. I fail to see what is so offensive about that, in fact if we did so we would all be fitter and healthier!
You need to remember that “saving the earth” is not all about tree hugging and saving a solitary polar bear, it’s saving entire eco systems, entire crops and resources that we ultimately depend upon. The earth will be fine whatever we do… this is about saving ourselves and future generations. And all it takes is a little consideration of the world we inhabit through sustainable design and lifestyle choices.

That brings me to the question of what defines a ‘green’ product? What is green product design? If a car uses less fuel because of a hybrid engine, does that make it environmentally friendly? Not if the engine requires materials mined from the deepest, darkest depths of the rainforest.  If a product uses recycled materials does that make it ‘green’? Only if those recycled materials are obtained, transported and utilised in a manner more efficient than its traditional alternative. The key to creating a truly ‘green’ product is in looking at the life cycle of all materials involved. Are the materials and processes sustainable?
Ultimately if a product is loved, it will be used frequently, kept for years and keep on functioning. A great example of this is my Swiss Army Knife, it has worked faultlessly since I got it when I was 12 and it has great sentimental value to me. So much so that when I discovered I had left it on a picnic bench when hiking, I hiked hours back to find it again to my great relief. It has had a hard life, but I have taken care of it so have no doubt it will be with me for many years to come. I don’t care how it was made, what materials it’s made from, but I would argue this is a ‘green’ product because it will endure where others find themselves in landfills or rusting underneath some picnic bench.
Bottom line… green design must be sustainable, inclusive and most importantly good design (valued / useful / functional / practical / durable / ergonomic / user friendly).
