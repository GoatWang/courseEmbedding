John S. D’Orazio
 
John D’Orazio was born in Hampton Rhodes, Virginia in 1951. His family moved to greater Atlanta when he was five years old and he has remained in the area since. He graduated from Sequoyah High School in Doraville and subsequently attended Georgia State University where he graduated with a Business Degree. Although he majored in marketing, he had a great interest in business law. 
Following graduation from college, John joined Sentry Insurance Company as a claims representative. He gained valuable experience there serving both as an office and field claims rep. On several occasions, he was called out of town to assist other offices in resolving their excess claim load. During his tenure at Sentry Insurance Company, John’s interest in law was reignited. He decided to pursue a career in the legal profession and with that in mind, joined the Atlanta law firm of Ross & Finch as an investigator while also enrolling in law school.
 
On completing his Juris Doctor degree and passing the bar exam, John joined the firm (at that time known as Finch, McCranie, Brown and Blank), as an associate attorney. Over the ensuing years, he became a partner in that firm. While practicing with the firm, John had the opportunity to be tutored by attorneys with decades of trial experience and litigate matters in numerous courts across the United States. His practice even involved in traveling abroad to help supervise litigation in Great Britain. It was during this “British Invasion” that John had the opportunity to travel and work with Robert Webb.
In 1992, John and Robert formed the firm of Webb & D’Orazio. Together, John and Robert bring almost seventy years of combined legal experience to bear in behalf of their clients.
John’s areas of concentration are in the areas of personal injury, wrongful death, malpractice, slip and fall and workers’ compensation. In addition, John is involved in business related litigation and other business matters for a variety of local businesses.
In his spare time, John enjoys spending time with his son and daughter. He is also an avid motorcycle enthusiast riding both street and dirt. John is an amateur mechanic, welder and farmer.

John D'Orazio Salon





















Vogue - March 2013"High & Mighty", p.615
"I have another party coming up, and Kevin's out of town. My editor books me in with hairdresser John D'Orazio. 'He did a wild, over-the-top beehive for one of the guests at the Met gala,' she says.
                "D'Orazio's salon is on Madison, above the Ralph Lauren children's shop. He has a 25-year history on this block. His salon is an old-school classic: mirrored French doors, coffee, chatting, and an offered plate of chocolates.
                "He recalls the theatrical style he'd done for vintage dealer Juliana Cairone's Met look. 'It was decorated with beetles in honor of the Schiaparelli exhibition, which called for something exotic, for glamour.'
                "D'Orazio's father had a barbership in Brooklyn; his mother had a salon next door. At eleven years old, he began styling his mother's hair. 'I loved it. By thirteen, I was completely booked.' For his first beehive, he used a can of Ozon hair spray, wrapping the hair around the actual can.
                "For modern-day hair, D'Orazio has developed his own line of preshaped add-ons. He shows me a cone that is my exact color match, but then I become entranced with a streaky tortoiseshell length of hair, stiff but bendable. Like the cone, the ribbon-like shape, created by adhering high-quality hair to both sides of a length of lace organza, has sewn-in clips to anchor it. He clips the piece atop my head and wraps it around itself, the interior hollow, the sides glossy and smooth.
                "'Isn't this fun?' he asks, the color-blocked effect highlighting the beehive's geometry. The finished look is aerodynamic and light to wear.
                "'I used to wonder, What is future hair?' muses D'Orazio as I'm getting up to leave. 'The hair in the sixties was so futuristic; then the future came.'
                "And it was filled with blow-dry bars?
                "He nods.
                "I walk out of the salon, hair and head held high, feeling empowered. The future is now."

"It was a huge honor for me to be mentioned in the article on this year's Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations Met Gala. ...
"The fabulous hair was created by the masterful John D'Orazio who made it even bigger then I could have imagined possible.  In the photo below my giant hair meets the little insects...  John was so focused he was not even a little bit squeamish.
"Almost ready to go.  The hair was so big I basically had to crawl in and out of the car!  The insects are real and there were butterflies in the front.

VibrantNation.com"Hair Restoration for Women over 50: Female Hair Transplants, Wigs, and Hairpieces Designed Just for Us"
"One of the most famous specialists in supplemental hair is John D'Orazio, whose discreet but pricey work with hairpieces and wigs graces the heads of women in the news as well as everyday women dealing with hair loss. His two elegant salons, one at 872 Madison Avenue in New York City, and the other in Water Mill, New York on Long Island, are a headquarters for women wanting a non-medical alternative.
"Made from real hair, John's full wigs are expensive - around $10,000 - but they provide a confident solution for long-term or permanent hair loss, or for women recovering from chemo who want a top-of-the line custom wig. John has spent forty years refining his creative and technical skills and his medical knowledge about hair loss in women to design hairpieces and wigs that are totally undetectable.
"I've dedicated my career to finding the best hair loss solutions. One of my specialties is a fine hairpiece like a strip of false eyelashes that attaches to the hair with micro-clips so there is no tension on the roots, just the illusion of fullness. I personalize these fillers and add rows of them as needed depending on the degree of loss and location. They also work effectively as "highlights" to bring depth of color and a tone-on-tone look to the hair, which also enhances the illusion of more hair. For a receding hairline I've developed a filler that tapes on, somewhat like a band-aid, to restore fullness there. And it's completely foolproof!" John D'Orazio is the name that hair loss doctors pass along to high profile clients."

"We all know about Frederic Fekkai and Oribe riding the crest of deserved hype as hairdressers to the famous, the celebrated, the social and the rich. Comes now John D'Orazio, formerly a top stylist at Suga, who has opened a salon on the Upper East Side where only a select few are privy.
"Located in a private town house mestled between Madison and Fifth on 72nd Street, the salon's watchword is 'discretion,' preferring to remain a best-kept secret that a group of high-profile women are hesitant to divulge.
"Can you think of a better way to get publicity? Anyhow, if you blink your eyes, you might miss such as Jackie Onassis, Nancy Reagan, Diane Von Furstenberg, Betsy Bloomingdale, Susan Anton and megamodel Stephanie Seymour slipping in for a fix."

"At the John D'Orazio Salon in New York City, owner John D'Orazio examined Teri's hair and asked what she wanted in a hairstyle. After Teri's hair was washed and conditioned, senior colorist Ingrid Urzua applied a new coloring technique called Moonlighting. The process adds depth, shine, and texture by using several darker, richer reds, yellows, and browns instead of lighter shades. Next, D'Orazio cut four inches from Teri's hair and reshaped it for a chic style that enhances her face instead of hiding it."
