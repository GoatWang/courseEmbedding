Privacy Policy


Last Updated May 6th, 2015
Beazer Homes’ Privacy Commitment.  Beazer Homes respects the privacy of our customers and protection of your personal information is important to us.  Beazer Homes believes in communicating clearly with our customers.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our policies with respect to information that Beazer Homes collects through the website at www.beazer.com ("Website"). By visiting the Website you are acknowledging that you have read, accept, and agree to the terms of this Policy.

Privacy Policy Support.  If you have an inquiry or concern about our Policy, please contact us using the contact information below.

Changes in this Policy.  Beazer Homes may amend this Policy at any time, but we will communicate with you, as required by law, when any changes are made. Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our Policy. This Policy replaces all previous notices or statements with respect to this subject, and cannot be modified orally by any of our representatives, employees or officers.

1. Information Beazer Homes Collects

                Beazer Homes and its Affiliates, as defined below, collect personal information for permissible business purposes to assist in meeting our customers’ needs. We do not require anyone to divulge any personally identifiable information to use the Website. Certain types of information available to you on the Website (for example, pricing information) may only be accessible after you provide us with requested personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes will not collect personal information about you through the Website unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.
                
                The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.
                
Personal Information.  We collect personal information about you for many reasons and at a variety of different times.  The type of personal information we collect depends on the community you’re looking at or live in, or the services you’ve requested.  Our computer servers automatically log your IP address, the pages you click on and how long you spend there, and the web page you came from and go to next; we also save the data you type in if you want us to send you brochures or applications.
                
                The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) first, middle, and last name; (ii) home or office phone and fax numbers; (iii) home or office address; (iv) home or office e-mail address; and (v) any other information you provide to us via our contact form.
                
                Beazer Homes also collects personal information for market research and product development so we can understand your needs as a home buyer.  We may also collect personal information about you from third- parties or other sources, such as information we receive from a credit reporting agency, information about your payment history, or the status of a loan application.
                
MCOT Program.  If you choose to participate in the Mortgage Choices On-Line Tool (MCOT), you may be asked to provide information such as your monthly income and debt levels.  Please visit our Financial Privacy Notice for the privacy terms governing the collection of financial information through MCOT, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our MCOT privacy policy differs in several important respects from this Policy.
                
Information Collected Through Technology.  Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, Beazer Homes collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides Beazer Homes with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit Beazer Homes to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. Beazer Homes uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful, including, in the following ways: (a) to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                
                Beazer Homes cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving the Website.  In addition to Beazer Homes cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Beazer Homes is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies.
                
                If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security.   However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Website and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.
                
Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13.  Beazer Homes does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
                If you are under the age of thirteen (13), we ask that you do not use the Website.  Beazer Homes does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Websites.  If we do learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Website from a minor and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account on the Website or has otherwise provided personally identifiable information, you may alert us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the Website.
            


2. How Beazer Homes Uses That Information

                Beazer Homes uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, we collect this personal information so we can provide you with the services you want, make it possible for you to build, buy and insure your home and help you settle into and enjoy your new home and your community.
                
                Beazer Homes may also contact you with information on promotional offers or incentives based on information you have provided. However, you may at any time "opt-out" by following the opt-out procedures below.
                
                We may also use your personal information as required by law, in response to governmental orders or requests, to enforce the Terms and Conditions applicable to the Website, and as we deem reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or take other appropriate measures in connection with fraudulent or illegal activities.
                
                Beazer Homes may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.
            


3. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information

                Beazer Homes uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure network encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
            


4. Information Sharing

Sharing of personal information between Affiliates.  Beazer Homes is made up of a number of companies (“Affiliates”).  Beazer Homes may share with and between its Affiliates personal information you provide to Beazer Homes or any of its Affiliates.
                
Non-Affiliates/Associates/Joint Marketing.  We also share personal information with our “Associates” - third parties that we have partnered with to share in the development or management of a community. Our Associates are third parties that are not affiliated with us and who perform services or functions on behalf of Beazer Homes or its Affiliates (such as accountants, attorneys, management companies, credit bureaus and banks).  They are required to hold the personal information we provide to them in confidence, and use the personal information only to provide the services we’ve hired them to perform for us or for you.  We may provide personal information about you to trusted companies pursuant to a written agreement with them when we jointly market our services to you.  An example of this would be if a company wanted to offer insurance services in your community.  The written agreement requires that they use your personal information only for the purposes of the joint marketing and that they not share it with others.
                
                We do not sell any customer lists that contain your personal information.
                
Other Circumstances.  We may disclose your personal information as you consent or direct. We may disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information in connection with a subpoena or other legal process, in an audit, or when we record your mortgage or deed in public records. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, or in the interest of national security, law enforcement activities, or other issues of health and safety as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
                
                We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
            


5. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices

                We give customers control over their personal information.
                
                We provide you with access to your personal information in various ways, including statements and community mailings, and want you to make sure that the personal information we have about you is accurate and current.  Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.



6. Questions or Comments

                If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us at: 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com.
            


7. Miscellaneous

Terms and Conditions.  This Policy is subject to, a part of, and incorporated into the Beazer Homes Terms and Conditions.
                
Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.  Beazer Homes has no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser should allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) are informed that you do not want to be tracked.
                
                If you end your customer relationship with us, this Policy will apply to personal information we collected while this Policy was in effect.
                This Policy does not apply to personal information relating to partnerships, trusts or corporations.
            



1000 Abernathy Road
Suite 260
Atlanta, GA 30328



Effective Date

This Policy is effective with respect to all data that we have collected since the date we commenced data collection, May 6th, 2015.

                The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.
                
Personal Information.  We collect personal information about you for many reasons and at a variety of different times.  The type of personal information we collect depends on the community you’re looking at or live in, or the services you’ve requested.  Our computer servers automatically log your IP address, the pages you click on and how long you spend there, and the web page you came from and go to next; we also save the data you type in if you want us to send you brochures or applications.
                
                The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) first, middle, and last name; (ii) home or office phone and fax numbers; (iii) home or office address; (iv) home or office e-mail address; and (v) any other information you provide to us via our contact form.
                
                Beazer Homes also collects personal information for market research and product development so we can understand your needs as a home buyer.  We may also collect personal information about you from third- parties or other sources, such as information we receive from a credit reporting agency, information about your payment history, or the status of a loan application.
                
MCOT Program.  If you choose to participate in the Mortgage Choices On-Line Tool (MCOT), you may be asked to provide information such as your monthly income and debt levels.  Please visit our Financial Privacy Notice for the privacy terms governing the collection of financial information through MCOT, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our MCOT privacy policy differs in several important respects from this Policy.
                
Information Collected Through Technology.  Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, Beazer Homes collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides Beazer Homes with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit Beazer Homes to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. Beazer Homes uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful, including, in the following ways: (a) to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                
                Beazer Homes cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving the Website.  In addition to Beazer Homes cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Beazer Homes is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies.
                
                If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security.   However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Website and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.
                
Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13.  Beazer Homes does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
                If you are under the age of thirteen (13), we ask that you do not use the Website.  Beazer Homes does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Websites.  If we do learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Website from a minor and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account on the Website or has otherwise provided personally identifiable information, you may alert us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the Website.
            


2. How Beazer Homes Uses That Information

                Beazer Homes uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, we collect this personal information so we can provide you with the services you want, make it possible for you to build, buy and insure your home and help you settle into and enjoy your new home and your community.
                
                Beazer Homes may also contact you with information on promotional offers or incentives based on information you have provided. However, you may at any time "opt-out" by following the opt-out procedures below.
                
                We may also use your personal information as required by law, in response to governmental orders or requests, to enforce the Terms and Conditions applicable to the Website, and as we deem reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or take other appropriate measures in connection with fraudulent or illegal activities.
                
                Beazer Homes may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.
            


3. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information

                Beazer Homes uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure network encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
            


4. Information Sharing

Sharing of personal information between Affiliates.  Beazer Homes is made up of a number of companies (“Affiliates”).  Beazer Homes may share with and between its Affiliates personal information you provide to Beazer Homes or any of its Affiliates.
                
Non-Affiliates/Associates/Joint Marketing.  We also share personal information with our “Associates” - third parties that we have partnered with to share in the development or management of a community. Our Associates are third parties that are not affiliated with us and who perform services or functions on behalf of Beazer Homes or its Affiliates (such as accountants, attorneys, management companies, credit bureaus and banks).  They are required to hold the personal information we provide to them in confidence, and use the personal information only to provide the services we’ve hired them to perform for us or for you.  We may provide personal information about you to trusted companies pursuant to a written agreement with them when we jointly market our services to you.  An example of this would be if a company wanted to offer insurance services in your community.  The written agreement requires that they use your personal information only for the purposes of the joint marketing and that they not share it with others.
                
                We do not sell any customer lists that contain your personal information.
                
Other Circumstances.  We may disclose your personal information as you consent or direct. We may disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information in connection with a subpoena or other legal process, in an audit, or when we record your mortgage or deed in public records. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, or in the interest of national security, law enforcement activities, or other issues of health and safety as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
                
                We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
            


5. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices

                We give customers control over their personal information.
                
                We provide you with access to your personal information in various ways, including statements and community mailings, and want you to make sure that the personal information we have about you is accurate and current.  Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.



6. Questions or Comments

                If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us at: 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com.
            


7. Miscellaneous

Terms and Conditions.  This Policy is subject to, a part of, and incorporated into the Beazer Homes Terms and Conditions.
                
Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.  Beazer Homes has no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser should allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) are informed that you do not want to be tracked.
                
                If you end your customer relationship with us, this Policy will apply to personal information we collected while this Policy was in effect.
                This Policy does not apply to personal information relating to partnerships, trusts or corporations.
            



1000 Abernathy Road
Suite 260
Atlanta, GA 30328



Effective Date

This Policy is effective with respect to all data that we have collected since the date we commenced data collection, May 6th, 2015.

Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.

Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.

Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser should allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) are informed that you do not want to be tracked.
                
                If you end your customer relationship with us, this Policy will apply to personal information we collected while this Policy was in effect.
                This Policy does not apply to personal information relating to partnerships, trusts or corporations.

Privacy Policy


Last Updated May 6th, 2015
Beazer Homes’ Privacy Commitment.  Beazer Homes respects the privacy of our customers and protection of your personal information is important to us.  Beazer Homes believes in communicating clearly with our customers.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our policies with respect to information that Beazer Homes collects through the website at www.beazer.com ("Website"). By visiting the Website you are acknowledging that you have read, accept, and agree to the terms of this Policy.

Privacy Policy Support.  If you have an inquiry or concern about our Policy, please contact us using the contact information below.

Changes in this Policy.  Beazer Homes may amend this Policy at any time, but we will communicate with you, as required by law, when any changes are made. Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our Policy. This Policy replaces all previous notices or statements with respect to this subject, and cannot be modified orally by any of our representatives, employees or officers.

1. Information Beazer Homes Collects

                Beazer Homes and its Affiliates, as defined below, collect personal information for permissible business purposes to assist in meeting our customers’ needs. We do not require anyone to divulge any personally identifiable information to use the Website. Certain types of information available to you on the Website (for example, pricing information) may only be accessible after you provide us with requested personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes will not collect personal information about you through the Website unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.
                
                The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.
                
Personal Information.  We collect personal information about you for many reasons and at a variety of different times.  The type of personal information we collect depends on the community you’re looking at or live in, or the services you’ve requested.  Our computer servers automatically log your IP address, the pages you click on and how long you spend there, and the web page you came from and go to next; we also save the data you type in if you want us to send you brochures or applications.
                
                The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) first, middle, and last name; (ii) home or office phone and fax numbers; (iii) home or office address; (iv) home or office e-mail address; and (v) any other information you provide to us via our contact form.
                
                Beazer Homes also collects personal information for market research and product development so we can understand your needs as a home buyer.  We may also collect personal information about you from third- parties or other sources, such as information we receive from a credit reporting agency, information about your payment history, or the status of a loan application.
                
MCOT Program.  If you choose to participate in the Mortgage Choices On-Line Tool (MCOT), you may be asked to provide information such as your monthly income and debt levels.  Please visit our Financial Privacy Notice for the privacy terms governing the collection of financial information through MCOT, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our MCOT privacy policy differs in several important respects from this Policy.
                
Information Collected Through Technology.  Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, Beazer Homes collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides Beazer Homes with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit Beazer Homes to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. Beazer Homes uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful, including, in the following ways: (a) to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                
                Beazer Homes cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving the Website.  In addition to Beazer Homes cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Beazer Homes is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies.
                
                If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security.   However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Website and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.
                
Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13.  Beazer Homes does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
                If you are under the age of thirteen (13), we ask that you do not use the Website.  Beazer Homes does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Websites.  If we do learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Website from a minor and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account on the Website or has otherwise provided personally identifiable information, you may alert us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the Website.
            


2. How Beazer Homes Uses That Information

                Beazer Homes uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, we collect this personal information so we can provide you with the services you want, make it possible for you to build, buy and insure your home and help you settle into and enjoy your new home and your community.
                
                Beazer Homes may also contact you with information on promotional offers or incentives based on information you have provided. However, you may at any time "opt-out" by following the opt-out procedures below.
                
                We may also use your personal information as required by law, in response to governmental orders or requests, to enforce the Terms and Conditions applicable to the Website, and as we deem reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or take other appropriate measures in connection with fraudulent or illegal activities.
                
                Beazer Homes may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.
            


3. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information

                Beazer Homes uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure network encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
            


4. Information Sharing

Sharing of personal information between Affiliates.  Beazer Homes is made up of a number of companies (“Affiliates”).  Beazer Homes may share with and between its Affiliates personal information you provide to Beazer Homes or any of its Affiliates.
                
Non-Affiliates/Associates/Joint Marketing.  We also share personal information with our “Associates” - third parties that we have partnered with to share in the development or management of a community. Our Associates are third parties that are not affiliated with us and who perform services or functions on behalf of Beazer Homes or its Affiliates (such as accountants, attorneys, management companies, credit bureaus and banks).  They are required to hold the personal information we provide to them in confidence, and use the personal information only to provide the services we’ve hired them to perform for us or for you.  We may provide personal information about you to trusted companies pursuant to a written agreement with them when we jointly market our services to you.  An example of this would be if a company wanted to offer insurance services in your community.  The written agreement requires that they use your personal information only for the purposes of the joint marketing and that they not share it with others.
                
                We do not sell any customer lists that contain your personal information.
                
Other Circumstances.  We may disclose your personal information as you consent or direct. We may disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information in connection with a subpoena or other legal process, in an audit, or when we record your mortgage or deed in public records. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, or in the interest of national security, law enforcement activities, or other issues of health and safety as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
                
                We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
            


5. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices

                We give customers control over their personal information.
                
                We provide you with access to your personal information in various ways, including statements and community mailings, and want you to make sure that the personal information we have about you is accurate and current.  Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.



6. Questions or Comments

                If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us at: 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com.
            


7. Miscellaneous

Terms and Conditions.  This Policy is subject to, a part of, and incorporated into the Beazer Homes Terms and Conditions.
                
Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.  Beazer Homes has no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.

Privacy Policy


Last Updated May 6th, 2015
Beazer Homes’ Privacy Commitment.  Beazer Homes respects the privacy of our customers and protection of your personal information is important to us.  Beazer Homes believes in communicating clearly with our customers.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our policies with respect to information that Beazer Homes collects through the website at www.beazer.com ("Website"). By visiting the Website you are acknowledging that you have read, accept, and agree to the terms of this Policy.

Privacy Policy Support.  If you have an inquiry or concern about our Policy, please contact us using the contact information below.

Changes in this Policy.  Beazer Homes may amend this Policy at any time, but we will communicate with you, as required by law, when any changes are made. Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our Policy. This Policy replaces all previous notices or statements with respect to this subject, and cannot be modified orally by any of our representatives, employees or officers.

1. Information Beazer Homes Collects

                Beazer Homes and its Affiliates, as defined below, collect personal information for permissible business purposes to assist in meeting our customers’ needs. We do not require anyone to divulge any personally identifiable information to use the Website. Certain types of information available to you on the Website (for example, pricing information) may only be accessible after you provide us with requested personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes will not collect personal information about you through the Website unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.
                
                The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.
                
Personal Information.  We collect personal information about you for many reasons and at a variety of different times.  The type of personal information we collect depends on the community you’re looking at or live in, or the services you’ve requested.  Our computer servers automatically log your IP address, the pages you click on and how long you spend there, and the web page you came from and go to next; we also save the data you type in if you want us to send you brochures or applications.
                
                The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) first, middle, and last name; (ii) home or office phone and fax numbers; (iii) home or office address; (iv) home or office e-mail address; and (v) any other information you provide to us via our contact form.
                
                Beazer Homes also collects personal information for market research and product development so we can understand your needs as a home buyer.  We may also collect personal information about you from third- parties or other sources, such as information we receive from a credit reporting agency, information about your payment history, or the status of a loan application.
                
MCOT Program.  If you choose to participate in the Mortgage Choices On-Line Tool (MCOT), you may be asked to provide information such as your monthly income and debt levels.  Please visit our Financial Privacy Notice for the privacy terms governing the collection of financial information through MCOT, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Our MCOT privacy policy differs in several important respects from this Policy.
                
Information Collected Through Technology.  Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, Beazer Homes collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides Beazer Homes with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit Beazer Homes to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. Beazer Homes uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful, including, in the following ways: (a) to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Website and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                
                Beazer Homes cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving the Website.  In addition to Beazer Homes cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Beazer Homes is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies.
                
                If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security.   However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Website and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.
                
Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13.  Beazer Homes does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.
                If you are under the age of thirteen (13), we ask that you do not use the Website.  Beazer Homes does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our Websites.  If we do learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Website from a minor and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account on the Website or has otherwise provided personally identifiable information, you may alert us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the Website.
            


2. How Beazer Homes Uses That Information

                Beazer Homes uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, we collect this personal information so we can provide you with the services you want, make it possible for you to build, buy and insure your home and help you settle into and enjoy your new home and your community.
                
                Beazer Homes may also contact you with information on promotional offers or incentives based on information you have provided. However, you may at any time "opt-out" by following the opt-out procedures below.
                
                We may also use your personal information as required by law, in response to governmental orders or requests, to enforce the Terms and Conditions applicable to the Website, and as we deem reasonably necessary to investigate, prevent or take other appropriate measures in connection with fraudulent or illegal activities.
                
                Beazer Homes may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.
            


3. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information

                Beazer Homes uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure network encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. Beazer Homes also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
            


4. Information Sharing

Sharing of personal information between Affiliates.  Beazer Homes is made up of a number of companies (“Affiliates”).  Beazer Homes may share with and between its Affiliates personal information you provide to Beazer Homes or any of its Affiliates.
                
Non-Affiliates/Associates/Joint Marketing.  We also share personal information with our “Associates” - third parties that we have partnered with to share in the development or management of a community. Our Associates are third parties that are not affiliated with us and who perform services or functions on behalf of Beazer Homes or its Affiliates (such as accountants, attorneys, management companies, credit bureaus and banks).  They are required to hold the personal information we provide to them in confidence, and use the personal information only to provide the services we’ve hired them to perform for us or for you.  We may provide personal information about you to trusted companies pursuant to a written agreement with them when we jointly market our services to you.  An example of this would be if a company wanted to offer insurance services in your community.  The written agreement requires that they use your personal information only for the purposes of the joint marketing and that they not share it with others.
                
                We do not sell any customer lists that contain your personal information.
                
Other Circumstances.  We may disclose your personal information as you consent or direct. We may disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information in connection with a subpoena or other legal process, in an audit, or when we record your mortgage or deed in public records. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, or in the interest of national security, law enforcement activities, or other issues of health and safety as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
                
                We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
            


5. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices

                We give customers control over their personal information.
                
                We provide you with access to your personal information in various ways, including statements and community mailings, and want you to make sure that the personal information we have about you is accurate and current.  Beazer Homes enables users of its Website to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services. You may do so by going to this opt-out link or by contacting us at 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.



6. Questions or Comments

                If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us at: 888-623-2937 or homeinfo@beazer.com.
            


7. Miscellaneous

Terms and Conditions.  This Policy is subject to, a part of, and incorporated into the Beazer Homes Terms and Conditions.
                
Changes and Updates to this Policy.  Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion.  If we modify this Policy, we will make it available through the Website, and indicate the date of the latest revision.  In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.  For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you sign-in to the Website for the first time after such material changes are made.  Our amended Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Website, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Policy, you may terminate your account.  Your continued use of the Website after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
                
International Users.  This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States.  By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow Beazer Homes to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Policy.
                
Third Party Links.  The Website may also contain links to other third party websites that are not under our control.  These websites may have their own policies or no policies at all, regarding privacy.  You should seek and review these policies before providing information to these websites.  Beazer Homes has no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. Beazer Homes also maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and fully complies with CAN-SPAM Act regulations.
                
Do Not Track.  Beazer Homes does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.  Therefore, Beazer Homes does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  Some third party sites, however, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser should allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) are informed that you do not want to be tracked.
                
                If you end your customer relationship with us, this Policy will apply to personal information we collected while this Policy was in effect.
                This Policy does not apply to personal information relating to partnerships, trusts or corporations.

Beazer Homes USA is an American homebuilding company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company builds and sells primarily single-family homes in twenty states of the continental United States. It also offers home mortgage services through its subsidiary, Beazer Mortgage Corporation. Beazer Homes USA was found guilty of mortgage fraud on a grand scale in the Subprime mortgage crisis and is credited with being a significant trigger of the Great Recession.

Formation of the business[edit]
The company was originally established when Beazer, a British house builder, made its first foray into the USA with the purchase of Cohn Communities, a small Atlanta-based housebuilder. After buying two more US-based house building companies, the US operation was renamed Beazer Homes USA.[1]
2007 investigations and litigation[edit]
In March 2007, Beazer received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina seeking documents related to its mortgage origination services. Media reports have indicated that the company is under federal investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, a charge the company denies. Beazer has said the U.S. Attorney's Office has "made no allegations of wrongdoing by Beazer Homes at this time and that the statements made by a Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesperson about the fact of an investigation and the scope of the investigation were unauthorized, and should not have been made".[2]
Beazer reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on May 3, 2007, that the SEC has launched an informal investigation of the company. The company said that the inquiry will determine whether any person or entity related to Beazer Homes has violated federal securities laws.[3]
On July 4, 2007, it was reported that a lawsuit has been filed by 10 homebuyers against Beazer Homes USA, Beazer Mortgage Corporation, and a Beazer sales agent, Roderick D. Williams, in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The lawsuit alleges that fraudulent tactics were so pervasive in a Beazer Homes housing development in Charlotte that corporate management must have participated or condoned the approach, according to a lawsuit filed against the Atlanta-based company. "This is an abuse-of-trust case", said Charlotte lawyer Ken Davies, whose firm represents the plaintiffs, most of whom bought their first homes in Beazer's Oak Hill development. "Our clients all say, 'I should never have bought this house, but I was told I could afford it and I could qualify for a loan...' They had a right to rely on the professionals to guide them appropriately". The homebuyers are seeking compensation for homebuyers' losses and punitive damages from Beazer. An analysis by The Charlotte Observer shows that at least 14 of 140 homes in Oak Hill have fallen into foreclosure, a 10 percent foreclosure rate. Nationally, less than 3 percent of home purchases end in foreclosure. The newspaper's analysis also found that 10 of Beazer's subdivisions in Charlotte had rates of 20 percent or higher. The lawsuit said that the sales agent falsified documents to help buyers get loans for Beazer homes. Among the allegations are that assets and debts were misrepresented on loan applications and important information concealed. The lawsuit says one buyer lost her home in foreclosure and another filed for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, property values have declined because of the foreclosures, the lawsuit says. At least three other homeowner lawsuits—two in the Charlotte area—target Beazer's sales and mortgage practices.[4]
On July 23, 2007, Beazer Homes USA Inc. reported that it received a formal order of private investigation issued by the SEC on July 20, 2007. Beazer was placed under an informal investigation in May 2007.[5]
Federal settlement[edit]
On October 30, 2007, six home builders, including Beazer Homes USA, agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle federal allegations that they illegally established title insurance companies that took payments for a portion of the insurance risk. Under the settlement announced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Beazer Homes, TOUSA, Pulte Homes, KB Home, Meritage Homes, and Ryland Homes denied any wrongdoing, but said they settled the civil cases to avoid legal expenses. The companies agreed to six separate settlements. Beazer Homes and its captive title reinsurance company Security Title Insurance Co. agreed to pay a $261,000 settlement. HUD alleged that the builders were illegally using their own "captive" title insurance companies to receive payments for a portion of the insurance risk, when no such arrangement is necessary in the single-family home market.[6]
2009 investigations and litigation[edit]
On July 1, 2009, Beazer Homes USA, Inc reaches $50 million settlement of Mortgage and Accounting Fraud with United States. As described more fully in the bill of information, Beazer and its subsidiary, Beazer Mortgage Corporation, admit to engaging in several fraudulent mortgage origination practices, including:

Retaining so-called “discount points” that should have been used to provide some homebuyers with a decreased interest rate
Misinforming some home-buyers that they were receiving a “gift” from a charity to cover their down payment when, in truth, the price of the home was increased to offset the supposed “gift"
Circumventing HUD's “Neighborhood Watch” and “Credit Watch” programs to avoid HUD action in response to the high foreclosure rate of some Beazer Mortgage offices
Instituting a strategy of willful blindness with regard to some stated income loans[7]

HUD alleged that the builders were illegally using their own "captive" title insurance companies to receive payments for a portion of the insurance risk, when no such arrangement is necessary in the single-family home market.[6]
2009 investigations and litigation[edit]
On July 1, 2009, Beazer Homes USA, Inc reaches $50 million settlement of Mortgage and Accounting Fraud with United States. As described more fully in the bill of information, Beazer and its subsidiary, Beazer Mortgage Corporation, admit to engaging in several fraudulent mortgage origination practices, including:

Retaining so-called “discount points” that should have been used to provide some homebuyers with a decreased interest rate
Misinforming some home-buyers that they were receiving a “gift” from a charity to cover their down payment when, in truth, the price of the home was increased to offset the supposed “gift"
Circumventing HUD's “Neighborhood Watch” and “Credit Watch” programs to avoid HUD action in response to the high foreclosure rate of some Beazer Mortgage offices
Instituting a strategy of willful blindness with regard to some stated income loans[7]

Beazer Homes USA is an American homebuilding company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company builds and sells primarily single-family homes in twenty states of the continental United States. It also offers home mortgage services through its subsidiary, Beazer Mortgage Corporation. Beazer Homes USA was found guilty of mortgage fraud on a grand scale in the Subprime mortgage crisis and is credited with being a significant trigger of the Great Recession.

Formation of the business[edit]
The company was originally established when Beazer, a British house builder, made its first foray into the USA with the purchase of Cohn Communities, a small Atlanta-based housebuilder. After buying two more US-based house building companies, the US operation was renamed Beazer Homes USA.[1]
2007 investigations and litigation[edit]
In March 2007, Beazer received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina seeking documents related to its mortgage origination services. Media reports have indicated that the company is under federal investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, a charge the company denies. Beazer has said the U.S. Attorney's Office has "made no allegations of wrongdoing by Beazer Homes at this time and that the statements made by a Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesperson about the fact of an investigation and the scope of the investigation were unauthorized, and should not have been made".[2]
Beazer reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on May 3, 2007, that the SEC has launched an informal investigation of the company. The company said that the inquiry will determine whether any person or entity related to Beazer Homes has violated federal securities laws.[3]
On July 4, 2007, it was reported that a lawsuit has been filed by 10 homebuyers against Beazer Homes USA, Beazer Mortgage Corporation, and a Beazer sales agent, Roderick D. Williams, in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The lawsuit alleges that fraudulent tactics were so pervasive in a Beazer Homes housing development in Charlotte that corporate management must have participated or condoned the approach, according to a lawsuit filed against the Atlanta-based company. "This is an abuse-of-trust case", said Charlotte lawyer Ken Davies, whose firm represents the plaintiffs, most of whom bought their first homes in Beazer's Oak Hill development. "Our clients all say, 'I should never have bought this house, but I was told I could afford it and I could qualify for a loan...' They had a right to rely on the professionals to guide them appropriately". The homebuyers are seeking compensation for homebuyers' losses and punitive damages from Beazer. An analysis by The Charlotte Observer shows that at least 14 of 140 homes in Oak Hill have fallen into foreclosure, a 10 percent foreclosure rate. Nationally, less than 3 percent of home purchases end in foreclosure. The newspaper's analysis also found that 10 of Beazer's subdivisions in Charlotte had rates of 20 percent or higher. The lawsuit said that the sales agent falsified documents to help buyers get loans for Beazer homes. Among the allegations are that assets and debts were misrepresented on loan applications and important information concealed. The lawsuit says one buyer lost her home in foreclosure and another filed for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, property values have declined because of the foreclosures, the lawsuit says. At least three other homeowner lawsuits—two in the Charlotte area—target Beazer's sales and mortgage practices.[4]
On July 23, 2007, Beazer Homes USA Inc. reported that it received a formal order of private investigation issued by the SEC on July 20, 2007. Beazer was placed under an informal investigation in May 2007.[5]
Federal settlement[edit]
On October 30, 2007, six home builders, including Beazer Homes USA, agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle federal allegations that they illegally established title insurance companies that took payments for a portion of the insurance risk. Under the settlement announced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Beazer Homes, TOUSA, Pulte Homes, KB Home, Meritage Homes, and Ryland Homes denied any wrongdoing, but said they settled the civil cases to avoid legal expenses. The companies agreed to six separate settlements. Beazer Homes and its captive title reinsurance company Security Title Insurance Co. agreed to pay a $261,000 settlement. HUD alleged that the builders were illegally using their own "captive" title insurance companies to receive payments for a portion of the insurance risk, when no such arrangement is necessary in the single-family home market.[6]
2009 investigations and litigation[edit]
On July 1, 2009, Beazer Homes USA, Inc reaches $50 million settlement of Mortgage and Accounting Fraud with United States. As described more fully in the bill of information, Beazer and its subsidiary, Beazer Mortgage Corporation, admit to engaging in several fraudulent mortgage origination practices, including:

Retaining so-called “discount points” that should have been used to provide some homebuyers with a decreased interest rate
Misinforming some home-buyers that they were receiving a “gift” from a charity to cover their down payment when, in truth, the price of the home was increased to offset the supposed “gift"
Circumventing HUD's “Neighborhood Watch” and “Credit Watch” programs to avoid HUD action in response to the high foreclosure rate of some Beazer Mortgage offices
Instituting a strategy of willful blindness with regard to some stated income loans[7]

Style Scores:



A Value | A Growth | D Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
