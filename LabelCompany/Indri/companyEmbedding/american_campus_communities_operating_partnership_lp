	SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL GENERAL RELEASE



	This SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL GENERAL RELEASE (this 

	Agreement

	) dated as of January 10, 2017 is by and between
	Jonathan A. Graf (

	Executive

	) and American Campus Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the 

	Company

	).


	WHEREAS, the Company and Executive have entered into an Employment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2007, as amended
	(

	Employment Agreement

	);


	WHEREAS, Executive shall resign as an officer of the Company and all entities related to the
	Company, and also resign as an officer, director, manager or similar functionary of all entities related to the Company, effective as of March 31, 2017 (the 

	Initial Termination Date

	);


	WHEREAS, Executive shall resign as an employee of the Company and all entities related to the Company effective as of June 30, 2017 (the
	

	Final Termination Date

	); and


	WHEREAS, Executive and the Company have agreed to provide each other with a general
	release of claims as contained herein and in the Supplemental Mutual General Release Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the 

	Supplemental Release

	).


	NOW, THEREFORE, Executive and the Company agree to enter into this Agreement setting forth their respective obligations related to
	Executives separation as follows:


	1.

	Resignation

	. Effective as of the Initial Termination Date, Executive resigns as an
	officer of the Company and all entities related to the Company, and as an officer, director, manager or similar functionary of all entities related to the Company. Effective as the Final Termination Date, Executive resigns as an employee of the
	Company and all entities related to the Company. The Company and Executive hereby waive any rights to prior notification of the separation of Executives employment.


	2.

	Special Compensation and Benefits

	.


	(a) The Company will pay to executive an Annual Bonus for 2016 equal to $575,000 on or before February 3, 2017.


	(b) The Company will pay to Executive the Accrued Obligations within five business days of the Final Termination Date. Executive agrees that
	upon satisfaction of the obligation set forth in Section 2(a), there is no unpaid Annual Bonus owed to him in respect to any fiscal year.


	(c) The Company will pay to Executive an amount equal to $2,138,467, less applicable withholding and deductions, in a lump sum payment within
	five business days of the effective date of the Supplemental Release (the 

	Separation Payment

	).


	(d) Executive shall
	retain all of the restricted stock awards, common units and other stock-based awards previously granted to Executive under the Plan or otherwise that have vested as of the Final Termination Date. As of the effective date of the Supplemental Release,
	any and all portions of any restricted stock awards or other stock-based awards unvested as of the






	Final Termination Date previously granted to Executive under the Plan or otherwise shall vest and become non-forfeitable. With respect to all common units held by Executive, Executive shall have
	all rights as all other common unitholders under the Limited Partnership Agreement of American Campus Communities Operating Partnership LP and, with respect to such restricted stock and other stock-based awards, Executive shall have all rights set

	(e) From and after the effective date of the
	Supplemental Release Executive shall remain on the Companys then-in-effect health, vision and dental benefit plans (with family coverage) through and including December 31, 2019; provided, that if prior to such date, Executive is eligible
	to receive health insurance benefits from a subsequent employer, benefits under this Section 2(e) shall cease as of the date Executive becomes so eligible. Executive acknowledges and agrees that as a result of the foregoing, he will have no
	right to COBRA benefits under any of the Companys health benefit plans.


	(f) As of the Initial Termination Date, neither the Company
	nor any of its affiliates shall have any obligation to Executive arising out of the Employment Agreement.


	(g) On the Final Termination
	Date, Executive and the Company shall sign and deliver to the other the Supplemental Release. Should Executive or the Company fail to sign and deliver the Supplemental Release on the Final Termination Date, he or it shall be deemed to have willfully
	breached a material provision of this Agreement. In the event of a breach of this Section 2(g), the non-breaching party shall be entitled to an order of specific performance from a court of competent jurisdiction requiring the breaching party
	to sign and deliver the Supplemental Release to the other and the breaching party hereby consents to the entry of such an order.

	Termination Date, Executive will cease to have any responsibility as an officer of the Company or any of its affiliates and cease to have day-to-day responsibility for running any business division of the Company. The parties agree none of the
	actions described in this Section 2(i) will be deemed to be a breach of the Employment Agreement (or entitle the Company to terminate Executives employment for Cause or entitle Executive to terminate his employment for Good Reason) or
	this Agreement.

	General Release by Executive

	. In return for the special compensation and benefits
	referenced in this Agreement, Executive agrees to the following:


	(a) Executive agrees, on behalf of himself and all of his heirs or
	personal representatives, to release the Company and all of its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors and successors, and all of their present or former officers, directors, managers, representatives, employees, agents, employee benefit programs,
	and the trustees, administrators, fiduciaries and insurers of such programs (collectively, the 

	Company Released Parties

	), from any and all claims for relief of any kind, whether known to Executive or unknown, which in any way
	arise out of or relate to Executives employment at the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, the separation of his employment at the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, any agreements between the Company or
	any of the other Company Released Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment Agreement, and concerning any facts or events occurring at any time up to the Effective Date (as defined in Section 4(l) below), including, but
	not limited to, any and all claims of discrimination, retaliation or wrongful discharge of any kind, and any contractual, tort or other common law claims. This settlement and waiver includes all such claims, whether for breach of contract,
	quasi-contract, implied contract,

	quantum meruit

	, unjust enrichment, compensation, deferred compensation, equity interest, any tort claims, including without limitation fraud and misrepresentation, and any and all claims under any applicable
	federal laws, including, but not limited to, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the Americans with Disabilities Act, as

	any facts or events occurring at any time up to the Effective Date, or to participate voluntarily in any employment-related claim brought by any other party against the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties. Even if a court rules that
	Executive may file a lawsuit against the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties arising from Executives employment at the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, the separation thereof, or any facts or events
	occurring at any time up to the Effective Date, Executive agrees not to accept any money damages or any other relief in connection with any such lawsuit. Executive understands that this Agreement effectively waives any right he might have to sue the
	Company or any of the other Company Released Parties for any claim arising out of Executives employment at the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, any agreements between the Company or any of the other Company Released
	Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment Agreement, or the separation of Executives employment. However, Executive recognizes and understands that this release does not prohibit him from filing an administrative
	charge with any state or federal agency.

	addition, this release does not give up Executives rights, if any, to COBRA benefits under the Companys standard benefit programs applicable to Executive. Further, this release does not waive Executives rights to vested equity
	interests, vested 401(k) or pension monies or Executives rights to indemnification under the Companys charter or bylaws or the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2007, between Executive and the Company.


	(b)

	General Release by the Company

	. Except as set forth in the last paragraph of this Section 3, the Company agrees, on behalf of
	itself and all of its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors and successors, to release Executive and his heirs (collectively, the 

	), from any and all claims for relief of any kind,
	whether known to it or unknown, which in any way arise out of or relate to Executives employment at the Company any of the other Company Released Parties, the separation of Executives employment at the Company or any of the other Company
	Released Parties, or any agreements between the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment Agreement, and concerning any facts or events occurring at any time up to the Effective
	Date. This settlement and waiver includes all claims, whether for breach of contract, quasi-contract, implied contract,

	quantum meruit

	, unjust enrichment, any tort claims, including without limitation misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary
	duty, and any and all claims under any applicable law.

	Company Released Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment Agreement, or to participate voluntarily in any employment-related claim brought by any other party against Executive or any of the other Executive Released Parties.
	Except as set forth in the last paragraph of this Section 3, even if a court rules that the Company may file a lawsuit against Executive or any of the other Executive Released Parties arising from Executives employment at the Company or
	any of the other Company Released Parties, or the separation thereof, the Company agrees not to accept any money damages or any other relief in connection with any such lawsuit. The Company understands that this Agreement effectively waives any
	right it might have to sue Executive or any of the other Executive Released Parties for any claim arising out of Executives employment at the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, any agreements between the Company or the other
	Company Released Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment Agreement, the separation of Executives employment, or any facts or events occurring at any time up to the Effective Date, except as set forth in the last
	paragraph of this Section 3.


	Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall release the Executive
	or the other Executive Released Parties from any claim relating to (i) a breach by Executive of any provision of any agreement that survives the execution hereof, including but not limited to the Noncompete Agreement, (ii) Executives

	American Campus Communities Announces a Series of Executive Promotions and Upcoming Retirement of CFO



	AUSTIN, Texas, January 10, 2017

	American Campus Communities

	(NYSE: ACC), the nations largest owner, manager and developer of
	high-quality student housing properties in the U.S., today announced it is advancing its succession plan with a series of internal promotions to ensure the company is fully exploiting the breadth of executive talent available to further advance the
	companys long term strategic business plan and to facilitate orderly executive succession well into the next decade.


	Effective immediately, the
	company is separating the roles of President and Chief Executive Officer, with Bill Bayless remaining as CEO and Jim Hopke, Chief Operating Officer, being promoted to the position of President. In this role, Jim will continue to report directly to
	the CEO and provide executive oversight of day-to-day business operations, advance the companys asset and portfolio management functions, and focus on furthering American Campus best in class operating platform including strategic
	oversight of the companys next gen systems development working closely with Chief Technology Officer Jorge de Cardenas.


	Also effective immediately,
	Jennifer Beese, Executive Vice President of Operations, Marketing, and Leasing is being promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer and will continue to report directly to Mr. Hopke. Ms. Beese will continue to provide executive
	oversight of marketing, leasing and property operations, and functional support services. She will also assume executive responsibility for human resources, corporate administration and company culture. Hopke and Beese have a combined 30 plus years
	with the company and have been leading its operations since 2014.


	In addition, Jon Graf will step down as Chief Financial Officer on March 31, 2017
	and will be retiring from the company on June 30, 2017. Graf has been an integral part of the executive team, having joined the company in conjunction with its IPO in 2004; initially serving as Corporate Controller, being promoted to Chief
	Accounting Officer in 2005, and ultimately serving as Chief Financial Officer since 2007. He led the companys financial operations through periods of substantial growth during which American Campus came to be recognized as the industrys
	best in class company. He will continue to work closely with his successors in the finance and accounting departments during the upcoming transition period.


	Daniel Perry, EVP of Corporate Finance & Capital Markets, who for years has been the companys lead executive interacting with investors,
	analysts and the banking community will be promoted to Chief Financial Officer, effective March 31, 2017. Perry joined the company in 2005 from Citigroup where he had worked on the companys IPO.


	Effective immediately, Kim Voss, EVP and Controller, who joined the company in 2004 from AMB, is being promoted to the position of Chief Accounting Officer
	reporting directly to the CFO. Voss has provided executive oversight of the companys corporate accounting, property accounting and public company reporting since her promotion to EVP in May of 2015.








	On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, Id like to recognize and thank Jon Graf for more
	than a decade of service to American Campus and wish him well in his retirement from the company, said Ed Lowenthal, Independent Chairman of the Board. For nearly a decade, the Board has been working hand in hand with Bill on executive
	development and succession planning. These promotions represent a milestone related to that work and set the stage for smooth executive succession in the decades ahead

	.



	It is very exciting to see each one of these talented executives continue to advance their careers with American Campus, said Bill Bayless, CEO.
	Jim and I look forward to fully developing the next generation of executives that will lead this company for decades to come. Jennifer, Daniel and Kim, along with William Talbot, our Chief Investment Officer, have been impact players
	throughout their careers at American Campus and I am confident they will make even greater contributions at the next levels of executive leadership. Its truly an honor for me to continue to lead the industrys most talented group of
	executives as CEO.

	current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which American Campus operates, managements beliefs, and assumptions made by management. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and

Executive agrees, on behalf of himself and all of his heirs or
personal representatives, to release the Company and all of its
subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors and successors, and all of
their present or former officers, directors, managers,
representatives, employees, agents, employee benefit programs, and
the trustees, administrators, fiduciaries and insurers of such

”), from any and all claims for relief of any kind, whether
known to Executive or unknown, which in any way arise out of or
relate to Executive’s employment at the Company or any of the
other Company Released Parties, the separation of his employment at
the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, any
agreements between the Company or any of the other Company Released
Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment
Agreement, and concerning any facts or events occurring at any time
up to the Effective Date (as defined in Section 4(l) below),
including, but not limited to, any and all claims of
discrimination, retaliation or wrongful discharge of any kind, and
any contractual, tort or other common law claims. This settlement
and waiver includes all such claims, whether for breach of
contract, quasi-contract, implied contract, quantum meruit ,
unjust enrichment, compensation, deferred compensation, equity
interest, any tort claims, including without limitation fraud and
misrepresentation, and any and all claims under any applicable
federal laws, including, but not limited to, the Age Discrimination

including but not limited to the Employment Agreement, or any facts
or events occurring at any time up to the Effective Date, or to
participate voluntarily in any employment-related claim brought by
any other party against the Company or any of the other Company
Released Parties. Even if a court rules that Executive may file a
lawsuit against the Company or any of the other Company Released
Parties arising from Executive’s employment at the Company or
any of the other Company Released Parties, the separation thereof,
or any facts or events occurring at any time up to the Effective
Date, Executive agrees not to accept any money damages or any other
relief in connection with any such lawsuit. Executive understands
that this Agreement effectively waives any right he might have to
sue the Company or any of the other Company Released Parties for
any claim arising out of Executive’s employment at the
Company or any of the other Company Released Parties, any
agreements between the Company or any of the other Company Released
Parties and Executive, including but not limited to the Employment
Agreement, or the separation of Executive’s employment.
However, Executive recognizes and understands that this release
does not prohibit him from filing an administrative charge with any
state or federal agency.

dated as of November 1, 2007, between Executive and the

last paragraph of this Section 3, the Company agrees, on
behalf of itself and all of its parent companies, subsidiaries,
