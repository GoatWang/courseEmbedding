Introducing:  Abita Beer in Cans

		  Louisiana's Premier Craft Beer "Yes, We Can!"
		

Jul 25, 2011, 10:15 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Abita Brewing Company 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW ORLEANS, July 25, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The Abita Brewing Company is pleased to announce it plans to offer three of its flagship brews in cans:  Amber, Purple Haze and Jockamo I.P.A.
Abita Brewing Company President David Blossman said, "We feel confident that today's cans are a quality solution that will preserve and protect the flavor of Abita.  For many years people associated craft beer with glass bottles, but the perception and the technology of the aluminum beverage can has changed."
The new Abita cans will be coated with a special water-based lining to protect and preserve the great taste of the beer.  This lining insulates the beer from the can's interior surface.  Canning also limits exposure to UV light and oxygen, two elements that can damage the taste of beer.
"You can take cans to places where glass might not be convenient or allowed...parades, fishing, tubing, golfing or the beach," said Blossman.  "We've made it even easier to bring Abita to the party, wherever it's happening."  
Cans are easy to recycle, weigh less to ship and the average new beer can is made of 40% recycled aluminum.  "Abita is committed to a greener environment.  We conserve energy and water, create our own bio-gas and drive greener vehicles.  We use recycled content in our bottles and packaging.  Aluminum cans are one more way Abita is working to keep our part of the world green and clean."
Abita will offer the canned product in six and 12 packs and expect it to reach store shelves early in 2012.  The canning will be based at the brewery in Abita Springs.  Abita will continue packaging in glass just as they have since they began brewing in 1986.
The Abita Brewing Company was founded in Abita Springs, Louisiana and is the oldest and largest craft brewer in the southeast. Abita is the 30th largest commercial brewer by production volume in the nation and the 17th largest craft brewer in the United States.  Sales for the company should exceed 130,000 barrels this year. 
Abita Brewing Company produces seven flagship brews:  Abita Amber, Golden, Light, Turbodog, Purple Haze, Jockamo I.P.A. and Restoration Pale Ale.  Abita also offers five seasonal beers, three Harvest brews, three Big Beers and a draft-only series of Select beers.
