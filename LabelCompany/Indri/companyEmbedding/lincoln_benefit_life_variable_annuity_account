Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

 Annuities

	Enjoy your retirement





A good retirement income plan should generate two to three decades of sustainable income. It can help protect your assets from inflation, market volatility and savings withdrawal rates.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is an insurance product designed for retirement to help protect your financial future and guard against outliving your savings. An annuity pays you periodic income payments for as long as you live in exchange for a premium and it’s designed to be part of an overall retirement strategy. Annuity types offer different features and payment options to help meet your needs and priorities. Compare your options.
Annuities offer many additional benefits to help you prepare for the future, such as:  

No annual contribution limit
Ability to diversify and potentially grow your investments
Tax-deferred investment income until it’s withdrawn
Death benefit protection for beneficiaries
Optional riders (for an additional cost). Review our rider options.

To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated.
If you have questions or for more information on annuities, contact an advisor. 
Tax considerations
Annuities allow money to grow tax-deferred until clients begin taking payments. While consumers can’t control state and federal tax rates or policies they can take steps to help protect savings and income from tax erosion, and improve spending power in retirement. 

Find out why tax planning for retirement is so important.

What type is right for me?



The two main types of annuities are fixed and variable. While both options provide guaranteed income in retirement, they each offer different features and benefits.
Fixed annuities
With a fixed annuity, premiums go toward predictable returns, growth potential and the possibility of a lifetime income stream. 
We offer three types of fixed annuities:

Fixed annuities offer a predictable return. 
Fixed indexed annuities offer growth potential and a living benefit.
Income annuities provide current and future income.

Variable annuities
A variable annuity is a flexible income solution designed for retirement that provides a guaranteed lifetime income stream. Consumers can also capture growth potential over time through the performance of underlying investment options.
To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated. All guarantees, including those for optional features, are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuer. Limitations and conditions apply.

Investors are advised to consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. The applicable variable annuity prospectuses contains this and other important information about the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. Please call 888-868-2583 for a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money. Products and features are subject to state availability.
 
A fixed annuity is intended for retirement or other long-term needs. It is intended for a person who has sufficient cash or other liquid assets for living expenses and other unexpected emergencies, such as medical expenses. A fixed indexed annuity is not a registered security or stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investments, or index. The index used is a price index and does not reflect dividends paid on the underlying stocks.

Lincoln Benefit Life









Lincoln Benefit Life Company is a specialized firm under Allstate Insurance.  The company offers a wide range of products and services including annuities.  By the end of 2008, the company protected its policy owners with $344.3 billion of life insurance in-force.  The company has been in business since 1938.  Annuity-based products include fixed annuities, variable annuities, market value adjusted annuities, equity indexed annuities and immediate annuities.  Descriptions of these product categories are as follows:  1) Fixed Annuities: Fixed annuities offer a guarantee of principal and interest.  Contributions earn a stated interest rate for a specified period of time while earnings grow tax deferred.  Fixed annuities are for conservative investors.  2) Variable Annuities: Variable annuities offer single or flexible premiums, a broad range of subaccounts, tax deferral on earnings, and a death benefit.  Values change according to the performance of the selected subaccounts.  Generally, variable annuities have higher expenses than a fixed annuity.  Variable annuities are long term investments designed for retirement purposes and are best suited for investors willing to tolerate risk.  3) Market Value Adjusted Annuities (MVAs): MVAs offer fixed interest rates combined with an interest rate adjustment factor that can cause the actual crediting rates to increase or decrease in response to current market conditions at the time of withdrawal.  MVAs are appropriate for individuals who are willing to tolerate minimal risk for a higher initial credited interest rate.  4) Equity Indexed Annuities Equity indexed annuities present interest based on the upward movement of an equity index, but still maintain the minimum guaranteed interest rate feature of a traditional fixed annuity.  Equity indexed annuities are for individuals who are moderate risk takers.

Lincoln Benefit Life 
Resolution Life has completed the process of acquiring Lincoln Benefit Life Company (“LBL”) from Allstate Life Insurance Company. Ownership of LBL was transferred on April 1, 2014 to Resolution Life after approval was received from the Nebraska Department of Insurance.
Insurance policies and contracts sold by LBL through the independent brokerage channel will remain fully supported by LBL. Those policies and contracts sold through the Allstate Financial agency system will be reinsured to and supported by Allstate Life Insurance Company. In 2006, the variable annuity contracts sold by LBL were reinsured by Prudential Life Insurance Company of America and will continue to be supported by Prudential. More information regarding the regulatory approval process may be found on the following website: Nebraska Department of Insurance.
For more information on Lincoln Benefit Life, see the Frequently Asked Questions.
Policyholders
What does this mean for policyholders?
For the majority of policyholders, very little will change. Policies will continue to be held with LBL and policies that are re-insured back to Prudential or Allstate will be serviced by Prudential or Allstate.
Resolution Life and Allstate Life Insurance Company have agreed to a Transitional Agreement whereby Allstate will continue to provide service to the policyholders for 12-to-18 months. After the transition period, policy service and administration will be provided by industry-leading third-party administrators under the direction of LBL’s management. Before any changes are made, LBL will write to brokers and policyholders.
Will policies be safe?
LBL will continue to be regulated by the Nebraska Department of Insurance. Resolution Life is committed to serving its policyholders and their families with dependable, high-quality service and will comply with all regulatory requirements, such as capital requirements and investment restrictions. LBL will continue to be covered by the same financial guarantee associations as prior to the acquisition.
Will policyholders continue to have privacy protection?
LBL is a U.S.-domiciled insurer and, as such, U.S. privacy laws continue to apply to it. Privacy is very important to Resolution Life and it will maintain safeguards to ensure the privacy of its policyholders.
Will we have a facility to contact? Will we be able to get access to information to service?
Yes, there will be no changes in this regard. LBL will retain its existing name while its parent company will become Resolution Life. The current telephone numbers will also remain the same. If these should change in the future, all agents and policyholders will be advised of the new number.
 
Policyholder Service
Where will in-force business be serviced?
Allstate Life Insurance Company will continue to service in-force LBL business sold through the independent brokerage channel using its current operations in Lincoln and Chicago during the 12-to-18 month transition period when administration is transitioned to Resolution Life.
After this transition period, LBL will provide a similar service through its chosen third-party policyholder service administrator. Resolution Life has committed that much of this will be delivered from Nebraska.
Will we have access to in-force forms and what kind of support will be provided?
You will have online access to forms, as well as be able to contact us by phone and mail during the period when Allstate transitions business to Resolution Life. LBL will provide the same service after the transition period, but  access will be provided via an LBL website rather than via accessallstate.com.
 
Brokers
What does this mean for Independent Brokers?
While brokers will no longer be able to sell LBL products, existing policyholders who purchased policies through the independent brokerage channel will continue to receive the high quality of service to which they are accustomed. As a servicing agent, you can continue to look after your clients’ needs. In addition, current commission arrangements will remain in place.
Will I still be able to access current accounts?
Selling agencies will remain the agent of record and their organizations will continue to have access to policyholder information in the same way they have access today. You will remain a servicing agent for the lifetime of the policies.
What changes can I expect?
During the transitional period, we expect it to be very much business as usual. As we move to our chosen third-party administrator, there may be some changes regarding contact numbers. We will inform you of that change when we have confirmed it.
Will brokers continue to receive the same renewal and commission fees? Will their contracts be the same as they are today?
There will be no change to the renewal commissions. While brokers will no longer be able to sell LBL products, all contractual terms will remain the same.
 
Regulatory
Will LBL be governed by state insurance rules? Will its primary regulator still be the Nebraska Department of Insurance?
LBL is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to regulation by the Nebraska Department of Insurance. Resolution Life has no intention to re-domesticate LBL to another state. Even though LBL will no longer be selling new policies, LBL intends to maintain its licenses in all states in which it is currently licensed. As a licensed company, LBL will be considered an admitted insurer.
Regulatory approval is required for Resolution Life’s acquisition of LBL. Resolution Life is working with Allstate Life Insurance Company and the Nebraska Department of Insurance and expects the transaction to close following customary regulatory approval.
 
General
Where are Resolution Life’s U.S. offices located?
Resolution Life will have offices in Chicago, IL, Lincoln, NE and Stamford, CT.
Why was Resolution Life chosen to acquire LBL?
When Allstate made the decision to sell LBL, they looked for buyers that demonstrated the following critical criteria: established quality of service, integrity and financial strength, a fair price and demonstrated willingness to work with Allstate during a transition period to ensure there was no gap in product availability for Allstate policyholders. Resolution Life met those criteria.
Please refer to the About Us sections of Resolutionlife.com for further background on Resolution Life.
What is the financial strength of Resolution Life?
Resolution Life has established a permanent capital structure that aligns its long-term commitment to the U.S. market with the investment horizon of its leading institutional investors and the duration of underlying life insurance policies. The company is supported by significant investor commitments.
Lincoln Benefit Life’s capitalization level is subject to regulatory approvals. Resolution Life has engaged in a rating process with at least one major rating agency.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

11 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































11 Tips You Absolutely Must Know About Annuities  




Tip #4: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation. 





Get My Annuity Report Now!


2017's Best Annuities - Find the annuities with the highest rates, lowest fees and highest guaranteed returns in our free report




Tip #10: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. The rates for CD-type annuities remain the same for the term. 







Tip #3: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund”, the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.  Annuities avoid probate, so select the right beneficiary!




Tip #5:
  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. You also want to diversify. Don't invest all of your savings with 1 company. 




Tip #1: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees.  




Looking for retirement income? Our free report shops 150+ annuities and highlights the companies with the highest guaranteed returns




Our Free Report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases








Tip #9: Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up.  Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.  You should do the same. 




Tip #6: You might have seen annuity ads where an annuity earned 12-15% with no risk. These come from "uncapped" index annuities. These returns are possible when market indexes go up considerably. Keep in mind these returns are not normal. 




Tip #2:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% gross and you pay 3-4% in fees, you may be better off in fixed products.




Tip #11: Shop around. Don't buy any annuity until you compare the rates, benefits and fees of all of the products available.   Rates vary considerably! The top 5 year fixed annuity is now paying 220% more interest than the bottom in our database.  




Tip #7:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income rider, we can compare 150+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 







Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today. Our free report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases to find the highest guaranteed returns. 




Tip #8:
 Longevity annuities (DIA's) allow you to take a lump sum and turn it into "income later". The US treasury department and IRS have endorsed this type of annuity in recent years and made them more accessible in 401(k) plans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
