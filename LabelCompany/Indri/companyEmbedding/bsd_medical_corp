Mission Statement
PYREXAR Medical is the pioneer and worldwide market leader in the development and manufacture of innovative and highly effective hyperthermia treatment systems with established global distribution. PYREXAR HyperThermia treatments increase the effective dose of ionizing radiation in cancerous tumors up to 3X without increasing toxicity of healthy tissues.
PYREXAR HT systems deliver therapeutic heating to cancerous tumors via non-invasive radio-frequency (RF) energy.  During PHT treatment, the cancerous tumor is gently warmed to 40-45˚C (104-113˚F) destroying the malignancy while preserving normal tissues because higher temperatures selectively damage cells that are hypoxic and have a low pH, a condition of cancer cells that is not present in normal cells.
Multi-center clinical trials in the US, Europe and Asia over the past 30 years document dramatic improvement in survival rates when PHT is combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of chest wall recurrences after breast cancer, locally advanced cervical cancer, rectal cancer, high risk soft tissue sarcoma, malignant melanoma, anal carcinoma and bladder cancer.
PYREXAR HT can now be integrated within 1.5 Tesla MR systems to provide simultaneous RF heating and MR Imaging, enabling treatment of deep primary tumors of pelvis, abdomen, and lung with real-time thermometry that is both highly accurate and non-invasive. This new multimodality treatment approach has caused renewed interest in PHT technology as a valuable adjunct to radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy and surgery.

 Improve Head and Neck Cancer Treatment with Hyperthermia





Head and Neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer in worldwide according to World Health Organization and the most common cancer in developing countries. With nearly 664,000 new cases annually. Two-thirds of these occurring in developing countries.
Clinical results like the one below reveal that Radiation treatment are more effective when combined with Hyperthermia. Hyperthermia warms the tumor to temperatures in the "fever range" which makes the cancer cells more sensitive to treatment. Normal healthy cells recover while cancer cells die.
Clinical Evidence
Tumor Entity:
Advanced Head and Neck Tumors with Lymph Node Metastasis
Treatment Modality:
In three trials patients with head and neck tumors were randomized to radio(chemo)therapy with or without hyperthermia. Radiotherapy was applied with 2 Gy fractions up to a total dose of 66-70 Gy. Chemotherapy was only applied in the study by Hua et al., to patients with T3-T4 tumors only. Hyperthermia was given once or twice weekly Valdagni, Trento Italy study used BSD-1000.  
Clinical Results:
All three studies showed a significant improvement in complete response rate, and higher local tumor control and overall survival rates, or a longer median survival, when radio(chemo)therapy was combined with hyperthermia.

Endorsements:
The combination of Radiotherapy and Hyperthermia is the treatment of choice for Head & Neck Cancer (Level I Evidence) recommended by

DEGRO German Society of Radiation Oncology
DKG Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, Germany
Dutch Society for Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands
Dutch Cancer Society, The Netherlands
ESHO European Society of Hyperhermic Oncology

Hyperthermia and Chemotherapy:
When hyperthermia is combined with chemotherapy, general treatment guidelines of the ESHO European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology recommend:

Target volume for hyperthermia: The target volume for hyperthermia is the gross tumor volume.
Sequence of treatment modalities: Hyperthermia is given simultaneously with chemotherapy during cytostasis.
Duration of hyperthermia treatment: Superficial hyperthermia total 60 minutes, deep hyperthermia total 90 minutes (including 30 minutes heating-up time) ) at temperatures of 40 to 44 °C in the whole target volume

 Improve Breast Cancer Treatment Results with Hyperthermia





Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide according to the World Cancer Research Fund International. With nearly 1.7 million new cases diagnosed in 2012 (second most common cancer overall). This represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women.
Clinical results like the one below reveal that both Chemotherapy and Radiation treatment are more effective when combined with Hyperthermia. Hyperthermia warms the tumor to temperatures in the "fever range" which makes the cancer cells more sensitive to treatment. Normal healthy cells recover while cancer cells die.
Clinical Evidence
Tumor Entity:
Results of five randomized controlled trials on radiation with or without hyperthermia in advanced or recurrent breast cancer were combined in one analysis.
Treatment Modality:
Radiotherapy, dose and scheme depending on previous irradiation or not, and varying per trial. Superficial hyperthermia was applied once or twice weekly.
Clinical Results:
The combination of results in total 306 patients showed a significant improvement in complete response rate in the group treated with radiotherapy and hyperthermia: 59% vs 41%. This initial improvement in local tumor control was maintained during follow-up. In one of the trials (ESHO), all patients were treated after previous irradiation and reirradiated with 8 fractions of 4 Gy, two fractions per week. The difference in local tumor control between the two treatment arms was significant and remarkably high in this subgroup: CR rate was 39% without hyperthermia, and 79% with hyperthermia, with similar differences in local tumor control during follow-up. Not all trials cited used the BSD-500 specifically.
Evidence Level I Randomized Clinical Trial Results on 306 Patients (Vernon et al.):

Complete Remission Rate without Hyperthermia: 41 %
Complete Remission Rate with Hyperthermia: 59 %


Subgroup after previous irradiation and reirradiated (ESHO):

Complete Remission Rate without Hyperthermia: 39 %
Complete Remission Rate with Hyperthermia: 79 %

 
Endorsements:
The combination of Radiotherapy and Hyperthermia is the treatment of choice for Breast Cancer (Level I Evidence) recommended by

DEGRO German Society of Radiation Oncology

Hyperthermia and Radiotherapy:
When hyperthermia is combined with radiotherapy, general treatment guidelines of the ESHO European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology recommend:

Target volume for hyperthermia: When the radiotherapy total dose is considered to be sufficient for a high probability of local control for microscopic disease, the target volume for hyperthermia is the gross tumor volume. When the radiotherapy total dose is lower, the target volume for hyperthermia is the clinical target volume.
Sequence of treatment modalities: Hyperthermia is given after the radiotherapy fraction, once or twice weekly with a time interval between two hyperthermia treatments of minimum 72 hours. The time interval between radiotherapy and hyperthermia may vary from 30 minutes to five hours.
Duration of hyperthermia treatment: Superficial hyperthermia total 60 minutes, deep hyperthermia maximally 90 minutes (including up to 30 minutes heating-up time) at temperatures of 40 to 44 °C in the whole target volume.

 Improve Bladder Cancer Treatment Results with Hyperthermia





Bladder cancer was the ninth most common cancer in the world according to the World Cancer Research Fund International. With more than 430,000 new cases diagnosed each year, bladder cancer is three times more common worldwide in men compared with women.
Level 1b Clinical results like the one below reveal that both Chemotherapy and Radiation treatment are more effective when combined with Hyperthermia.  Hyperthermia warms the tumor to temperatures in the "fever range" which makes the cancer cells more sensitive to treatment. Normal healthy cells recover while cancer cells die.
Clinical Information:

Tumor Entity:
Non Muscle Invasive Superficial Bladder Cancer Tumor Stage Ta & T1, Grade G1 – G3
Treatment Modality:
Chemotherapeutic intravesical instillation of Mitomycin-C (MMC) combined with intravesical hyperthermia applied preoperatively or postoperatively. 8 weekly followed by 4 monthly treatment sessions of 60 minutes each combining MMC instillation dosed as 20 mg MMC solved in 50 ml distilled water with intravesical or external regional deep hyperthermia at 42 °C +/- 2 °C.
Clinical Results as preoperative complete remission for 52 pts (Colombo 1996):

MMC chemotherapy alone 22 %
MMC chemotherapy with hyperthermia 66 %

Clinical Results for postoperative 10 y disease-free survival for 83 pts in multicenter randomized clinical trial (Colombo 2003 & 2010):

MMC chemotherapy alone 15 %
MMC chemotherapy with hyperthermia 53 %

Endorsement as Level Ib evidence by

ESHO European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology
EAU European Association of Urology
SIU Società Italiana di Urologia

Chemotherapy and Hyperthermia:
When hyperthermia is combined with chemotherapy, general treatment guidelines of the ESHO European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology recommend:

Target volume for hyperthermia: The target volume for hyperthermia is the gross tumor volume.
Sequence of treatment modalities: Hyperthermia is given simultaneously with chemotherapy during cytostasis.
Duration of hyperthermia treatment: Superficial hyperthermia total 60 minutes, deep hyperthermia total 90 minutes (including 30 minutes heating-up time)

About BSD Medical Corp.
BSD Medical Corporation engages in the development, manufacture, marketing, and service of medical systems that deliver precision-focused radio frequency (RF) or microwave energy into diseased sites of the body, heating them to specified temperatures as required for various medical therapies. The companys products are developed for the thermal treatment of cancer through using microwave/RF systems.

Products and Services

The company has developed technology and products for thermal ablation and hyperthermia cancer therapy through various techniques: thermal ablation ablates (removes or destroys) soft tissues at high temperatures through focused microwave energy; superficial hyperthermia non-invasively treats cancerous tumors located within a few centimeters of the surface of the body, such as melanoma and recurrent breast cancer; internal or interstitial hyperthermia treats tumors in combination with internal radiation therapy by inserting tiny microwave antennae that deliver hyperthermic microwave energy to tumors through the same catheters used to deliver radioactive materials (seeds) to tumors for radiation therapy, this technique would be employed in treating prostate cancer, breast cancer, head, and neck cancer, as well as other cancer sites; and deep hyperthermia non-invasively treats tumors located deep within the body.

MicroThermX Microwave Ablation System: The companys MicroThermX Microwave Ablation System (MTX-180) has been developed to employ precision-guided microwave energy to ablate soft tissue. The MTX-180 is a mobile system that includes a computer, a microwave generator, single-patient-use disposable applicators, and a thermistor-based temperature monitoring system. In March 2010, the company filed a 510(k) submission with the FDA for premarket clearance of the MTX-180. In August 2010, the FDA granted the company a 510(k) clearance to market the MTX-180 for ablation of soft tissue, authorizing the commercial sale of the MTX-180 in the United States.

BSD-500: The companys BSD-500 Hyperthermia System (BSD-500) systems are used to deliver hyperthermia therapy, which is non-invasive and delivered externally using antennae placed on the tumor, or interstitial hyperthermia therapy, which is delivered using antennae that are inserted into the tumor, or both. These systems include a touch screen display monitor by which the operator controls the hyperthermia treatment, computer equipment, and software that controls the delivery of microwave energy to the tumor, and a generator that creates the needed microwave energy for the treatment. Additionally, the systems include various applicator configurations, depending on the system. IT has received FDA approval through FDA supplements for implementation of an operating system and a power generation system and other commercial upgrades for the BSD-500 configurations.

BSD-2000: The BSD-2000 Hyperthermia System (BSD-2000) family of products includes the BSD-2000, the BSD-2000/3D, and the BSD-2000/3D/MR. These systems non-invasively deliver localized therapeutic heating (hyperthermia) to solid tumors by applying radiofrequency (RF) energy to certain cancerous tumors, including those located deep within the body. BSD 2000 systems consist of four subsystems: an RF power generator delivery subsystem; thermistor-based, thermometry subsystem; a computerized monitoring and control subsystem; and an applicator subsystem that includes an applicator and patient support system; as well as various accessories. The BSD-2000 delivers energy to a patient using a power source and a multiple antennae that surround the patients body.

BSD-2000/3D: The BSD-2000/3D adds three-dimensional steering of deep focused energy, enabling additional electronic steering along the long axis of the body.

BSD-2000/3D/MR: The company offers magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is used for monitoring the delivery of deep hyperthermia therapy. Using microwave filtering and imaging software, the BSD-2000/3D/MR allows an MRI system to be interfaced with and operate with a BSD-2000/3D.

Target Customers

The companys target customers include clinics, hospitals, and institutions in which cancer is treated, located either in the United States or international markets.

Competition

The companys competitors in the thermal ablation market include RadioTherapeutics, a division of Boston Scientific Corporation; Covidien Ltd.; Angiodynamics, Inc.; NeuWave Medical; MedWaves Incorporated; and Microsulis Medical Ltd.

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?

Tangible resources
