Lincoln is an automaker with a long  history of building upscale vehicles for the American market. A division of  Ford, Lincoln differentiates its vehicles through additional luxury features,  more powerful engines and unique styling. The automaker's lineup includes cars,  pickups and SUVs.
The company  was established in 1917 by Henry Leland, an automotive parts manufacturer who  had previously founded the Cadillac brand. He named the company after his  boyhood hero: the 16th U.S.  president, Abraham Lincoln. Early Lincoln  models include the L Series and the K Series. The company quickly hit dire  straits, however, and was bought by Ford Motor Company in 1922.
Lincoln had found its niche in the  luxury-car segment by the 1930s, riding high with the likes of Cadillac as a purveyor  of premium status-mobiles. The 1936 model year saw Lincoln's launch of the popular Zephyr. The  car's name and styling were inspired by the sleek lines of the Burlington  Zephyr, a diesel-powered express train that boasted record-setting speed. The  car was a big hit for Lincoln; at one point,  nearly 80 percent of all Lincolns  sold were Zephyrs.
The '40s  also saw the rise of the glamorous Continental. The vehicle's development was  shepherded by Edsel Ford, son of Ford's founder Henry Ford. After World War II,  Lincoln maintained its premium status with  vehicles like the Mark II and the '60s-era Continentals, which gained fame through  their "suicide-style" rear doors and use as U.S. presidential limousines. The  Continental Mark III luxury coupe rolled out in 1968 and by the late '60s, more  than 1 million Continentals had been built.
The  1970s saw the launch of the Mark IV as well as a new Lincoln,  the Versailles.  The Versailles was  the first midsize sedan from the marque, and right from the start, it missed  the mark with the public. The Versailles  was based on the Ford Granada platform, and many blamed its failure on its obvious  similarity to its less exclusive -- and less expensive -- twin.
In  1981, Lincoln released  its now iconic Town Car, the full-size luxury sedan that has since served as  the marque's flagship. Though its moniker had been used to designate trim  levels in previous years, 1981 was the year in which the Town Car came into  existence as an individual model. Lincoln also distinguished itself during  these years as the first American car line to offer antilock braking. The Mark  series continued to evolve, and shrunk down considerably with the debut of the  Mark VI. That velvet-lined cruiser was followed mid-decade by the Mark VII,  which was more European in nature and could even be powered by a BMW  turbodiesel engine.
The '90s  saw the debut of the Mark VIII, which featured a four-cam V8 and air  suspension. By this time, sport-utility vehicles had emerged as a segment to be  reckoned with, and Lincoln made the most of this trend by launching its very  first SUV, the Ford Expedition-based Navigator, for 1998. Bedecked in chrome  and fitted with plush leather and luxury features galore, the massive truck was  a breakout hit.
The  new millennium marked the debut of the Euro-flavored, midsize LS sedan that  shared much of its platform with Jaguar's S-Type sedan. More recently, Lincoln  has dropped the long-lived Town Car and updated its lineup with the MKS and MKZ  sedans as well as the MKX crossover SUV in hopes of attracting a new generation  of consumers. Some of its offerings fall short of the competition in areas such  as performance and refinement. Still, the marque is a favorite of car buyers  seeking a generous dose of all-American luxury.

We’d love to sell you a set of performance calipers and we carry the best with names like Brembo, Baer, and Wilwood. But with these calipers, what you’re paying for is their ability to make the car stop better. The fact that they also look great is just a byproduct of good design. So let’s take a look at the next alternative, painting.When done properly, painting calipers is very time consuming. First they have to be completely clean or the paint is not going to stick. And even if you do everything right, there is still a good chance that the paint will peel in the future. But the big knock against painting is that it can’t do anything about the shape of the calipers. The design of some calipers is just not that great looking, and putting them in color won’t change that.Which brings us to the best option: caliper covers. Although paint is cheaper, when you factor in what your time is worth, caliper covers are the least expensive alternative. The covers we offer are laser cut from stainless steel or from 6061-T6 aluminum, which is then given a powder coated finish. The aluminum covers are available in multiple colors and with custom logos. With caliper covers you get a durable product with a finish that will never peel, in a shape that will look great on any brake caliper.Caliper covers are easy to install, won’t interfere with brake operation, and are easy to remove when brake service is necessary. They also reduce brake dust, so those nice custom wheels will stay cleaner. And although you may not think attaching covers will make calipers cooler, they will actually reduce caliper temperatures by 30°-50°F. The covers act as a heat sink, drawing heat out of the calipers, which prolongs the life of brake system components.
While you’re installing caliper covers, why not install a set of wheel bands? These protective bands attach to the perimeter of the wheels to protect them from curb damage. They come in colors that complement caliper covers, giving your wheels a custom effect like no other. A plastic track attaches to the wheel, with a tough replaceable plastic insert that will take the brunt of a scrape instead of your rim, saving you replacement or refurbishing costs.Featured BrandsMGPAmerican Car CraftFeatured VideosMGP Caliper Covers 01Caliper Covers Overview02Ford F-150 Project0360 Second Installation Caliper Covers04Caliper Covers Introduction05Rich Evans Designs for Caliper Covers06Chevy Camaro SS Caliper Covers Installation07Caliper Covers Promo08Ford Mustang Caliper Covers Installation09MGP Caliper Covers Manufacturing Slideshow10Caliper Covers Before/After Installation11Guides & Articles Caliper CoversDecember 01, 2016Why Are Caliper Covers Only Available For My...When it comes to creating the right look for your car or truck, a shimmering set of wheels can do more to make or break its appearance than almost any other accessory....

We’d love to sell you a set of performance calipers and we carry the best with names like Brembo, Baer, and Wilwood. But with these calipers, what you’re paying for is their ability to make the car stop better. The fact that they also look great is just a byproduct of good design. So let’s take a look at the next alternative, painting.When done properly, painting calipers is very time consuming. First they have to be completely clean or the paint is not going to stick. And even if you do everything right, there is still a good chance that the paint will peel in the future. But the big knock against painting is that it can’t do anything about the shape of the calipers. The design of some calipers is just not that great looking, and putting them in color won’t change that.Which brings us to the best option: caliper covers. Although paint is cheaper, when you factor in what your time is worth, caliper covers are the least expensive alternative. The covers we offer are laser cut from stainless steel or from 6061-T6 aluminum, which is then given a powder coated finish. The aluminum covers are available in multiple colors and with custom logos. With caliper covers you get a durable product with a finish that will never peel, in a shape that will look great on any brake caliper.Caliper covers are easy to install, won’t interfere with brake operation, and are easy to remove when brake service is necessary. They also reduce brake dust, so those nice custom wheels will stay cleaner. And although you may not think attaching covers will make calipers cooler, they will actually reduce caliper temperatures by 30°-50°F. The covers act as a heat sink, drawing heat out of the calipers, which prolongs the life of brake system components.
While you’re installing caliper covers, why not install a set of wheel bands? These protective bands attach to the perimeter of the wheels to protect them from curb damage. They come in colors that complement caliper covers, giving your wheels a custom effect like no other. A plastic track attaches to the wheel, with a tough replaceable plastic insert that will take the brunt of a scrape instead of your rim, saving you replacement or refurbishing costs.Featured BrandsMGPAmerican Car CraftFeatured VideosMGP Caliper Covers 01Caliper Covers Overview02Ford F-150 Project0360 Second Installation Caliper Covers04Caliper Covers Introduction05Rich Evans Designs for Caliper Covers06Chevy Camaro SS Caliper Covers Installation07Caliper Covers Promo08Ford Mustang Caliper Covers Installation09MGP Caliper Covers Manufacturing Slideshow10Caliper Covers Before/After Installation11Guides & Articles Caliper CoversDecember 01, 2016Why Are Caliper Covers Only Available For My...When it comes to creating the right look for your car or truck, a shimmering set of wheels can do more to make or break its appearance than almost any other accessory....

Wheel covers protect the underlying stamped steel wheels and help prevent mounting studs and lug nuts from rusting, and they help make the vehicle attractive less expensively than fitting alloy wheels. Unfortunately, wheel covers are not always properly installed and can pop off when you hit a bump or pot hole, and scraping curbs can damage them, making them unsightly and weakening them, allowing them to fly off. We offer individual replacements as well as complete wheel cover sets for cars, light trucks, and even tractor trailers, to maintain or enhance your vehicle’s appearance.

At one time all wheel covers were metal but today just about all factory wheel covers are made of plastic. Three kinds of covers can be found on modern cars, differentiated by how they are attached to the wheel. The vast majority snap on and are retained in the traditional manner at the perimeter of the wheel, with spring steel clips or wire retainers. Then there is the bolt-on style that is used on a few specific makes and models, of which there are 2 types - those that are retained with the lug nuts, and those that are secured with plastic caps that thread onto the lug nuts.

Anyone who’s attempted to remove rusted lug nuts from corroded wheel studs can attest to the importance of wheel covers. Most stamped steel wheels were never designed to be exposed, and their utilitarian design and finish can also detract from an otherwise good looking vehicle’s appearance. If one of your wheel covers has become lost or damaged you can restore your vehicle’s looks and protection inexpensively with one of our new or remanufactured wheel covers. These covers will fit and perfectly match your original covers. We offer covers for all popular late-model cars in the original sizes, materials, designs, and finishes. These covers are identical to factory original, and once installed, will be indistinguishable from the rest of the wheel covers on your vehicle.

If you’ve lost a few covers or just want an easy styling upgrade, then consider installing a complete set of wheel covers. We offer covers in durable materials like tough ABS plastic in a variety of eye-catching designs and finishes that are easy to install and certain to enhance your vehicle’s appearance. Wheel covers are an easy way to get a custom look. They’re much less expensive and much less maintenance intensive than a set of custom wheels. In fact, they’re so affordable you could keep several sets on hand and change them to suit your mood. And if you have a classic car there’s no need to hunt around for used parts that are acceptable when, for select applications, we can offer you authentic reproduction hub caps and full wheel covers that are correct in every detail.


Our imposter wheel skins are an inexpensive alternative to installing a set of custom wheels or replacing damaged factory styled steel and aluminum wheels. Made of rugged, triple chrome plated ABS plastic, wheel skins are designed to overlay your factory wheels, so you can cover damage or transform dull and boring wheels into chrome wheels. They’re specifically designed for each application and custom molded for a precise fit. They just snap into place over your wheels, and correspond to every curve and feature of your wheels so well that no one will be able to tell you didn’t spring for a set of chrome rims. Wheel skins are also easy to maintain and much simpler and less expensive to replace than an alloy wheel should one become damaged.


Cars and light trucks aren’t the only vehicles that can benefit from the great looks and ease of maintenance of a wheel skins type product. For heavy-duty trucks, trailers, buses and RVs we offer wheel simulators. Simulators are similar in concept in that they conform to the shape of the wheel, and in fact some even install over the lug nuts. They’re made of rugged, polished stainless steel, and like wheel skins they’re a great way to dress up your rig without the expense of aluminum wheels, or cover up worn or corroded aluminum or steel wheels. Simulators are available in a wide range of styles in sizes from 16” to 24.5”. In addition to simulators we also offer wheel covers for tractors and trailers, including Aero covers that have been proven to provide up to 2% fuel savings.


Alloy wheels can suffer the same type of curb scrape damage as wheel covers, but are much more expensive to replace. An alternative to replacing pricey aluminum wheels due to curb damage is to prevent scrapes and scratches from occurring in the first place with wheel bands. Wheel bands have a hard plastic track that attaches to the perimeter of alloy wheels, with a plastic formula extrusion that fits inside the track. If you contact a curb, the replaceable extrusion bears the brunt of the impact, not your expensive alloy wheel. Wheel bands fit up to 22” wheels and they attach securely with 3M adhesive. Plus they’re available in your choice of several eye-catching colors, so you can give your ride a custom touch at the same time.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last.

Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right.

And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last. We can help you save money by doing the job yourself, with auto parts and tools to repair any part of your machine and maintenance supplies to help keep it going for many more miles. Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right. Regular maintenance has been proven to extend the life of a vehicle and we can help keep yours in top shape with filters, lubricants, spark plugs, brake pads and more. And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

The Lincoln Financial Foundation awards grants to nonprofit organizations in our communities according to four main funding priorities: education, human services, economic development and the arts.
How grants are awarded
Our deep connection to our communities is reflected in how we select our grantees. By establishing local Charitable Contribution Committees in our primary business locations, we empower our employees to award grants to nonprofit organizations they believe will make an enduring impact on their communities.
Read more about our communities.  
Who can apply

Only 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply for funding.*
The Lincoln Foundation only supports organizations that respect and encourage diversity and adhere to nondiscriminatory practices. Women and ethnic minorities should be adequately represented on an applicant organization's board of directors.
Support will only be considered in communities where the corporation has a significant business presence and employee base.

Philadelphia and Hartford applicants must be based in and serve these communities.
How and when to apply
Grant applications will be received according to the following schedule:
Arts (Due: January 10)
Arts education has a measurable impact on at-risk youth in deterring delinquent behavior and truancy problems, while also increasing overall academic performance, according to data from the U.S. Department of Justice and National Endowment for the Arts.
Lincoln is committed to increasing access to the arts for people of all ages, economic situations, abilities and ethnicities and support organizations to fill gaps where economic challenges have resulted in cuts to arts education. We believe this involvement can have tremendous benefits for our communities, spurring the creative economy and fostering economic development.
United Way (Due: January 10)
Lincoln Financial Group has a longstanding tradition of supporting United Way organizations. Each year, our United Way allocations provide support to agencies in the communities where we work. We also hold a workplace United Way campaign every autumn to encourage employee support for this organization.
Human services (Due: April 10)
According to the Economic Research Service, USDA, 23 percent of all children lived in households that were classified as food insecure. For many minority populations that percentage was as high as 51 percent.
Youth education (Due: July 10)
According to McKinsey and Company, the current achievement gap in the United States imposes the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession. Data from the U.S. Department of Education indicates that high school drop-outs make nearly $8,000 per year less than those with a high school diploma. Over a lifetime and across the nation, this represents billions in lost wages and spending power.
Lincoln is committed to supporting programs that promote life-long learning with an emphasis on improving financial literacy, graduation rates and student achievement.
Economic and workforce development (Due: october 10)
According to the Family Economic Success Report, the earnings gap between more educated workers and those with a high school diploma or less is growing. The number of jobs that don’t pay family-sustaining wages or provide health benefits is also increasing.
Lincoln supports organizations that provide adult education and job skills training to help build vibrant, local economies and raise the quality of life in those communities where we do business.

Description



Product Description
From the author of the New York Times bestseller A. Lincoln, a major new biography of one of America’s greatest generals—and most misunderstood presidents.
In his time, Ulysses S. Grant was routinely grouped with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in the “Trinity of Great American Leaders.” But the battlefield commander-turned-commander-in-chief fell out of favor in the twentieth century. In American Ulysses, Ronald C. White argues that we need to once more revise our estimates of him in the twenty-first.
Based on seven years of research with primary documents—some of them never examined by previous Grant scholars—this is destined to become the Grant biography of our time. White, a biographer exceptionally skilled at writing momentous history from the inside out, shows Grant to be a generous, curious, introspective man and leader—a willing delegator with a natural gift for managing the rampaging egos of his fellow officers. His wife, Julia Dent Grant, long marginalized in the historic record, emerges in her own right as a spirited and influential partner.
Grant was not only a brilliant general but also a passionate defender of equal rights in post-Civil War America. After winning election to the White House in 1868, he used the power of the federal government to battle the Ku Klux Klan. He was the first president to state that the government’s policy toward American Indians was immoral, and the first ex-president to embark on a world tour, and he cemented his reputation for personal courage by racing against death to complete his Personal Memoirs. Published by Mark Twain, it is widely considered to be the greatest memoir by an American leader, but its place in Grant’s life story has never been fully explored—until now.

Read more Lincoln history



Lincoln is an automaker with a long  history of building upscale vehicles for the American market. A division of  Ford, Lincoln differentiates its vehicles through additional luxury features,  more powerful engines and unique styling. The automaker's lineup includes cars,  pickups and SUVs.
The company  was established in 1917 by Henry Leland, an automotive parts manufacturer who  had previously founded the Cadillac brand. He named the company after his  boyhood hero: the 16th U.S.  president, Abraham Lincoln. Early Lincoln  models include the L Series and the K Series. The company quickly hit dire  straits, however, and was bought by Ford Motor Company in 1922.
Lincoln had found its niche in the  luxury-car segment by the 1930s, riding high with the likes of Cadillac as a purveyor  of premium status-mobiles. The 1936 model year saw Lincoln's launch of the popular Zephyr. The  car's name and styling were inspired by the sleek lines of the Burlington  Zephyr, a diesel-powered express train that boasted record-setting speed. The  car was a big hit for Lincoln; at one point,  nearly 80 percent of all Lincolns  sold were Zephyrs.
The '40s  also saw the rise of the glamorous Continental. The vehicle's development was  shepherded by Edsel Ford, son of Ford's founder Henry Ford. After World War II,  Lincoln maintained its premium status with  vehicles like the Mark II and the '60s-era Continentals, which gained fame through  their "suicide-style" rear doors and use as U.S. presidential limousines. The  Continental Mark III luxury coupe rolled out in 1968 and by the late '60s, more  than 1 million Continentals had been built.
The  1970s saw the launch of the Mark IV as well as a new Lincoln,  the Versailles.  The Versailles was  the first midsize sedan from the marque, and right from the start, it missed  the mark with the public. The Versailles  was based on the Ford Granada platform, and many blamed its failure on its obvious  similarity to its less exclusive -- and less expensive -- twin.
In  1981, Lincoln released  its now iconic Town Car, the full-size luxury sedan that has since served as  the marque's flagship. Though its moniker had been used to designate trim  levels in previous years, 1981 was the year in which the Town Car came into  existence as an individual model. Lincoln also distinguished itself during  these years as the first American car line to offer antilock braking. The Mark  series continued to evolve, and shrunk down considerably with the debut of the  Mark VI. That velvet-lined cruiser was followed mid-decade by the Mark VII,  which was more European in nature and could even be powered by a BMW  turbodiesel engine.
The '90s  saw the debut of the Mark VIII, which featured a four-cam V8 and air  suspension. By this time, sport-utility vehicles had emerged as a segment to be  reckoned with, and Lincoln made the most of this trend by launching its very  first SUV, the Ford Expedition-based Navigator, for 1998. Bedecked in chrome  and fitted with plush leather and luxury features galore, the massive truck was  a breakout hit.
The  new millennium marked the debut of the Euro-flavored, midsize LS sedan that  shared much of its platform with Jaguar's S-Type sedan. More recently, Lincoln  has dropped the long-lived Town Car and updated its lineup with the MKS and MKZ  sedans as well as the MKX crossover SUV in hopes of attracting a new generation  of consumers. Some of its offerings fall short of the competition in areas such  as performance and refinement. Still, the marque is a favorite of car buyers  seeking a generous dose of all-American luxury.

We’d love to sell you a set of performance calipers and we carry the best with names like Brembo, Baer, and Wilwood. But with these calipers, what you’re paying for is their ability to make the car stop better. The fact that they also look great is just a byproduct of good design. So let’s take a look at the next alternative, painting.When done properly, painting calipers is very time consuming. First they have to be completely clean or the paint is not going to stick. And even if you do everything right, there is still a good chance that the paint will peel in the future. But the big knock against painting is that it can’t do anything about the shape of the calipers. The design of some calipers is just not that great looking, and putting them in color won’t change that.Which brings us to the best option: caliper covers. Although paint is cheaper, when you factor in what your time is worth, caliper covers are the least expensive alternative. The covers we offer are laser cut from stainless steel or from 6061-T6 aluminum, which is then given a powder coated finish. The aluminum covers are available in multiple colors and with custom logos. With caliper covers you get a durable product with a finish that will never peel, in a shape that will look great on any brake caliper.Caliper covers are easy to install, won’t interfere with brake operation, and are easy to remove when brake service is necessary. They also reduce brake dust, so those nice custom wheels will stay cleaner. And although you may not think attaching covers will make calipers cooler, they will actually reduce caliper temperatures by 30°-50°F. The covers act as a heat sink, drawing heat out of the calipers, which prolongs the life of brake system components.
While you’re installing caliper covers, why not install a set of wheel bands? These protective bands attach to the perimeter of the wheels to protect them from curb damage. They come in colors that complement caliper covers, giving your wheels a custom effect like no other. A plastic track attaches to the wheel, with a tough replaceable plastic insert that will take the brunt of a scrape instead of your rim, saving you replacement or refurbishing costs.Featured BrandsMGPAmerican Car CraftFeatured VideosMGP Caliper Covers 01Caliper Covers Overview02Ford F-150 Project0360 Second Installation Caliper Covers04Caliper Covers Introduction05Rich Evans Designs for Caliper Covers06Chevy Camaro SS Caliper Covers Installation07Caliper Covers Promo08Ford Mustang Caliper Covers Installation09MGP Caliper Covers Manufacturing Slideshow10Caliper Covers Before/After Installation11Guides & Articles Caliper CoversDecember 01, 2016Why Are Caliper Covers Only Available For My...When it comes to creating the right look for your car or truck, a shimmering set of wheels can do more to make or break its appearance than almost any other accessory....

We’d love to sell you a set of performance calipers and we carry the best with names like Brembo, Baer, and Wilwood. But with these calipers, what you’re paying for is their ability to make the car stop better. The fact that they also look great is just a byproduct of good design. So let’s take a look at the next alternative, painting.When done properly, painting calipers is very time consuming. First they have to be completely clean or the paint is not going to stick. And even if you do everything right, there is still a good chance that the paint will peel in the future. But the big knock against painting is that it can’t do anything about the shape of the calipers. The design of some calipers is just not that great looking, and putting them in color won’t change that.Which brings us to the best option: caliper covers. Although paint is cheaper, when you factor in what your time is worth, caliper covers are the least expensive alternative. The covers we offer are laser cut from stainless steel or from 6061-T6 aluminum, which is then given a powder coated finish. The aluminum covers are available in multiple colors and with custom logos. With caliper covers you get a durable product with a finish that will never peel, in a shape that will look great on any brake caliper.Caliper covers are easy to install, won’t interfere with brake operation, and are easy to remove when brake service is necessary. They also reduce brake dust, so those nice custom wheels will stay cleaner. And although you may not think attaching covers will make calipers cooler, they will actually reduce caliper temperatures by 30°-50°F. The covers act as a heat sink, drawing heat out of the calipers, which prolongs the life of brake system components.
While you’re installing caliper covers, why not install a set of wheel bands? These protective bands attach to the perimeter of the wheels to protect them from curb damage. They come in colors that complement caliper covers, giving your wheels a custom effect like no other. A plastic track attaches to the wheel, with a tough replaceable plastic insert that will take the brunt of a scrape instead of your rim, saving you replacement or refurbishing costs.Featured BrandsMGPAmerican Car CraftFeatured VideosMGP Caliper Covers 01Caliper Covers Overview02Ford F-150 Project0360 Second Installation Caliper Covers04Caliper Covers Introduction05Rich Evans Designs for Caliper Covers06Chevy Camaro SS Caliper Covers Installation07Caliper Covers Promo08Ford Mustang Caliper Covers Installation09MGP Caliper Covers Manufacturing Slideshow10Caliper Covers Before/After Installation11Guides & Articles Caliper CoversDecember 01, 2016Why Are Caliper Covers Only Available For My...When it comes to creating the right look for your car or truck, a shimmering set of wheels can do more to make or break its appearance than almost any other accessory....

Wheel covers protect the underlying stamped steel wheels and help prevent mounting studs and lug nuts from rusting, and they help make the vehicle attractive less expensively than fitting alloy wheels. Unfortunately, wheel covers are not always properly installed and can pop off when you hit a bump or pot hole, and scraping curbs can damage them, making them unsightly and weakening them, allowing them to fly off. We offer individual replacements as well as complete wheel cover sets for cars, light trucks, and even tractor trailers, to maintain or enhance your vehicle’s appearance.

At one time all wheel covers were metal but today just about all factory wheel covers are made of plastic. Three kinds of covers can be found on modern cars, differentiated by how they are attached to the wheel. The vast majority snap on and are retained in the traditional manner at the perimeter of the wheel, with spring steel clips or wire retainers. Then there is the bolt-on style that is used on a few specific makes and models, of which there are 2 types - those that are retained with the lug nuts, and those that are secured with plastic caps that thread onto the lug nuts.

Anyone who’s attempted to remove rusted lug nuts from corroded wheel studs can attest to the importance of wheel covers. Most stamped steel wheels were never designed to be exposed, and their utilitarian design and finish can also detract from an otherwise good looking vehicle’s appearance. If one of your wheel covers has become lost or damaged you can restore your vehicle’s looks and protection inexpensively with one of our new or remanufactured wheel covers. These covers will fit and perfectly match your original covers. We offer covers for all popular late-model cars in the original sizes, materials, designs, and finishes. These covers are identical to factory original, and once installed, will be indistinguishable from the rest of the wheel covers on your vehicle.

If you’ve lost a few covers or just want an easy styling upgrade, then consider installing a complete set of wheel covers. We offer covers in durable materials like tough ABS plastic in a variety of eye-catching designs and finishes that are easy to install and certain to enhance your vehicle’s appearance. Wheel covers are an easy way to get a custom look. They’re much less expensive and much less maintenance intensive than a set of custom wheels. In fact, they’re so affordable you could keep several sets on hand and change them to suit your mood. And if you have a classic car there’s no need to hunt around for used parts that are acceptable when, for select applications, we can offer you authentic reproduction hub caps and full wheel covers that are correct in every detail.


Our imposter wheel skins are an inexpensive alternative to installing a set of custom wheels or replacing damaged factory styled steel and aluminum wheels. Made of rugged, triple chrome plated ABS plastic, wheel skins are designed to overlay your factory wheels, so you can cover damage or transform dull and boring wheels into chrome wheels. They’re specifically designed for each application and custom molded for a precise fit. They just snap into place over your wheels, and correspond to every curve and feature of your wheels so well that no one will be able to tell you didn’t spring for a set of chrome rims. Wheel skins are also easy to maintain and much simpler and less expensive to replace than an alloy wheel should one become damaged.


Cars and light trucks aren’t the only vehicles that can benefit from the great looks and ease of maintenance of a wheel skins type product. For heavy-duty trucks, trailers, buses and RVs we offer wheel simulators. Simulators are similar in concept in that they conform to the shape of the wheel, and in fact some even install over the lug nuts. They’re made of rugged, polished stainless steel, and like wheel skins they’re a great way to dress up your rig without the expense of aluminum wheels, or cover up worn or corroded aluminum or steel wheels. Simulators are available in a wide range of styles in sizes from 16” to 24.5”. In addition to simulators we also offer wheel covers for tractors and trailers, including Aero covers that have been proven to provide up to 2% fuel savings.


Alloy wheels can suffer the same type of curb scrape damage as wheel covers, but are much more expensive to replace. An alternative to replacing pricey aluminum wheels due to curb damage is to prevent scrapes and scratches from occurring in the first place with wheel bands. Wheel bands have a hard plastic track that attaches to the perimeter of alloy wheels, with a plastic formula extrusion that fits inside the track. If you contact a curb, the replaceable extrusion bears the brunt of the impact, not your expensive alloy wheel. Wheel bands fit up to 22” wheels and they attach securely with 3M adhesive. Plus they’re available in your choice of several eye-catching colors, so you can give your ride a custom touch at the same time.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last.

Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right.

And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last. We can help you save money by doing the job yourself, with auto parts and tools to repair any part of your machine and maintenance supplies to help keep it going for many more miles. Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right. Regular maintenance has been proven to extend the life of a vehicle and we can help keep yours in top shape with filters, lubricants, spark plugs, brake pads and more. And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

Funding in the News
"Federal Government provides 2 billion each year to help people pay their energy bills."



"Company Awards $150,000 in Business Grants"



"25 People Revieve $500,000 'Genius' Fellowships"



"100,000 in Disability Grants Approved"














Applications Are Available Today!
As you know, each and every year BILLIONS of dollars are awarded to people and organizations, in the form of free-money and other types of funding. This money comes from all different sources including but not limited to state and federal agencies and through private corporations and foundations. Most people know this money exists, but just don't know where to apply, how much they qualify for, or even where to get an application. 
Incidentally, the amount of money given away by these entities each year can vary as well as the time of the year 
			that the money is given away, so it's important to check the date the application is due and when the money will be 
			distributed.  Many people think this money is given out at the beginning of the calendar year, and this is not the rule. Some entities give out money several times a year or even all year long depending on who is eligible and who is not. 

As you know our country has bailed out banks, investment firms, and other failing businesses in recent years. You need to also know that they are not the only ones giving out money. There are thousands of private corporations and foundations, who have money to help individuals and small businesses, too, through different types of funding programs! Funding programs have eligibility criteria, which an applicant must meet before a funding application will even be considered. USA Grant Applications was designed to give you the help you need to locate and apply for these funds because if you are like most Americans, you just don't know where to start.


				"It's fast and easy and well worth it."
				--Ciara

Here are some of the categories of assistance given away by these different organizations through all different types of programs:

Small and large business ventures including start-up and expansion
Real estate ventures including rehab, repair, low-cost housing, rentals, and hundreds of other real estate-related investments
Inventions
Community development
Historical building restoration
Medical research
Education
First-time home purchase
And many others!



				"This website is easy to use since everything is outlined perfectly and easy to figure out."
				--Edgar

Don't worry about your present financial situation. Funding applications do not require collateral, credit checks, 
			security deposits or co-signers. You can apply even if you have a Bankruptcy. Also remember that government funding is not available for personal expenses or paying off debt but there may be other assistance programs out there to help you out of your situation!
Get your piece of the big funding pie. Start the Application Process Now! Don't wait. 
			The money you need may be given to your neighbor, if they qualify!

To provide you with the online training on how to apply for this funding and the support that you need to to successfully pursue your funding goals, we charge a small up-front fee to cover the marketing and advertising of this site as well as to pay our funding writer to provide the most up-to-date information on the funding world. The small fee is $29.95 an extremely fair price to pay for the wealth of online resources and application sources we provide. With your small registration fee, you will receive instant access to our members-only application sources site.
Our membership fee also comes with a GUARANTEE which states: If you apply for funding using one of the applications you find on our website and you don't receive funding, your membership fees will be refunded to you immediately. All you have to do is provide us with the name of the funding opportunity you applied for and a copy of the rejection letter you received from the funder. You will have 90 days from the date of this transaction to submit your refund request along with your denial letter.


				"It was easy and straight forward to use"
				--Danielle

Don't read any further if you are not sincerely interested in securing Funding Money. We don't want to take your money if this is something you really don't want to do. There is a lot of time and money put into searching out these applications, and we want you to be sure you are as serious about getting your share of this money as we are about giving you this information. Remember, you must qualify for the different funding programs listed on this site in order for you to receive funding and because we are not a funder, we can not guarantee that you will qualify or receive funding!
The sad news is most people never apply for any kind of funding because they just don't know "how" or "who" to apply to, not to mention the fact that they think it is too hard. It may be easier than you may think, but you will never know until you try, so what are you waiting for? Sign up today.

Lincoln Country Club, located just 45 minutes from Charlotte, in Lincolnton, North Carolina, is an 18-hole golf course enjoyable for all players. This traditionally-designed golf course features various water hazards, tree-lined fairways, and well-placed sand bunkers. Amid the rolling terrain, hardwoods and meandering creeks of the Piedmont, Lincoln Country Club has been challenging golfers since 1946. The front nine features tree-lined fairways that demand accurate tee shots, and small greens that reward precision. The back nine is more open, but being in the right places on the greens is still important. Ponds and creeks come into play on several holes while well-placed sand bunkers are incorporated into the course's traditional design. Four sets of tees will test players of every ability. Don't miss out on a chance to play Lincoln Country Club. Book a tee time today.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
