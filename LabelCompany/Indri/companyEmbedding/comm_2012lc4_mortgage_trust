FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

There’s a mortgage product to meet almost any need
From first-time buyer programs to reverse mortgages to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), today’s lenders offer products that allow borrowers to:

Buy property with a low (or no) down payment
Build a house
Exchange home equity for cash
Purchase rental housing
Refinance to a better interest rate
Supplement monthly income
Renovate their residences











 



Types of mortgage programs
Consumers should discuss their options with mortgage lenders to come up with the program that best meets their needs. Home mortgages can be classified in several ways:

Fixed rate or adjustable rate
Conforming or jumbo loan amount
Government or conventional
Purchase or refinance
Prime or sub-prime
Traditional (forward) or reverse
Construction or permanent
First or second mortgage
















What to do before applying for a mortgage loan?
Once they have selected a program, borrowers should compare mortgage rates and terms. That’s easy to do online with sites like LendingTree.com. When comparing mortgage programs, consumers should get the same information from each lender. This includes interest rate, duration of interest rate (Does it adjust? When? By how much?), loan term (15 year, 30 year, etc.), lender fees and 3rd party charges, APR, features like interest-only payments or prepayment penalties, and mortgage insurance or funding fees.
It’s important when shopping for a mortgage to get all home loan quotes at approximately the same time. Mortgage interest rates change constantly, because they are affected by the prices of bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are bought and sold like stocks. Global economic news, Treasury auctions and decisions by the Federal Reserve can cause mortgage rates to move up and down very suddenly. Just as stock prices change all day long, so can mortgage rates. This means a quote from Lender A on Monday can’t reliably be compared to one from Lender B on Wednesday. LendingTree allows consumers to easily compare real-time quotes from competing mortgage lenders, helping them make informed choices and save money.

Loan Type:
Home Purchase

Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Home Type:
Single Family
Town House
Condo
Multifamily
Co-op



Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 27, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper rise, a holding steady, or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including:

This morning's domestic economic data – Durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected, though the former figure was inflated by one-time orders for aircraft. Meanwhile, the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing.


The U.S. Treasury will be auctioning 7-year notes at 1:00 pm (ET).
Skittishness ahead of tomorrow's announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for 2017's second quarter.
Events on Capitol Hill as the U.S. Senate continues to debate health care reform. To some, the credibility of President Trump's wider business and tax agenda is at stake.

If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages inched down yesterday, giving some relief after Tuesday's sharp rise. They remain close to where they were between July 12-18. Rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

What do I need to know about home financing?



​

How much can I really afford?
Factor in your income, down payment amount and existing debts to calculate what purchase price and payment makes sense for your budget.



​

The importance of your credit score

Knowledge is power that nets you negotiating leverage with lenders. Get your free credit score and keep track of it.




​

Get a better interest rate

Interest rates are always changing. If you’re stuck paying a high interest rate on your loan, you should check your options. You could save a lot every month.




​

Smaller down payment

You can put as little as 3.5% down. It doesn’t even have to be your own money – the down payment can be a gift or loan.




​

Is an FHA loan right for me?

If you need to finance more than 80 percent of your home’s purchase price or appraised value, an FHA loan might be right for you.




​

What about VA mortgages?

If you’re an eligible veteran and need to finance more than 80 percent of your home’s purchase price or appraised value, a VA loan may be a good option for you.








What is a Mortgage?
A mortgage, or mortgage loan, is a legal agreement where a lender offers money to a borrower to purchase real estate in exchange for interest. The loan is secured by the real estate, so if the borrower fails to repay (defaults) the lender can foreclose, selling the property to pay off the loan.

                      Top 10 mistakes first-time buyers make                    





1

Not knowing how much house you can afford.



2

Spending the maximum you can afford.



3

Letting the real estate agent know how much you love the house. (You lose your upper hand in negotiations this way.)



4

Not getting preapproved.



5

Failing to budget for long term repair and maintenance costs.






6

Failing to budget for property taxes.



7

Skipping the home inspection.



8

Not considering the resale value.



9

Not getting it in writing. If it’s just verbal, it’s not legal.



10

Choosing the wrong mortgage product for your needs. (30-year fixed isn’t right for everyone. You may be surprised that interest only or ARM might actually be ok for you.)

HARP Loan

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

EXHIBIT 99.3
 
 
MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
 
This Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (this “Agreement”), is dated and effective March 20, 2012 between Guggenheim Life and Annuity Company, as seller (the “Seller”), and Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation, as purchaser (the “Purchaser”).
 
The Seller desires to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, the commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing mortgage loans (collectively, the “Mortgage Loans”) identified on the schedule annexed hereto as Exhibit A (the “Mortgage Loan Schedule”).
 
It is expected that the Mortgage Loans will be transferred, together with other commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing mortgage loans (such Mortgage Loans, the “Other Mortgage Loans”) to COMM 2012-LC4 Mortgage Trust, a trust fund (the “Trust Fund”) to be formed by the Purchaser, the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by a series of mortgage pass-through certificates (the “Certificates”).  The offer and sale of certain classes of the Certificates (the “Registered Certificates”) will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).  The Trust Fund will be created and the Certificates will be issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement to be dated as of March 1, 2012 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), among the Purchaser, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the “Master Servicer”), CWCapital Asset Management LLC, as special servicer (the “Special Servicer”), Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as certificate administrator, custodian and paying agent (in its capacity as certificate administrator, the “Certificate Administrator”), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the “Operating Advisor”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).
 
The Purchaser intends to sell the Registered Certificates to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“DBS”), Ladder Capital Securities LLC (“Ladder”), Guggenheim Securities, LLC (“Guggenheim”), Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS”) and RBS Securities Inc. (“RBS”  and, together with DBS, Ladder, Guggenheim and MS in such capacity, the “Underwriters”) pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated March 1, 2012 (the “Underwriting Agreement”).  The Purchaser intends to sell other Certificates (the “Non-Registered Certificates”) to DBS, Ladder and Guggenheim (together, in such capacity, the “Initial Purchasers”) pursuant to a certificate purchase agreement dated March 1, 2012 (the “Certificate Purchase Agreement”).  Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (in effect as of the Closing Date) or in the Indemnification Agreement, dated March 1, 2012 (the “Indemnification Agreement”), among the Seller, the Purchaser, the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers.
 
Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
 


 


 





 


 
SECTION 1.          Agreement to Purchase.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser upon receipt of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in this Section 1, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Mortgage Loans.  The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on March 20, 2012 or such other date as shall be mutually acceptable to the parties hereto (the “Closing Date”).  As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans will have an aggregate principal balance (the “Aggregate Cut-off Date Balance”), after application of all payments of principal due thereon on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received, of $129,495,555.46, subject to a variance of plus or minus 5.0%.  The purchase price of the Mortgage Loans (inclusive of accrued interest and exclusive of the Seller’s share of the costs set forth in Section 9(c) hereof) shall be equal to the amount set forth on the cross receipt between the Seller and the Purchaser dated the date hereof and the Class X-ALA Certificates (collectively, the "Mortgage Loan Purchase Price").
 
SECTION 2.          Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.
 
(a)           On the Closing Date, subject only to receipt by the Seller of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price, the satisfaction of the other closing conditions required to be satisfied on the part of Purchaser pursuant to Section 7 and the issuance of the Certificates, the Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without recourse, all the right, title and interest of the Seller from and after the Closing Date in and to the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, including all rights to payment in respect thereof, which, notwithstanding the foregoing, includes all interest and principal received or receivable by the Seller on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date (subject to the proviso in the next sentence), together with all of the Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the proceeds of any related title, hazard, or other insurance policies and any escrow, reserve or other comparable accounts related to the Mortgage Loans, subject to that certain Agreement to Appointment of Master Servicer dated as of March 1, 2012, between the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the Seller.  The Purchaser shall be entitled to (and, to the extent received by or on behalf of the Seller, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser) all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date, and all other recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after the Cut-off Date; provided, however, that all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off Date shall belong to the Seller, and the Purchaser or its successors or assigns shall promptly remit any such payments to the Seller.
 
Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall, or shall at the expense of the Seller cause a third party vendor (which may be the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Custodian pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or otherwise) to, (1) complete (to the extent necessary) and record (in favor of the Trustee, in trust for the Holders of Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation, COMM 2012-LC4 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates) in the appropriate public recording office (a) each Assignment of Mortgage referred to in clause (iii) of Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for recording and (b) each Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits referred to in clause (viii)(B) of Exhibit B (if not otherwise included in the related Assignment of Mortgage) which has not yet been submitted for recordation; and (2) complete (to the extent necessary) and

file in the appropriate public filing office each UCC assignment of financing statement referred to in clause (v)(B) and (xiii) of Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for filing or recording.  In the event that any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the Seller shall promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure or cause the curing of such defect, as the case may be, and shall thereafter deliver the substitute or corrected document to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, the Trustee) for recording or filing, as appropriate, at the Seller’s expense.  The Seller shall, or shall cause a third party vendor or any other party under its control to, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or filed copy (and in no event later than 5 Business Days following such receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence of filing or recording thereon.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2, in those instances where the public recording office retains the original Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, if applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations hereunder of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon delivery to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits.
 
On the Closing Date, upon (i) notification from the Seller that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in Section 1 has been received by the Seller and (ii) the issuance of the Certificates, the Purchaser shall be authorized to release to the Trustee or its designee all of the Mortgage Files in the Purchaser’s possession relating to the Mortgage Loans.
 
(b)           In connection with the Seller’s assignment pursuant to subsection (a) above, and subject to subsections (c) and (d) below, the Seller shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, on or before the Closing Date, the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix) of Exhibit B for each Mortgage Loan so assigned (with originals with respect to clause (i) and copies with respect to clauses (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix)) and, except as otherwise provided in Section 2(d) below, within 30 days following the Closing Date, the remaining applicable documents in Exhibit B for each such Mortgage Loan, with copies to the Master Servicer.
 
(c)           If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original Note, the Seller shall deliver a copy or duplicate original of such Note, together with an affidavit certifying that the original thereof has been lost or destroyed and an indemnification in connection therewith in favor of the Trustee.
 
(d)           If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of any of the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (ii), (v)(A), (viii)(A), (xiv) and (xvi) of Exhibit B and the UCC financing statements and UCC assignments of financing statements referred to in clause (xiii) of Exhibit B, with evidence of recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay caused by the public recording or filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or because such original recorded or filed document has been lost or returned from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost, as the case may be, the delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be

deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that a copy of such document or instrument (without evidence of recording or filing thereon, but certified (which certificate may relate to multiple documents and/or instruments) by the applicable public recording or filing office, the applicable title insurance company or by the Seller to be a true and complete copy of the original thereof submitted for recording or filing, as the case may be) has been delivered to the Custodian within 45 days after the Closing Date, and either the original of such missing document or instrument, or a copy thereof, with evidence of recording or filing, as the case may be, thereon, is delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee) within 180 days after the Closing Date (or within such longer period after the Closing Date as the Custodian may consent to, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as the Seller has provided the Custodian with evidence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, or has certified to the Custodian as to the occurrence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, and is, as certified to the Custodian no less often than quarterly, in good faith attempting to obtain from the appropriate public recording or filing office such original or copy, provided such extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).
 
If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of the related lender’s title insurance policy referred to in clause (vii) of Exhibit B solely because such policy has not yet been issued, the delivery requirements of  Section 2(b) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that the Seller has delivered to the Custodian a binder marked as binding and countersigned by the title insurer or its authorized agent (which may be a pro forma or specimen title insurance policy which has been accepted or approved in writing as binding by the related title insurance company) or an acknowledged closing instruction or escrow letter, and the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee), promptly following the receipt thereof, the original related lender’s title insurance policy (or a copy thereof).
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the documents referred to in clause (xix) and clause (xx) on Exhibit B, the Seller acknowledges that the Master Servicer will hold the original of each such document in trust on behalf of the Trustee in order to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust and the Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied the delivery requirements of this Agreement by delivering the original of each such document to the Master Servicer.  The Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment of such letter of credit required (which assignment or amendment shall change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to the Trust in care of the Master Servicer) in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust.  In the event that the documents specified in clause (xx) on Exhibit B are missing because the related assignment or amendment documents have not been completed, the Seller shall take all reasonably necessary steps to enable the Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit on behalf of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing on the letter of credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions from the Master Servicer and immediately remitting such funds (or causing such funds to be remitted) to the Master Servicer.

Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement by the Purchaser and the Seller, the Seller shall deliver a power of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto to each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, that permits such parties to take such other action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or recordation of any documents and/or instruments relating to any Mortgage Loan which have not been delivered, assigned or recorded at the time required for enforcement by the Trust Fund.  The Seller will be required to effect at its expense the assignment and, if applicable, recordation of its Loan Documents until the assignment and recordation of all such Loan Documents has been completed.
 
(e)           Except as provided below, all documents and records in the Seller’s possession (or under its control) relating to the Mortgage Loans that are not required to be a part of a Mortgage File in accordance with Exhibit B but that are reasonably required to service the Mortgage Loans and copies of the documents in the Mortgage File (all such other documents and records, including Environmental Reports, as to any Mortgage Loan, the “Servicing File”), together with all escrow payments, reserve funds and other comparable funds in the possession of the Seller (or under its control) with respect to the Mortgage Loans, shall (unless they are held by a sub-servicer that shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer pursuant to a written agreement between such parties) be delivered by the Seller (or its agent) to the Master Servicer (as the Purchaser’s designee) no later than the Closing Date; provided, however, the Seller shall not be required to deliver, and the Servicing File shall not be deemed to include drafts of Loan Documents, attorney-client or internal communications of the Seller or its affiliates or Seller’s credit underwriting or due diligence analyses or related data (as distinguished from Environmental Reports, financial statements, credit reports, title reports, structural and engineering reports, appraisals and other reports, analyses or data provided by the Borrowers or third parties other than the Seller’s attorneys).  If a sub-servicer shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to a written agreement between such parties, the Seller or its agent shall deliver a copy of the related Servicing File to the Master Servicer.
 
(f)           Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will treat, and their respective records will reflect, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser as a sale, including for tax and accounting purposes.  Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, the Seller will not take any action inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser or its assignees.
 
(g)          Furthermore, it is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser as provided in this Agreement be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser and not a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of Seller.  However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property of Seller or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans:
 
    (i)           this Agreement shall hereby create a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the applicable state;
 


 


5





 


 
(ii)          the conveyance provided for in this Agreement shall hereby grant from Seller to Purchaser a security interest in and to all of Seller’s right, title, and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to:
 
(A)           all accounts, contract rights (including any guarantees), general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, money, deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, goods, letters of credit, advices of credit and investment property consisting of, arising from or relating to any of the property described in the Mortgage Loans, including the related Notes, Mortgages and title, hazard and other insurance policies, identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, and all distributions with respect thereto payable after the Cut-off Date;
 
(B)           all accounts, contract rights, general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, money, deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, goods, letters of credit, advices of credit and investment property arising from or by virtue of the disposition of, or collections with respect to, or insurance proceeds payable with respect to, or claims against other Persons with respect to, all or any part of the collateral described in clause (A) above (including any accrued discount realized on liquidation of any investment purchased at a discount), in each case, payable after the Cut-off Date; and
 
(C)           all cash and non-cash proceeds of the collateral described in clauses (A) and (B) above payable after the Cut-off Date;
 
(iii)       the possession by Purchaser or its assignee of the Notes and such other goods, letters of credit, advices of credit, instruments, money, documents, chattel paper or certificated securities shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party or possession by a purchaser or a Person designated by him or her, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (including, without limitation, Sections 9-306, 9-313 and 9-314 thereof) as in force in the relevant jurisdiction; and
 
(iv)       notifications to Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts, confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents of, or Persons holding for (as applicable), Purchaser or its assignee for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law.
 
The Seller at the direction of the Purchaser or its assignee, shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof, such security interest would be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement.  In connection herewith, Purchaser and its assignee shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party and creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in the relevant jurisdiction and may execute and file such UCC Financing Statements as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to accomplish the foregoing.

(h)           It is further acknowledged and agreed by the Seller that the Purchaser intends to convey all right, title and interest of the Purchaser from and after the Closing Date in and to the Mortgage Loans and all rights and remedies under this Agreement (excluding the Purchaser’s rights and remedies under Sections 6(e)-(g), 9 and 11 of this Agreement) to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, including, without limitation, all rights and remedies as may be available under Section 6 to the Purchaser in the event of a Material Breach or a Material Defect, and the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, as assignee of the Purchaser, or such other party as may be specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall be entitled to enforce any obligations of the Seller hereunder in connection with a Material Breach or a Material Defect as if the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders had been an original party to this Agreement.
 
SECTION 3.          Examination of Mortgage Files and Due Diligence Review.
 
The Seller shall reasonably cooperate with any examination of the Mortgage Files and Servicing Files that may be undertaken by or on behalf of the Purchaser.  The fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct any partial or complete examination of the Mortgage Files and/or Servicing Files shall not affect the Purchaser’s right to pursue any remedy available in equity or at law under Section 6 for a breach of the Seller’s representations, warranties and covenants set forth in or contemplated by Section 4.
 
SECTION 4.          Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Seller.
 
(a)           The Seller hereby makes, as of the date hereof (or as of such other date specifically provided in the particular representation or warranty), to and for the benefit of the Purchaser, each of the representations and warranties set forth in Exhibit D with respect to each Mortgage Loan, subject to the exceptions set forth in Schedule D-1 to Exhibit D.
 
(b)           In addition, the Seller, as of the date hereof, hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with, the Purchaser that:
 
(i)         The Seller is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is in compliance with the laws of each State in which any Mortgaged Property is located to the extent necessary to ensure the enforceability of each Mortgage Loan and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
 
(ii)        The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, and the performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement by the Seller, do not violate the Seller’s organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its assets, in each case which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Seller to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(iii)       The Seller has the full corporate power and authority to enter into and consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has duly authorized the 
 


 


7

(iv)       This Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchaser, constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with the terms hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, liquidation, moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, including if the Seller is determined to be a “financial company” or an affiliate thereof under Section 201 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver under Title II (Orderly Liquidation Authority) of the Dodd-Frank Act, (B) general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and (C) public policy considerations underlying the securities laws, to the extent that such public policy considerations limit the enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement that purport to provide indemnification or contribution for securities laws liabilities.
 
(v)        The Seller is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement do not constitute a violation of, any law, any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter, or any order, regulation or demand of any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority, which violation, in the Seller’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to affect materially and adversely either the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Seller.
 
(vi)       No litigation is pending or, to the best of the Seller’s knowledge, threatened against the Seller the outcome of which, in the Seller’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to materially and adversely affect the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Seller.
 
(vii)      The Seller has not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent or other Person, other than the Purchaser, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, and their respective affiliates, that may be entitled to any commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the Mortgage Loans or the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.
 
(viii)    No consent, approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice to, any governmental authority or court is required, under federal or state law (including, with respect to any bulk sale laws), for the execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of, or compliance by the Seller with, this Agreement, or the consummation by the Seller of any transaction contemplated hereby, other than (1) the filing or recording of financing statements, instruments of assignment and other similar documents necessary in connection with the Seller’s sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, (2) such consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, registrations, filings or notices as have been obtained, made or given and (3) where the lack of such consent, approval, authorization, qualification, registration,

filing or notice would not have a material adverse effect on the performance by the Seller under this Agreement.
 
(c)           Upon discovery by any of the Seller or the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of a breach of any of the representations and warranties made pursuant to and set forth in subsection (b) above which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made pursuant to subsection (a) above and set forth in Exhibit D that materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser or the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, the party discovering such breach shall (if the discovering party is the Seller), or shall be required pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (if the discovering party is a party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) to, give prompt written notice of such breach to the Seller and/or the other parties, as applicable.
 
SECTION 5.          Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Purchaser.
 
(a)        The Purchaser, as of the date hereof, hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with, the Seller that:
 
(i)         The Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of State of Delaware.
 
(ii)        The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser, and the performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement by the Purchaser, do not violate the Purchaser’s organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its assets.
 
(iii)       The Purchaser has the full power and authority to enter into and consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has duly authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.

(v)        The Purchaser is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement will not constitute a violation of, any law, any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter, or any order, regulation or demand of any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority, which violation, in the Purchaser’s good faith and reasonable

judgment, is likely to affect materially and adversely either the ability of the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Purchaser.
 
   (vi)          No litigation is pending or, to the best of the Purchaser’s knowledge, threatened against the Purchaser which would prohibit the Purchaser from entering into this Agreement or, in the Purchaser’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to materially and adversely affect either the ability of the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Purchaser.
 
(vii)         The Purchaser has not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent or other Person, other than the Seller, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, that may be entitled to any commission or compensation in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
(viii)        No consent, approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice to, any governmental authority or court is required, under federal or state law, for the Purchaser’s execution, delivery and performance of or compliance by the Purchaser with this Agreement, or the consummation by the Purchaser of any transaction contemplated hereby, other than (1) such consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, registrations, filings or notices as have been obtained, made or given and (2) where the lack of such consent, approval, authorization, qualification, registration, filing or notice would not have a material adverse effect on the performance by the Purchaser under this Agreement.
 
(b)           Upon discovery by any of the parties hereto of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth above which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Seller, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice of such breach to the other party or parties hereto.
 
SECTION 6.          Repurchases; Substitutions.
 
(a)           If the Purchaser discovers that any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File has not been delivered within the time periods provided for herein, has not been properly executed, is missing, does not appear to be regular on its face or contains information that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (each, a “Defect”), or discovers or receives notice of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller made pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan (a “Breach”), and if such Defect is a Material Defect or such Breach is a Material Breach, then the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Seller.  If any such Defect or Breach materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser, then such Defect shall constitute a “Material Defect” or such Breach shall constitute a “Material Breach,” as the case may be; provided, however, that if any of the documents specified in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), 
 


 


10





 


 
(xi) and (xix) of the definition of “Mortgage File” is (subject to Sections 2(c) and 2(d) hereof) not delivered, and is certified as missing pursuant to Section 2.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, it shall be deemed a Material Defect.  Promptly upon receiving written notice of any Material Defect or Material Breach with respect to a Mortgage Loan, accompanied by a written demand to take the actions contemplated by this sentence, the Seller shall, not later than 90 days from the Seller’s receipt from the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) of notice of, and demand to take action with respect to, such Material Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be (or, in the case of a Material Defect or Material Breach relating to a Mortgage Loan not being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions, not later than 90 days after the Seller or any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement discovers such Material Defect or Material Breach) (any such 90-day period, the “Initial Resolution Period”), (i) cure the same in all material respects, (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Repurchase Price or (iii) substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan (provided that in no event shall such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account any Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection therewith; provided that if (i) such Material Defect or Material Breach (other than one relating to a deemed Material Defect under the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence) is capable of being cured but not within the Initial Resolution Period, (ii) such Material Defect or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan’s not being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Defect or Material Breach within the Initial Resolution Period, then the Seller shall have an additional period equal to the applicable Resolution Extension Period to complete such cure or, failing such cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a hotel, restaurant (operated by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted living facility, self-storage facility, theatre or fitness center (operated by a Borrower) property, then the failure to deliver to the Trustee copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect.
 
If the Seller is notified of a Defect in any Mortgage File that also affects information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Seller shall promptly correct such Defect and provide a new, corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Purchaser, which corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule shall be deemed to amend and replace the existing Mortgage Loan Schedule for all purposes.  The failure of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to notify the Seller of a Material Defect or Material Breach shall not constitute a waiver of any cure or repurchase obligation, provided that the Seller must receive written notice thereof as described in this Section 6(a) before commencement of the Initial Resolution Period.
 
If (x) there exists a Breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the Seller as set forth in, or made pursuant to, representation 36 or 37 of Exhibit D to this Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by the Borrower associated with the exercise of a defeasance option, a waiver of a “due-on-sale” provision or a “due-on-encumbrance” provision or the release of any Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically 
 


 


11





 


 
prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer from requiring the related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon notice by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, the Seller may cure such breach by transferring to the Collection Account, within 90 days of the Seller’s receipt of such notice, the amount of any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that are the basis of such Breach. Upon its making such deposit, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects.  Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any such Breach, regardless of whether it constitutes a Material Breach, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or otherwise cure such Breach.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(a), in lieu of the Seller performing its obligations with respect to any Material Breach or Material Defect provided in the three preceding paragraphs, to the extent that the Seller and the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund, and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative) are able to agree upon a cash payment payable by the Seller to the Purchaser that would be deemed sufficient to compensate the Purchaser for a Material Breach or Material Defect (a “Loss of Value Payment”), the Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay such Loss of Value Payment to the Purchaser; provided that a Material Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a “qualified mortgage”, within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3), may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment.  Upon its making such payment, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Material Breach or Material Defect in all respects.  Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any such Material Breach or Material Defect, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material Defect.
 
(b)         In connection with any repurchase of, or substitution for, a Mortgage Loan contemplated by this Section 6:
 
(i)          the Trustee, the Master Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan other than a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan that is a Specially Serviced Loan), pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall each be required to tender to the Seller, and the Seller shall be entitled to receive therefrom, all portions of the Mortgage File and other documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon delivery:
 
(A)            to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a trust receipt, and
 
(B)            to the Trustee by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall Amount from the Seller;
 
(ii)         each document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was endorsed or assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned without recourse in the
 


 


12





 


 
form of endorsement or assignment provided to the Trustee by the Seller, as the case may be, to the Seller as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller the legal and beneficial ownership of each Removed Mortgage Loan to the extent such ownership was transferred to the Trustee; and
 
(iii)          the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall release, or cause the release of, any escrow payments and reserve funds held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan(s) to the Seller.
 
(c)           This Section 6 provides the sole remedies available to the Purchaser, and its successors and permitted assigns (i.e., the Trustee and the holders of the Certificates) in respect of any Defect in a Mortgage File or any Breach.  If the Seller defaults on its obligations to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section 6, or disputes its obligation to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 6, the Purchaser may take such action as is appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including, without limitation, the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings.  To the extent the Purchaser prevails in such proceeding, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of such obligation of the Seller to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section 6.  To the extent the Seller prevails in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan, the Seller will not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant to the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Loan Documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Loan Documents and the Seller provides an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur and (iii) each Rating Agency then rating the Certificates shall have provided a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to such release.
 
(d)           As to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the Trustee, the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master Servicer), the related Mortgage File with the related Note endorsed as required by Exhibit B hereto.  Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of substitution shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received by the Master Servicer, shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to the related Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date.  For the month of repurchase or substitution, distributions to Certificateholders pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will include the Monthly Payment(s) due on the related Removed Mortgage Loan and received by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of repurchase or substitution, as applicable, and the Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts received thereafter in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan.

In any month in which the Seller substitutes one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Removed Mortgage Loans, pursuant to this Agreement, the Master Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount.  At the direction of the Certificate Administrator, the Seller shall deposit, or deliver to the Master Servicer for deposit, into the Collection Account cash equal to such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Mortgage Files for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, without any reimbursement thereof.  Any Mortgage Loan that is repurchased or replaced by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6 shall constitute a “Removed Mortgage Loan”.
 
(e)           If the Seller (i) receives from any Person (other than the Depositor) any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request; (ii) rejects any Repurchase Request or is in dispute with the Person making any Repurchase Request as to the merits of such Repurchase Request (a “Dispute”); or (iii) receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request Withdrawal, then the Seller shall deliver notice thereof (each, a “15Ga-1 Notice”) to the Depositor within ten Business Days of the Seller’s receipt thereof (or in the case of a rejection or Dispute, the occurrence thereof).  Each 15Ga-1 Notice shall include (i) the identity of the related Mortgage Loan, (ii) the date the Repurchase Communication of the Repurchase Request or the Repurchase Request Withdrawal was received, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of a Repurchase Request, the identity of the Person making such Repurchase Request and, if known, the basis for the Repurchase Request (as asserted in the Repurchase Request).
 
“Repurchase Communication” means, for purposes of this Section 6(e) only, any communication, whether oral or written, which need not be in any specific form.
 
(f)           The Seller shall provide to the Depositor relevant portions of any Form ABS-15G that the Seller is required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (only to the extent that such portions relate to any Mortgage Loan) on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days before the date such Form ABS-15G is required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In connection with such filing, upon the request of the Seller, the Depositor shall provide to the Seller the Trust Fund’s Central Index Key (CIK) number and such other information regarding the principal balances of the Mortgage Loans as is reasonably necessary for the Seller to complete and file such Form ABS-15G.
 
(g)         The Seller agrees that a 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will not, in connection with providing the Seller with any 15Ga-1 Notice (for purposes of this Section 6(g) only, as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), be required to provide any information protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrines.  In addition, the Seller hereby acknowledges that (i) any 15Ga-1 Notice provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is so provided only to assist the Seller, the Depositor and its Affiliates to comply with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and any other requirement of law or regulation and (ii) (A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a 15Ga-1 Notice Provider and (B) no information provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by a 15Ga-1 Notice Provider, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any legal right the 15Ga-1 Notice Provider may have with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to any Repurchase Request that is the subject of a 15Ga-1 Notice.

(h)           Each party hereto agrees that the receipt of a 15Ga-1 Notice or the delivery of any notice required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 6 shall not, in and of itself, constitute delivery of notice of, receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the Seller of, any Material Defect or Material Breach.
 
SECTION 7.          Closing.
 
The closing of the purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans (the “Closing”) shall be held at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, One World Financial Center, New York, New York 10281 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date.
 
The Closing shall be subject to each of the following conditions:
 
(i)           All of the representations and warranties of the Seller and the Purchaser specified herein shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date, and the Aggregate Cut-off Date Balance shall be within the range permitted by Section 1 of this Agreement;

(iii)         The Seller shall have delivered and released to the Trustee, the Purchaser or the Purchaser’s designee, as the case may be, all documents and funds required to be so delivered on or before the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2;
 
(iv)         The result of any examination of the Mortgage Files and Servicing Files performed by or on behalf of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3 shall be satisfactory to the Purchaser in its reasonable determination;
 
(v)          All other terms and conditions of this Agreement required to be complied with on or before the Closing Date shall have been complied with, and the Seller shall have the ability to comply with all terms and conditions and perform all duties and obligations required to be complied with or performed after the Closing Date;
 
(vi)         The Seller shall have received the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price, and the Seller shall have paid or agreed to pay all fees, costs and expenses payable by it to the Purchaser as of the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement; and

MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER
REGARDING THE INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE LOANS
 
With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Seller hereby represents and warrants, as of the date herein specified or, if no such date is specified, as of the Closing Date, except as set forth on Schedule D-1 hereto, that:
 
1)           Payment Record.  No Mortgage Loan is 30 days or more delinquent in payment of principal and interest (without giving effect to any applicable grace period in the related Note) and no Mortgage Loan has been 30 days or more (without giving effect to any applicable grace period in the related Note) past due.
 
2)           Fixed Rate Loan.  Each Mortgage Loan (exclusive of any default interest, late charges or prepayment premiums) is a fixed rate mortgage loan with a term to maturity, at origination or as of the most recent modification, as set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule.
 
3)           Mortgage Loan Schedule.  The information pertaining to each Mortgage Loan set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule is true and correct in all material respects as of the Cut-off Date.
 
4)           Ownership of Mortgage Loan.  At the time of the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, the Seller had good and marketable title to and was the sole owner and holder of, each Mortgage Loan, free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or security interest (subject to certain agreements regarding servicing as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, any subservicing agreements permitted thereunder and that certain Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date between the Master Servicer and the Seller) and such assignment validly and effectively transfers and conveys all legal and beneficial ownership of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or security interest (subject to certain agreements regarding servicing as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, any subservicing agreements permitted thereunder and that certain Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date between the Master Servicer and the Seller).
 
5)           Borrower; Bankruptcy.  In respect of each Mortgage Loan, as of the origination date and, to the Seller’s actual knowledge, as of the Closing Date, (A) in reliance on public documents or certified copies of the incorporation or partnership or other entity documents, as applicable, delivered in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, the related Borrower is an entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and (B) the related Borrower is not a debtor in any bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding.
 


 


D-1





 


 
6)           Mortgage Lien; Assignment of Leases.  Each Mortgage Loan is secured by the related Mortgage which establishes and creates a valid and subsisting first priority lien on the related Mortgaged Property, or leasehold interest therein, comprising real estate, free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances, participation interests, pledges, charges or security interests subject only to Permitted Encumbrances.  Such Mortgage, together with any separate security agreement, UCC Financing Statement or similar agreement, if any, establishes and creates a first priority security interest in favor of the Seller in all personal property owned by the Borrower that is used in, and is reasonably necessary to, the operation of the related Mortgaged Property and, to the extent a security interest may be created therein and perfected by the filing of a UCC Financing Statement under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction, the proceeds arising from the Mortgaged Property and other collateral securing such Mortgage Loan, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances.  There exists with respect to such Mortgaged Property an assignment of leases and rents provision, either as part of the related Mortgage or as a separate document or instrument, which establishes and creates a first priority security interest in and to leases and rents arising in respect of the related Mortgaged Property, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances.  To the Seller’s knowledge, no Person other than the related Borrower and the mortgagee own any interest in any payments due under the related leases.  The related Mortgage or such assignment of leases and rents provision provides for the appointment of a receiver for rents or allows the holder of the related Mortgage to enter into possession of the related Mortgaged Property to collect rent or provides for rents to be paid directly to the holder of the related Mortgage in the event of a default beyond applicable notice and grace periods, if any, under the related Loan Documents.  As of the origination date, there were, and, to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Closing Date, there are, no mechanics’ or other similar liens or claims which have been filed for work, labor or materials affecting the related Mortgaged Property which are or may be prior or equal to the lien of the Mortgage, except those that are bonded or escrowed for or which are insured against pursuant to the applicable Title Insurance Policy (as defined below) and except for Permitted Encumbrances.  No Mortgaged Property secures any mortgage loan not represented on the Mortgage Loan Schedule.  No Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with any other mortgage loan, other than a Mortgage Loan listed on the Mortgage Loan Schedule.  No Mortgage Loan is secured by property that is not a Mortgaged Property.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rent, operating revenues or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the recordation of the Mortgage or the Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or the filing of UCC Financing Statements are required in order to effect such perfection.
 
7)           Title.  The related Borrower under each Mortgage Loan has good and indefeasible fee simple or, if representation (25) hereof is applicable to such Mortgage Loan, leasehold title to the related Mortgaged Property comprising real estate, subject to Permitted Encumbrances, if any.
 
8)           Title Insurance.  The Seller has received an American Land Title Association (ALTA) lender’s title insurance policy or a comparable form of lender’s title insurance policy (or escrow instructions binding on the Title Insurer (as defined below) 
 


 


D-2





 

 
and irrevocably obligating the Title Insurer to issue such title insurance policy or a title policy commitment or pro-forma “marked up” at the closing of the related Mortgage Loan and countersigned or otherwise approved by the Title Insurer or its authorized agent) as adopted in the applicable jurisdiction (the “Title Insurance Policy”), which was issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company (the “Title Insurer”) qualified to do business in the jurisdiction where the applicable Mortgaged Property is located (unless such jurisdiction is the State of Iowa), covering the portion of each Mortgaged Property comprised of real estate and insuring that the related Mortgage is a valid first lien in the original principal amount of the related Mortgage Loan on the Borrower’s fee simple interest (or, if applicable, leasehold interest) in such Mortgaged Property comprised of real estate, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances.  Such Title Insurance Policy was issued in connection with the origination of the related Mortgage Loan. No claims have been made under such Title Insurance Policy.  Such Title Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and all premiums thereon have been paid and will provide that the insured includes the owner of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and/or assigns. No holder of the related Mortgage has done, by act or omission, anything that would, and the Seller has no actual knowledge of any other circumstance that would, impair the coverage under such Title Insurance Policy.  Such Title Insurance Policy contains no exception regarding the encroachment upon any material easements of any material permanent improvements located at the Mortgaged Property for which the grantee of such easement has the ability to force removal of such improvement, or such Title Insurance Policy affirmatively insures (unless the related Mortgaged Property is located in a jurisdiction where such affirmative insurance is not available) against losses caused by forced removal of any material permanent improvements on the related Mortgaged Property that encroach upon any material easements.

 
9)           Valid Assignment.  The related Assignment of Mortgage and the related assignment of the Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits executed in connection with each Mortgage, if any, have been recorded in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if not recorded, have been submitted for recording or are in recordable form (but for the insertion of the name and address of the assignee and any related recording information which is not yet available to the Seller)) and constitute the legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage and the related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits from the Seller to the Purchaser.  The endorsement of the related Note by the Seller constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable (except as such enforcement may be limited by anti-deficiency laws or bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)) assignment of such Note, and together with such Assignment of Mortgage and the related assignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, legally and validly conveys all right, title and interest in such Mortgage Loan and Loan Documents to the Purchaser.
 
10)         Nonrecourse.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan is non-recourse to the related parties thereto except that the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity shall be fully liable for actual losses, liabilities, costs and damages arising from certain acts of the related Borrower and/or its

principals specified in the related Loan Documents, which acts generally include the following: (i) acts of fraud or intentional material misrepresentation, (ii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, (iii)  material physical waste of the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) any breach of the environmental covenants contained in the related Loan Documents.
 
11)           Mortgage Provisions.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, non-judicial foreclosure, and there is no exemption available to the related Borrower which would interfere with such right of foreclosure except any statutory right of redemption or as may be limited by anti-deficiency or one form of action laws or by bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
12)           Enforceability.  Each of the related Notes and Mortgages are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the related Borrower named on the Mortgage Loan Schedule and each of the other related Loan Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto (subject to any non-recourse provisions therein), enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by anti-deficiency or one form of action laws or bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that certain provisions of such Loan Documents are or may be unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable state or federal laws, but the inclusion of such provisions does not render any of the Loan Documents invalid as a whole, and such Loan Documents taken as a whole are enforceable to the extent necessary and customary for the practical realization of the principal rights and benefits afforded thereby.
 
13)           Modifications.  Neither the terms of the Mortgage Loans nor the related Loan Documents have been altered, impaired, modified or waived in any material respect, except prior to the Cut-off Date by written instrument duly submitted for recordation, to the extent required, and as specifically set forth in the related Mortgage File and posted on the website or otherwise made available to the Controlling Class Representative, and no such alterations, impairments, modifications, or waivers have been completed or consented to after the Cut-off Date.
 
14)           Deed of Trust.  With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or may be substituted in accordance with applicable law, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection with a trustee’s sale after default by the Borrower and fees paid in 
 


 


D-4

15)           Releases. Except by a written instrument that has been delivered to the Purchaser as a part of the related Mortgage File with respect to any immaterial releases of the Mortgaged Property, no Mortgage Loan has been satisfied, canceled, subordinated, released or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the related Borrower has not been released, in whole or in part, from its obligations under any related Loan Document.
 
16)           No Offset.  Except with respect to the enforceability of any provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees, additional interest, prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges, neither the Mortgage Loan nor any of the related Loan Documents is subject to any right of rescission, set-off, abatement, diminution, valid counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of any such Loan Documents, or the exercise (in compliance with procedures permitted under applicable law) of any right thereunder, render any Loan Documents subject to any right of rescission, set-off, abatement, diminution, valid counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury (subject to anti-deficiency or one form of action laws and to bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor’s rights generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)), and no such right of rescission, set-off, abatement, diminution, valid counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto.
 
17)           No Material Default.  As of the Closing Date, there is no payment default, after giving effect to any applicable notice and/or grace period, and, to the Seller’s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, there is no other material default under any of the related Loan Documents, after giving effect to any applicable notice and/or grace period; no such material default or breach has been waived by the Seller or on its behalf or, to the Seller’s knowledge, by the Seller’s predecessors in interest with respect to the Mortgage Loans; and, to the Seller’s actual knowledge, no event has occurred which, with the passing of time or giving of notice would constitute a material default or breach; provided, however, that the representations and warranties set forth in this sentence do not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of any subject matter otherwise covered by any other representation or warranty made hereunder by the Seller.  No Mortgage Loan has been accelerated and no foreclosure proceeding or power of sale proceeding has been initiated under the terms of the related Loan Documents.  The Seller has not waived any material claims against the related Borrower under any non-recourse exceptions contained in the Note.
 
18)           No Future Advances.  The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date (except for certain amounts that were fully disbursed by the mortgagee, but were escrowed pursuant to the terms of the related Loan Documents) and there are no future advances required to be made by the mortgagee under any of the related Loan Documents.  Any requirements under the related Loan Documents regarding the completion of any on-site

or off-site improvements and to disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been or are being complied with or such escrow funds are still being held.  The Seller has not, nor, to the Seller’s knowledge, have any of its agents or predecessors in interest with respect to the Mortgage Loan, in respect of payments due on the related Note or Mortgage, directly or indirectly, advanced funds or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds by a party other than the Borrower other than (a) interest accruing on such Mortgage Loan from the date of such disbursement of such Mortgage Loan to the date which preceded by thirty (30) days the first payment date under the related Note and (b) application and commitment fees, escrow funds, points and reimbursements for fees and expenses, incurred in connection with the origination and funding of the Mortgage Loan.

exercised, and will be enforceable, by the mortgagee or its assignee) which extends not less than 20 years beyond the stated maturity date of the related Mortgage Loan;
 
viii)           under the terms of such Ground Lease and the related Mortgage, taken together, any related insurance proceeds will be applied either to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property, with the mortgagee under such Mortgage or a financially responsible institution acting as trustee appointed by it, or consented to by it, or by the lessor having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses (except in such cases where a provision entitling another party to hold and disburse such proceeds would not be viewed as commercially unreasonable by a prudent commercial mortgage lender), or to the payment in whole or in part of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; and
 
ix)           such Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting which would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Seller; such Ground Lease contains a covenant (or applicable laws provide) that the lessor thereunder is not permitted, in the absence of an uncured default, to disturb the possession, interest or quiet enjoyment of any lessee in the relevant portion of such Mortgaged Property subject to such Ground Lease for any reason, or in any manner, which would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage.
 
26)           Environmental Matters.  Except for those Mortgage Loans set forth on Annex A hereto for which a lender’s environmental insurance policy was obtained in lieu of an Environmental Site Assessment, an Environmental Site Assessment relating to each Mortgaged Property prepared no earlier than 12 months prior to the Closing Date was obtained and reviewed by the Seller in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, and a copy is included in the Servicing File.
 
i)           Such Environmental Site Assessment does not identify, and the Seller has no actual knowledge of, any adverse circumstances or conditions with respect to or affecting the Mortgaged Property that would constitute or result in a material violation of any Environmental Laws, except for such circumstances or conditions (i) which are covered by environmental insurance policies (as set forth on Annex A hereto) maintained with respect to the Mortgaged Property, or (ii) as to which, if any expenditure greater than 5% of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan is required in order to achieve or maintain compliance in all material respects with any Environmental Laws, adequate sums, equal to at least 125% of the estimate of the total amount of such expenditures as set forth in the Environmental Site Assessment, were reserved in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, and as to which the related Borrower has covenanted to perform the actions necessary to achieve or maintain compliance in all material respects with any Environmental Laws, or (iii) as to which the related Borrower or one of its affiliates is currently taking or required to take such actions 
 


 


D-10





 


 
(which may be the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan), if any, as recommended by the Environmental Site Assessment or required by the applicable governmental authority, or (iv) as to which a responsible party not related to the Borrower with assets reasonably estimated by the Seller at the time of origination to be sufficient to effect all necessary or required remediation identified in a notice or other action from the applicable governmental authority is currently taking or required to take such actions, if any, with respect to such regulatory authority’s order or directive, or (v) which, if recommended in the Environmental Site Assessment, were investigated further and, based upon such additional investigation, as to which an environmental consultant recommended no further investigation or remediation, or (vi) as to which a party with financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to cure the condition or circumstance provided a guaranty or an indemnity to the related Borrower or to the mortgagee to cover the costs of any required investigation, testing, monitoring or remediation, or (vii) as to which the related Borrower or other responsible party obtained a “No Further Action” letter or other evidence reasonably acceptable to a prudent commercial mortgage lender that applicable federal, state, or local governmental authorities had no current intention of taking any action, and are not requiring any action, in respect of such condition or circumstance, or (viii) which would not require substantial cleanup, remedial action or other extraordinary response under any Environmental Laws reasonably estimated to cost in excess of 5% of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan.
 
ii)           To the Seller’s actual knowledge and in reliance upon the Environmental Site Assessment, except for any Hazardous Materials being handled in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws and except for any Hazardous Materials present at such Mortgaged Property for which, to the extent that an Environmental Site Assessment recommends remediation or other action, (A) there is either (i) environmental insurance with respect to such Mortgaged Property (as set forth on Annex A hereto) or (ii) an amount in an escrow account pledged as security for such Mortgage Loan under the relevant Loan Documents equal to no less than 125% of the amount estimated in such Environmental Site Assessment as sufficient to pay the cost of such remediation or other action in accordance with such Environmental Site Assessment or (B) one of the statements set forth in representation (26)(i) above is true, (1) such Mortgaged Property is not being used for the treatment or disposal of Hazardous Materials; (2) no Hazardous Materials are being used or stored or generated for off-site disposal or otherwise present at such Mortgaged Property other than Hazardous Materials of such types and in such quantities as are customarily used or stored or generated for off-site disposal or otherwise present in or at properties of the relevant property type; and (3) such Mortgaged Property is not subject to any environmental hazard (including, without limitation, any situation involving Hazardous Materials) which under the Environmental Laws would have to be eliminated before the sale of, or which could otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely affect in more than a de minimis manner the value or marketability of, such Mortgaged Property.
 


 


D-11





 


 
iii)           The related Mortgage or other Loan Documents contain covenants on the part of the related Borrower requiring its compliance with any present or future federal, state and local Environmental Laws and regulations in connection with the Mortgaged Property.  The related Borrower (or an affiliate thereof) has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold the Seller, and its successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, expenses and claims of whatever kind or nature (including attorneys’ fees and costs) imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any such party resulting from a breach of the environmental representations, warranties or covenants given by the related Borrower in connection with such Mortgage Loan.
 
iv)           Each of the Mortgage Loans covered by a lender’s environmental insurance policy obtained in lieu of an Environmental Site Assessment (“In Lieu of Policy”) is identified on Annex A hereto and has a term ending no sooner than the date which is two years after the maturity date of the related Mortgage Loan, is non-cancelable by the insurer during such term and the premium for such policy has been paid in full.  All environmental assessments or updates that were in the possession of the Seller and that relate to a Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A hereto as being insured by an In Lieu of Policy have been delivered to or disclosed to the In Lieu of Policy carrier issuing such policy prior to the issuance of such policy.
 
27)           Insurance.  As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan, and, as of the Closing Date, the Mortgaged Property is covered by insurance policies providing the coverage described below and the Loan Documents permit the mortgagee to require the coverage described below.  All premiums with respect to the insurance policies insuring each Mortgaged Property have been paid in a timely manner or escrowed to the extent required by the Loan Documents, and the Seller has not received (1) any notice of non-payment of premiums that has not been cured in a timely manner by the related Borrower or (2) any notice of cancellation or termination of such insurance policies.  The relevant Servicing File contains the insurance policy required for such Mortgage Loan or a certificate of insurance for such insurance policy.  Each Mortgage or Loan Agreement requires that the related Mortgaged Property and all improvements thereon are covered by insurance policies providing (a) coverage in an amount at least equal to the lesser of full replacement cost of such Mortgaged Property and the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan (subject to customary deductibles) for losses sustained by fire and for losses or damages from other risks and hazards covered by a standard extended coverage insurance policy providing “special form” coverage in an amount sufficient to prevent the Borrower from being deemed a co-insurer and to provide coverage on a full replacement cost basis of such Mortgaged Property (in some cases, full replacement excludes excavations, underground utilities, foundations and footings) with an agreed amount endorsement to avoid application of any coinsurance provision; such policy contains a standard mortgagee clause naming the mortgagee and its successor in interest as additional insureds or loss payee, as applicable; and such policy contains no provisions for a deduction for depreciation, except that the policy may permit a deduction for depreciation in connection with a cash settlement after a casualty if the insurance proceeds are not being applied to rebuild or repair the damaged 
 


 


D-12





 


 
improvements; (b) business interruption or rental loss insurance in an amount at least equal to (i) 12 months of operations or (ii) in some cases all rents and other amounts customarily insured under this type of insurance of the Mortgaged Property; (c) flood insurance, if any portion of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, on the Mortgaged Property is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with respect to other Mortgage Loans, as having special flood hazards, to the extent flood insurance is available; (d) workers’ compensation, if required by law; and (e) comprehensive general liability insurance in an amount not less than $1 million.  All such insurance policies referred to in the prior sentence that are currently in place contain clauses providing they are not terminable and may not be terminated without thirty (30) days prior written notice to the mortgagee (except where applicable law requires a shorter period or except for nonpayment of premiums, in which case not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the mortgagee is required).  In addition, each Mortgage and/or Loan Agreement permits the related mortgagee to make premium payments to prevent the cancellation of such insurance policies with respect to the Mortgaged Property and shall entitle such mortgagee to reimbursement therefor.  Any insurance proceeds in respect of a casualty loss or taking will be applied either to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property or the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.  If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, such Mortgaged Property is insured by windstorm insurance in an amount at least equal to the lesser of (i) the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan, and (ii) 100% of the full insurable value, or 100% of the replacement cost, of the improvements located on the related Mortgaged Property.  The related Mortgaged Property is insured by an insurance policy, issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of such Mortgage Loan and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least “A-:V” from A.M. Best Company or “A-” (or the equivalent) from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Fitch, Inc. or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.  An architectural or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the probable maximum loss (“PML”) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake.  In such instance, the PML was based on a 450 or 475 year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance.  If the resulting report concluded that the PML would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance for such Mortgaged Property was obtained from an insurer rated at least “A-:V” by A.M. Best Company or “A-” (or the equivalent) from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Fitch, Inc. or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.  To the Seller’s actual knowledge, the insurer issuing each of the foregoing insurance policies is qualified to write insurance in the jurisdiction where the related Mortgaged Property is located.
 
28)           Escrows.  All amounts required to be deposited by each Borrower at origination under the related Loan Documents have been deposited or have been withheld from the related Mortgage Loan proceeds at origination and there are no deficiencies with 
 


 


D-13





 


 
regard thereto.  All escrow deposits and payments required by the terms of each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control of the Seller (except to the extent they have been disbursed for their intended purposes), and all amounts required to be deposited by the applicable Borrower under the related Loan Documents have been deposited, and there are no deficiencies with regard thereto (subject to any applicable notice and cure period).  All of the Seller’s interest in such escrows and deposits will be conveyed by the Seller to the Purchaser hereunder.
 
29)           Litigation.  To the Seller’s knowledge, with respect to each Mortgage Loan, as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan, and, to the Seller’s actual knowledge, with respect to each Mortgage Loan, as of the Closing Date, there are no actions, suits, arbitrations or governmental investigations or proceedings by or before any court or other governmental authority or agency now pending against or affecting the Borrower under any Mortgage Loan or any of the Mortgaged Properties which, if determined against such Borrower or such Mortgaged Property, would materially and adversely affect the value of such Mortgaged Property, the security intended to be provided with respect to the related Mortgage Loan, or the ability of such Borrower and/or the current use of such Mortgaged Property to generate net cash flow to pay principal, interest and other amounts due under the related Mortgage Loan; and to the Seller’s actual knowledge there are no such actions, suits or proceedings threatened against such Borrower.
 
30)           Servicing.  The servicing and collection practices used by Seller in respect of each Mortgage Loan have been in all material respect legal, proper and prudent, in accordance with customary commercial mortgage servicing practices.
 
31)           Inspection.  The originator of the Mortgage Loan or the Seller has inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within the 12 months prior to the Closing Date.
 
32)           Financial Reporting.  The Loan Documents require the Borrower to provide the holder of the Mortgage Loan with at least the following: annual operating statements, financial statements and, except for Mortgage Loans for which the related Mortgaged Property is leased to a single tenant or is a multifamily or similar property, rent rolls.
 
33)           Related Borrowers.  No two or more Mortgage Loans representing, in the aggregate, more than 5% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all the Mortgage Loans included in the Trust Fund have the same Borrower or, to the Seller’s knowledge, are to Borrowers which are entities controlled by one another or under common control.
 
34)           Single Purpose Entity.  Each Borrower with respect to a Mortgage Loan with a principal balance as of the Cut-off Date in excess of $15,000,000 included in the Trust Fund is an entity whose organizational documents or related Loan Documents provide that it is, and at least so long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding will continue to be, a Single Purpose Entity.  For this purpose, “Single Purpose Entity” shall mean a 
 


 


D-14





 


 
Person, other than an individual, whose organizational documents or related Loan Documents provide that it shall engage solely in the business of owning and operating the Mortgaged Property and which does not engage in any business unrelated to such property and the financing thereof, does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in the Mortgaged Property or the financing thereof or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage or the other Loan Documents, and the organizational documents of which require that it have its own separate books and records and its own accounts, in each case which are separate and apart from the books and records and accounts of any other Person.
 
35)           REMIC.  The Mortgage Loan is a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined without regard to the rule in Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages) and, accordingly, (A) the gross proceeds of the Mortgage Loan to the related Borrower at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either:  (a) such Mortgage Loan is secured by an interest in real property (including land, buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan on such date; provided that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b) substantially all the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third party credit enhancement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)).  If the Mortgage Loan was “significantly modified” prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause (a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause (B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto.  Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute “customary prepayment penalties” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(2).
 
36)           Due-on-Sale or Encumbrance.  Each of the Mortgage Loans contains a “due-on-sale” clause, which provides for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan if, without the prior written consent of the holder of the Mortgage Loan, the property subject to the Mortgage, or any controlling interest therein, is directly or indirectly transferred or sold (except that it may provide for transfers by devise, descent or operation of law upon the death of a member, manager, general partner or shareholder of a Borrower and that it may provide for transfers subject to the Mortgage Loan holder’s approval of transferee, transfers of worn out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality, transfers of leases entered into in accordance with the Loan 
 


 


D-15





 


 
Documents, transfers to affiliates, transfers to family members for estate planning purposes, transfers among existing members, partners or shareholders in Borrowers or transfers of passive interests so long as the key principals or general partner retains control).  The Loan Documents contain a “due-on-encumbrance” clause, which provides for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan if the property subject to the Mortgage or any controlling interest in the Borrower is further pledged or encumbered, unless the prior written consent of the holder of the Mortgage Loan is obtained (except that it may provide for assignments subject to the Mortgage Loan holder’s approval of transferee, transfers to affiliates or transfers of passive interests so long as the key principals or general partner retains control).  The Mortgage or Note requires the Borrower to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with securing the consent or approval of the holder of the Mortgage for a waiver of a “due-on-sale” or “due-on-encumbrance” clause or a defeasance provision.
 
37)           Defeasance.  Each Mortgage Loan containing provisions for defeasance of mortgage collateral provides that defeasance may not occur any earlier than two years after the Closing Date, and further requires or provides that: (i) the replacement collateral consist of U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii), in an amount sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Note when due (up to the maturity date for the related Mortgage Loan or the date on which the Borrower may prepay the related Mortgage Loan without payment of any prepayment penalty); (ii) the Mortgage Loan may be assumed by a Single Purpose Entity approved by the holder of the Mortgage Loan; (iii) counsel provide an opinion that the trustee has a perfected security interest in the collateral prior to any other claim or interest; and (iv) the related Borrower must deliver, or cause delivery of, such other documents and certifications as the mortgagee may reasonably require which may include, without limitation, (A) a certification that the purpose of the defeasance is to facilitate the disposition of the mortgaged real property or any other customary commercial transaction and not to be part of an arrangement to collateralize a REMIC offering with obligations that are not real estate mortgages and (B) a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Note when due.  Each Mortgage Loan containing provisions for defeasance provides that, in addition to any cost associated with defeasance, the related Borrower shall pay, as of the date the mortgage collateral is defeased, all scheduled and accrued interest and principal due as well as an amount sufficient to defease in full the Mortgage Loan (except as contemplated in representation (38) hereof). In addition, if the related Mortgage Loan permits defeasance, then the Loan Documents provide that the related Borrower shall (x) pay all reasonable fees associated with the defeasance of the Mortgage Loan and all other reasonable expenses associated with the defeasance, or (y) provide all opinions required under the related Loan Documents, and in the case of any Mortgage Loan with an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $40,000,000 or greater, (a) a REMIC opinion and (b) a No Downgrade Confirmation.
 
38)           Release of Property.  The terms of the related Loan Documents do not permit the release of any portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the 
 


 


D-16





 


 
Mortgage except in compliance with REMIC Provisions and only (i) in consideration of payment in full (or in certain cases in which partial prepayment is permitted, in an amount equal to no less than 125% of the Allocated Loan Amount) therefor, (ii) in connection with the substitution of all or a portion of the Mortgaged Property in exchange for delivery of U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii), in a defeasance meeting the requirements of representation (37) hereof, provided that in the case of a partial defeasance, the portion of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan secured by the defeasance collateral is not less than 125% of the Allocated Loan Amount, (iii) where such portion to be released was not considered material for purposes of underwriting the Mortgage Loan or the appraisal obtained at origination of the Mortgage Loan and such release was contemplated at origination, (iv) conditioned on the satisfaction of certain underwriting and other requirements, including payment of a release price in an amount equal to not less than 125% of the Allocated Loan Amount for such Mortgaged Property or the portion thereof to be released or (v) as set forth on Schedule D-2 to this Exhibit D, in connection with the substitution of a replacement property in compliance with REMIC Provisions; provided that, in the case of clauses (i), (iii) and (iv), for any Mortgage Loan originated after December 6, 2010, if the fair market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal amount of the Mortgage Loan outstanding after the release, the Borrower is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions, unless the Borrower delivers an opinion of counsel to the effect that the failure to make that payment will not cause any REMIC that holds the Mortgage Loan to cease to be a REMIC.
 
39)           Commercial Property.  Each Mortgaged Property is owned by the related Borrower, except for Mortgaged Properties which are secured in whole or in a part by a Ground Lease and for out-parcels, and is used and occupied for commercial or multifamily residential purposes in accordance with applicable law.
 
40)           Casualty.  In the event of casualty or destruction of the Mortgaged Property, any non-conformity with applicable zoning laws as of the origination date will not prohibit the Mortgaged Property from being restored or repaired in all material respects, to the use or structure at the time of such casualty, except for restrictions on its use or rebuildability for which (i) law and ordinance insurance coverage has been obtained in amounts consistent with the standards utilized by the Seller or (ii) the Title Insurance Policy insures against such non-conformity.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, it is understood that any change to the use or structure of the Mortgaged Property which materially and adversely affects the related Borrower’s ability to timely make payments on the related Mortgage Loan shall be deemed to be a material change to such use or structure.
 
41)           Capital Contribution; Construction.  Neither the Seller nor any affiliate thereof has any obligation to make any capital contributions to the related Borrower under the Mortgage Loan.  The Mortgage Loan was not originated for the sole purpose of financing the construction of incomplete improvements on the related Mortgaged Property.
 


 


D-17





 


 
42)           No Fraud.  No court of competent jurisdiction will determine in a final decree that fraud with respect to the Mortgage Loans has taken place on the part of the Seller or, to the Seller’s actual knowledge, on the part of any originator, in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan.
 
43)           Grace Periods.  If the related Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide for a grace period for delinquent Monthly Payments, such grace period is no longer than ten (10) days from the applicable payment date.
 
44)           Access.  The following statements are true with respect to the related Mortgaged Property:  (a) the Mortgaged Property is located on or adjacent to a dedicated road or has access to an irrevocable easement permitting ingress and egress and (b) the Mortgaged Property is served by public or private utilities, water and sewer (or septic facilities)  appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property.
 
45)           Terrorism Insurance.  None of the Loan Documents contain any provision that expressly excuses the related borrower from obtaining and maintaining insurance coverage for acts of terrorism or, in circumstances where terrorism insurance is not expressly required, the mortgagee is not prohibited from requesting that the related borrower maintain such insurance, in each case, to the extent such insurance coverage is generally available for like properties in such jurisdictions at commercially reasonable rates.  Each Mortgaged Property is insured by a “standard extended coverage” casualty insurance policy that does not contain an express exclusion for (or, alternatively, is covered by a separate policy that insures against property damage resulting from) acts of terrorism.
 
46)           Appraisal.  An appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property was conducted in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, and such appraisal contained a statement, or was accompanied by a letter from the appraiser, to the effect that the appraisal was performed in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as in effect on the date such Mortgage Loan  was originated.
 
47)           Condemnation.  In the case of any Mortgage Loan originated after December 6, 2010, in the event of a taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property by the United States, a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof, whether by legal proceeding or by agreement, the Borrower is required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in an amount required by the REMIC Provisions, and such amount may not be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Borrower, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration), the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, unless the Borrower delivers an opinion of counsel to the effect that the failure to make that payment will not cause any REMIC that holds the Mortgage Loan to cease to be a REMIC.
 


 


D-18





 


 
48)           Release of Cross-Collateralization.  In the case of any Mortgage Loan originated after December 6, 2010, no such Mortgage Loan that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized with another Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties, other than in compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
 
Defined Terms:
 
The term “Allocated Loan Amount” shall mean, for each Mortgaged Property, the portion of principal of the related Mortgage Loan allocated to such Mortgaged Property for certain purposes (including determining the release prices of properties, if permitted) under such Mortgage Loan as set forth in the related Loan Documents.  There can be no assurance, and it is unlikely, that the Allocated Loan Amounts represent the current values of individual Mortgaged Properties, the price at which an individual Mortgaged Property could be sold in the future to a willing buyer or the replacement cost of the Mortgaged Properties.
 
The term “Environmental Site Assessment” shall mean a Phase I environmental report meeting the requirements of the American Society for Testing and Materials, and, if in accordance with customary industry standards a reasonable lender would require it, a Phase II environmental report, each prepared by a licensed third party professional experienced in environmental matters.

(i)           the Seller has examined and relied in whole or in part upon one or more of the specified documents or other information in connection with a given representation or warranty;
 
(ii)          that the information contained in such document or otherwise obtained by the Seller appears on its face to be consistent in all material respects with the substance of such representation or warranty;
 
(iii)         the Seller’s reliance on such document or other information is consistent with the standard of care exercised by prudent lending institutions originating commercial mortgage loans; and
 
(iv)         although the Seller is under no obligation to verify independently the information contained in any document specified as being relied upon by it, the Seller believes the information contained therein to be true, accurate and complete in all material respects and has no actual knowledge of any facts or circumstances which would render reliance thereon unjustified without further inquiry.
 
The term “Mortgage Interest Rate” shall mean the fixed rate of interest per annum that each Mortgage Loan bears as of the Cut-off Date.
 


 


D-19





 


 
The term “Permitted Encumbrances” shall mean:
 
(i)           the lien of current real property taxes, ground rents, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet delinquent or accruing interest or penalties;
 
(ii)          covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally and exceptions and exclusions referred to in the related mortgagee’s title insurance policy;
 
(iii)         other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; and
 
(iv)         the rights of tenants, as tenants only, whether under ground leases or space leases at the Mortgaged Property;
 
which together do not materially and adversely affect the related Borrower’s ability to timely make payments on the related Mortgage Loan, which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided by the related Mortgage or the use, for the use currently being made, the operation as currently being operated, enjoyment, value or marketability of such Mortgaged Property, provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Permitted Encumbrances shall exclude all pari passu, second, junior and subordinated mortgages.
 
The term “UCC Financing Statement” shall mean a financing statement prepared and filed pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction.
 
Other.  For purposes of these representations and warranties, the term “to the Seller’s knowledge” shall mean that no officer, employee or agent of the Seller responsible for the underwriting, origination or sale of the Mortgage Loans or of any servicer responsible for servicing the Mortgage Loan on behalf of the Seller, believes that a given representation or warranty is not true or is inaccurate based upon the Seller’s reasonable inquiry, and that during the course of such inquiry, no such officer, employee or agent of the Seller has obtained any actual knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause such Person to believe that such representation or warranty was inaccurate.  Furthermore, all information contained in documents which are part of or required to be part of a Mortgage File shall be deemed to be within the Seller’s knowledge.  For purposes of these representations and warranties, the term “to the Seller’s actual knowledge” shall mean that an officer, employee or agent of the Seller responsible for the underwriting, origination and sale of the Mortgage Loans does not actually know of any facts or circumstances that would cause such Person to believe that such representation or warranty was inaccurate.
 
It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in this Exhibit D shall survive delivery of the respective Mortgage Files to the Purchaser and/or the Trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser and its successors and assigns (including without limitation the Trustee and the holders of the Certificates), notwithstanding any restrictive or qualified endorsement or assignment.

The Unit Owners have given a mortgage on the unit to lender and made a variety of representations and covenants in the Loan Documents with respect to the unit, but they are not technically considered Borrowers under the Mortgage Loan, so any representation being made regarding ownership of the Mortgaged Property by the Borrower should also include the Unit Owners.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

Loan Type:
Home Purchase
Home Refinance








Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Mortgage Balance:




Home Type:
Single Family
Town House
Condo
Multifamily
Co-op



Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 27, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper rise, a holding steady, or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including:

This morning's domestic economic data – Durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected, though the former figure was inflated by one-time orders for aircraft. Meanwhile, the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing.


The U.S. Treasury will be auctioning 7-year notes at 1:00 pm (ET).
Skittishness ahead of tomorrow's announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for 2017's second quarter.
Events on Capitol Hill as the U.S. Senate continues to debate health care reform. To some, the credibility of President Trump's wider business and tax agenda is at stake.

If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages inched down yesterday, giving some relief after Tuesday's sharp rise. They remain close to where they were between July 12-18. Rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

There’s a mortgage product to meet almost any need
From first-time buyer programs to reverse mortgages to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), today’s lenders offer products that allow borrowers to:

Buy property with a low (or no) down payment
Build a house
Exchange home equity for cash
Purchase rental housing
Refinance to a better interest rate
Supplement monthly income
Renovate their residences











 



Types of mortgage programs
Consumers should discuss their options with mortgage lenders to come up with the program that best meets their needs. Home mortgages can be classified in several ways:

Fixed rate or adjustable rate
Conforming or jumbo loan amount
Government or conventional
Purchase or refinance
Prime or sub-prime
Traditional (forward) or reverse
Construction or permanent
First or second mortgage
















What to do before applying for a mortgage loan?
Once they have selected a program, borrowers should compare mortgage rates and terms. That’s easy to do online with sites like LendingTree.com. When comparing mortgage programs, consumers should get the same information from each lender. This includes interest rate, duration of interest rate (Does it adjust? When? By how much?), loan term (15 year, 30 year, etc.), lender fees and 3rd party charges, APR, features like interest-only payments or prepayment penalties, and mortgage insurance or funding fees.
It’s important when shopping for a mortgage to get all home loan quotes at approximately the same time. Mortgage interest rates change constantly, because they are affected by the prices of bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are bought and sold like stocks. Global economic news, Treasury auctions and decisions by the Federal Reserve can cause mortgage rates to move up and down very suddenly. Just as stock prices change all day long, so can mortgage rates. This means a quote from Lender A on Monday can’t reliably be compared to one from Lender B on Wednesday. LendingTree allows consumers to easily compare real-time quotes from competing mortgage lenders, helping them make informed choices and save money.

HARP Loan















Advertorial






 (877) 792-9388







Toggle nav


What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).






Connect with us
The licensed lending officer will also explain all the steps–from getting started, to locking in your low rate, to closing your loan quickly. Because we are a direct lender, if you have any questions during the loan process,
                                you will have one direct number enabling you to get quick answers straight from the source.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
