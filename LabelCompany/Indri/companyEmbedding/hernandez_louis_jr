CEO Louis Hernandez, Jr.Jim ProbascoBenzingaMay 13, 2015ReblogShareTweetShare“We're trying to solve a bigger problem. It's not just an editor, audio, storage or marketing. It's actually the whole thing that's the business problem,” Avid Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVID) CEO Louis Hernandez, Jr. explained to Benzinga in part two of a two-part series.Previously in part one, Hernandez talked about his plan to turn the former video and audio production technology giant around as it rejoined the NASDAQ following its delisting in February 2014.In part two, Hernandez discusses Avid Everywhere, the company's vision for the future of the media industry.BZ: How is media production changing in the industry?LH: The creative side of the workflow is now fusing with the monetization side. The unintended consequence is that content creation demand is going up, but budgets are only going up slightly.Budgets for technology are going up three times as much as budgets on content creation side. Budgets are shifting from creative professionals over to monetizing.Related Link: Avid Congratulates Its Customers On Their AchievementsBZ: What solutions to this problem does Avid propose?LH: Many of the steps to monetizing can be done during creation. We're trying to put all of those activities onto what we call the Avid Media Central Platform.We put together all the shared services you would have – anything you'd like to do. This is like iOS on the iPhone. It is the underlying operating system upon which you can put applications.BZ: How does the Avid Media Central Platform work?LH: "Search across your entire network" means if you connect Media Composer, Adobe and Apple, this shared application service will allow you to search all your editorial suites for a piece of media regardless if it's our application or somebody else's.For specific tasks, like resolution independence, instead of having each application solve that problem for you, any application that sits on top – whether it is Adobe's or ours – can use that capability.Instead of forcing clients to connect all the pieces, we allow application providers to connect directly to the operating system so their plug-ins always work.When they upgrade – or we upgrade – we'll know whether the connection works ahead of time.Related Link: Zebra Technologies Tops Q1 ExpectationsBZ: How are applications organized on the platform?LH: Applications are broken down into suites, which share that common OS.Adobe, for example, fits into the Artists Suite. Any application certified, using the Connectivity Toolkit can sit on top of the Avid Media Central Platform (OS).The Media Suite consists of all the things you should do concurrently, but most people do after they create the asset. That includes metadata tagging, protecting the asset, asset management and so forth.Other suites include Storage and Marketplace. Using the Marketplace, for example, you can invite people from there – using Collaboration Services – to work on a common section.BZ: What about pricing?LH: In the past, we didn't price our package in a way for the individual user to use easily. Now we do.You can now get the best (Avid) priced and packaged in a way that is affordable. If you can get the same product for the same price as Adobe or an equivalent package but that won every major Oscar and ACE award, why wouldn't you?BZ: More specifically, does pricing now include a subscription package?LH: We recently launched subscription for Media Composer and came back and launched it for Pro Tools.Then we kind of shocked everyone. Under Artist Suite – First Entry – these are going to be the first free versions of our Artist Suite.Related Link: The 2015 Benzinga Fintech Award WinnersBZ: So, users can now get entry-level versions of Avid applications free?LH: Correct. The first one we announced was Pro Tools. It's an entry point product, but the same platform with some limitations.Eventually, users can migrate up to $29.95/month or outright ownership as needed.BZ: How will the new Avid platform address the educational community?LH: Avid is very strong in many of the traditional educational institutions because that's what is expected out in the real world. Anybody aspiring to be a professional is going to be taught on Avid.What we didn't have (in the past) was individual pricing for K-12 or an individual school that may want to use it.Read MoreWe just entered into partnership with 45 different universities around the First product. School systems will join because they can incorporate the most broadly used software in the world free.Related Link: Avid Enters Into a Definitive Agreement to Acquire Orad Hi-Tec Systems for EUR5.67 Per ShareBZ: So, in a way, Avid Everywhere is also Avid for Everyone – at least in media production?LH: We've started to recognize that there are three basic kinds of users. There's the individual, which we want to connect to the entire ecosystem; there are creative teams; and there are large media enterprises.Avid Media Central Platform is designed to allow all three kinds of users to interact and collaborate.That's where we're going to capture the imagination of the next generation.At the time of this writing, Jim Probasco had no position in any mentioned securities.Image Credit: "2015 NAMM Show - DSC00594 (16183306800)" by Pete Brown from Gambrills, MD, USA - DSC00594.

Meet the New CEO of Avid: Q&A with Louis Herndandez, Jr. on the Future of Pro Tools

There’s no official President of Pro Audio, but the CEO who runs Avid comes closest to holding that title. Just like the President of the United States is often referred to as the Leader of the Free World, the person who runs the Burlington, MA-based media technology company has responsibilities transcending their job description.
Louis Hernandez, Jr. is the new CEO of Avid.
When Avid was founded in 1987, there was nothing to suggest that it would become the steward of the world’s most ubiquitous audio hardware/software systems. At the time, the company was a pioneering creator of nonlinear editing (NLE) systems for film and TV editors – the sound business wasn’t even a twinkle in its eye as it built its digital video editing system, Media Composer, into its own category killer.
But when Avid acquired Digidesign in 1995, audio quickly became a core competency. As everyone knows, Digidesign’s Pro Tools system handily won the DAW war and became the industry standard music production and editing system worldwide, from recording studios to audio post. Its 2006 purchase of Sibelius built on its foundation within the segment via ownership of a top notation software solution in use by composers everywhere. Meanwhile, the M-Audio line has come and gone from Avid’s portfolio.
Overseeing all of this, as of Monday, February 11th, 2013, is a new CEO for Avid: Louis Hernandez, Jr. His installment by the Avid board stands as a welcome chance to begin a new era for the diversified media company, which endured waves of layoffs and a steadily sinking stock price under their former CEO, Gary Greenfield. Consumer confidence in the company has dipped in kind during Greenfield’s five-year-plus term, as everything from poor customer relations to concerns about Avid’s long-term prospects deeply disturbed its audio user base.
Hernandez’ appointment just may provide Pro Tools customers everywhere with reason to hope, however. A longtime board member of Avid, Hernandez became available when the company that he previously headed, the financial technology provider Open Solutions, was acquired this past January at a valuation of $1.15 billion.
While he may be good at generating value for stockholders, Hernandez understands there’s more at stake with his newfound duties. A live music fan and aficionado of the likes of Trombone Shorty, Hernandez stresses early and often that he truly connects with the experience of sound. As the new de facto President of Pro Audio, he’s looking to facilitate the same for a lot of people, far into the future.
Our conversation with Louis Hernandez, Jr., CEO of Avid, follows:
You joined Avid’s board in 2008. What attracted you to the company at the time?
A couple of things. One of them is I’m a technologist. I’ve been in technology and programming since I was a kid – my father taught computer science, actually. My educational background is in finance and economics.
What interested me about Avid is that technology should bring humans closer together, and bring more joy. In this case, someone has the idea of creating content for the enjoyment of another person, and Avid’s role lies somewhere in between there in trying to facilitate that.
I knew Gary when he came onboard, and I knew some of the board members. It was a challenging time – a different time than today. It was pre-Crisis, Avid was doing some different things. During that time, we’ve tried to capture the energy that Avid is known for, and get closer to our customers. We also had a product refresh cycle that we’ve been seeing the fruits of since it started 18 months ago.
Economic activity should be the measure of your value to the community. By that measure, we haven’t added enough value to the community, especially with what our really talented employees can do. I want to rebuild that community, based on how we define what they do: bringing joy to the people that they are trying to reach. That’s why I joined in 2008, and this is where we’re at now.
What were the factors that led to the change of leadership at Avid?
I think Gary felt like he had worked pretty hard to get the company through the crisis, continuing to spend on R&D, which is tough to do when there’s a lot of pressure.
He wanted to bring someone in with a history of growth in technology. I knew a lot of the board members, my company was going to be sold soon, and because we’re friends it was a lot more collaborative transition than would normally be the case. I also was familiar with the strategy, I knew why we did what we did, what worked and hadn’t, and my friendship with Gary made it smoother.
The impetus is to be more squarely focused on growth. The reality is that our market is changing pretty dramatically, so while focusing on the future and growth may sound like a romantic notion, we’re humbled enough to know that the way people create and consume content today is very different, and the value drivers are very different.
I think we’re in the best position to articulate the way you can connect humans with the idea of how they bring pleasure and joy to another person efficiently, economically, and to deliver the value it was intended to bring. Gary and the board wanted someone with that kind of experience tackling those issues in an industry in transition – someone who knows the technology, and with a history of staying connected with communities and inspiring others. That’s what we hope to do here.
Founded in 1987, Avid has had its share of ups and downs.
How would you characterize Gary Greenfield’s approach to running Avid? In what ways will you stay the course, and what do you expect to do differently?
Gary, as I said, came in at a very different time, so it’s hard to compare. I think he tried to re-establish credible relationships with the clients — that will continue. He tried to refresh the product suite – that will continue. He also established a clear message that we’re focused on the professionals and their market, and that will continue as well.
What will be different is we’ll spend more time focusing on changes in the market, and making sure that Avid reinforces its role as the thought leader. I think we’re in the best position: We created the product category, we’re coming off a big investment cycle in R&D, we have rabid fans, and people on the client and employee side are committed to winning together.
I’m focused on working with the energy of the community, because the challenges are bigger than ever. We want to create a vision of how we enable the most sought-after content, in a more powerful way, and sustain the great joy of creating wonderful music and movies, etc… We’re going to be much more focused on that, rather than realigning products, or achieving cost cuts.
It’s a different time for Avid. This is what I do, and this is why the board asked me to join.
How do you view the opportunities and challenges that characterize the audio portion of Avid’s market today, specifically?
Audio has a long history of lifting the spirits of humans since it’s been recorded. The reason I mention that is because the way it has been created and delivered has changed radically.
I think one of the challenges of audio is that its economic model is under tremendous pressure now, as the consumption of audio-based edited products is rising – it’s just rising in a radically different way than as short as 10 years ago. So your challenge is to work with the community on issues like DRM, and business models that still make money.

Sibelius Users would certainly disagree with the comments made above regarding the programme. The Avid take over has been a disaster.






Derek Williams



All platitudes. Neither Mr Hernandez nor his predecessor nor anyone else has ever been able to explain in simple, logical terms, the commercial wisdom in sacking the developers of Sibelius, the world’s best selling music scoring applicatiion, leading to their re-employment by the industry giant Yamaha to create a hot competitor for Sibelius.
With that rationale, the Avid board should sack themselves and also seek employment at Yamaha.

Dear Avid,
How come Pro Tools 11 is so buggy? Why does a company with millions, maybe billions of dollars neglect its user base so much? How does a company that makes the claim to be “the world’s leading provider of audio and video technology”, have such a difficult time in clearing up bugs that seem to remain and haunt and plague it’s software, version to version? Take a company like Apple Computer for instance, who acquired E-magic and their software, Logic years ago. Apple seemingly ignores development of Logic (no updates since 10.0.7 in over 6 months), and yet the platform is at least twice as stable as Pro Tools 11.3. How can this be? I wanted to take the time to write this letter because I am extremely frustrated. Your company has such stringent policies in regards to adhering to specific specifications to maintain compatibility, and yet when they are followed to the letter your software is still buggy. For example, I am running a late 2013 27″ iMac, model identifier: 14,2, which falls into your “qualified models” category. It is a Core i7 3.5 GHz with 32 GB of RAM running OS X 10.10.1 Yosemite and Pro Tools 11.3. I am not running any 3rd party plugins whatsoever, and yet I still have consistent bugs that inhibit me from being productive. So see, even when trying to eliminate all variables based on your companies own guidelines, myself and I believe many others still have major issues with the stability of Pro Tools. I certainly hope this letter does not fall on deaf ears, as I plan to share it with as many people and on as many social networks that I can. I will close by pasting in links to my last two threads on your forum. I sincerely hope things change soon. I will have to say that I don’t hold much hope for that though, seeing as I have been a Pro Tools user for well over 10 years now and things remain pretty much the same, unstable…
Sincerely,
A frustrated and disgusted Pro Tools user
