BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

sale 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% respectively, of the securities offered for sale by
the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as
anticipated.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. Mr. Furss has agreed to loan
us funds to implement our business plan and maintain our reporting status and
quotation on the OTCBB until we raise funds from this offering. Mr. Furss will
not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Furss and the loan being intend at 0% per
annum. Mr. Furss will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we
generate revenues to pay the obligation.

Total offering expenses are $9,500. This amount consists of $3,500 for legal
fees; $86.36 for printing costs; $1,300 for accounting fees and expenses; $3,000
for auditor fees and expenses; $1,600 for transfer agent fees; and $13.64 for
the registration filing fee.

"General and Administrative Costs" noted above include costs related to
accounting, audit, legal and transfer agent costs that we incur in filing
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as general working
capital, which are estimated to be approximately $10,000 per year. If we are
only able to complete 25% of the offering, we will have to rely upon loans from
our president to cover approximately $3,500 of our general and administrative
expenses.


The market for online tourism is highly competitive. Numerous online tourism
sites will compete with us. Our competitors are substantially larger and more
experienced than us and have longer operating histories, and have materially
greater financial and other resources than us.

The competition in the online we will face comes from online web sites:
www.responsibletravel.com, www.toursbylocals.com, tourguides.viator.com.


Company Description
We were incorporated on June 10, 2014 and intend to offer local guided tours via
our web platform. Our future web site will connect travelers with freelance
guides to facilitate the creation and purchase of private tours around the
world. Customers will simply enter their destination, choose a tour


 with
favorite guide and in just a few clicks, customers can book tour directly with
the local guide. Before booking customers can check the guide's profile, see
their feedbacks and even message the guide to customize a tour, tailored to
customer needs. We intend to offer guided tours in Europe and North America (USA
and Canada), and we plan to run our business from outside the United States
during the first year of operation.. Currently we have only testing version of
our website.

Whether customer is looking for a city tour, wine tasting experiences, walking
tours, bicycle tours or any other activity he/she wants to do together with a
local, our web site will help customer to connect with locals all over the
world.

Amber
Amber, the fossilized, hardened resin of a particular variety of pine tree, is one of the few gemstones of organic origin. Most amber is found in the Baltic, where it formed approximately 50 million years ago. Typically brown, yellow or orange in color, amber is amorphous rather than crystalline. Occasionally amber is found with interesting inclusions of insects or parts of plants.

											I'm new to this website and found it very easy to locate the items I needed. The pricing when I compared it to similar site was unbeatable.

The best part is I placed an order yesterday afternoon via standard shipping and it arrived at my door today.

They say and it's true that first impressions are everlasting. So let me say they made a BIG positive one on me.

Because our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer's suggested retail price, the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you place the item in your shopping cart. Retailers like Allegro Medical have the legal right to sell products at prices we set. However, adding the item to your cart allows us to show you our lower price consistent with our promise of always offering you the lowest possible prices on the widest selection of medical supplies, medical equipment and life enhancing products.
Adding this item to your shopping cart won't require you to buy it. However, our prices do change. If you decide to purchase this item now you are guaranteed the price now displayed in your shopping cart. Complete your purchase by clicking on the "checkout" button or simply remove the product from your cart if you decide not to make your purchase at this time.
