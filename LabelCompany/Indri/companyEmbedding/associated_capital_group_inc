(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Introduction  This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 to this report. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "we," "us," "our," "AC Group" or the "Company" refer collectively to Associated Capital Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries through which our operations are actually conducted.  The Spin-off  On November 30, 2015, GAMCO distributed all the outstanding shares of each class of common stock of AC Group on a pro rata one-for-one basis to the holders of each class of GAMCO's common stock. Prior to the distribution, GAMCO contributed the 93.9% interest it held in Gabelli & Company Investment Advisers, Inc. ("GCIA" f/k/a Gabelli Securities, Inc.) and certain cash and other assets to AC Group. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, AC purchased the 6.1% of GCIA shares owned by third parties and certain employees in exchange for 163,428 shares of the Company. GCIA is now a wholly owned subsidiary of AC.  In addition, the following transactions were also undertaken in connection with the spin-off:  GAMCO issued a promissory note (the "GAMCO Note") to AC Group in the original principal amount of $250.0 million used to partially capitalize the Company in connection with the spin-off. The GAMCO Note bears interest at 4.0% per annum and has a maturity date of November 30, 2020 with respect to the original principal amount of the GAMCO Note. Interest on the GAMCO Note will accrue from the most recent date for which interest has been paid, or if no interest has been paid, from the effective date of the GAMCO Note; provided, however, that at the election of GAMCO, payment of interest on the GAMCO Note may, in lieu of being paid in cash, be paid, in whole or in part, in kind on the then-outstanding principal amount (a "PIK Amount"). GAMCO will repay all PIK Amounts added to the outstanding principal amount of the GAMCO Note, in cash, on the fifth anniversary of the date on which each such PIK Amount was added to the outstanding principal amount of the GAMCO Note. In no event may any interest be paid in kind subsequent to November 30, 2019. GAMCO may prepay the GAMCO Note prior to maturity without penalty.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, AC received principal repayments totaling $150 million on the GAMCO Note. $50 million of the prepayment was applied against the principal amount due on November 30, 2016, $40 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2017, $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2018, and $30 million against the principal amount due on November 30, 2019. Of the $100 million principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2016, $10 million is due on November 30, 2017, $20 million is due on November 30, 2018, $20 million is due on November 30, 2019, and $50 million is due on November 30, 2020.  On November 27, 2015 GCIA purchased from GAMCO 4,393,055 shares of GAMCO class A common stock at a price of $34.1448 per share, based on the average of the volume weighted average price for GAMCO class A stock on an "ex-Distribution" basis from November 9, 2015 through and including November 27, 2015. GCIA paid for the purchase by issuing a note to GAMCO in the principal amount of $150.0 million (the "GCIA Note"). The GCIA Note was then contributed by GAMCO to AC and GCIA became a majority-owned subsidiary of AC on November 30, 2015 in connection with the completion of the spin-off. The GCIA Note is thus now an intercompany note within the AC Group.  Factors Affecting Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Except for the one month period subsequent to the spin-off, the Company's combined statements of income for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the Company's combined consolidated statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of GAMCO as the Company was not a standalone public company prior to the spin-off.  The combined consolidated statement of income for the period ended December 31, 2015 includes allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by GAMCO and not historically recorded at the business unit level. These expenses were allocated on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro-rata basis of headcount or other measures. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the combined consolidated financial statement may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and may not reflect its combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a separate, standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. References within these Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the combined consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 shall hereinafter be referred to as the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows or consolidated financial statements.  The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides alternative investment management services and institutional research services, as well as management of the Company's proprietary investment portfolio. In all these endeavors, the Company seeks investments trading at prices that differ from those determined using our proprietary "Private Market Value (PMV) with a CatalystTM" methodology where we have identified a near-term catalyst to narrow the market difference to PMV. Catalysts can include a spin-off, stock buyback, asset sale, management change, regulatory change or accounting change.  In its alternative asset management operations, subsidiaries of the Company serve as general partner or investment manager to investment funds including limited partnerships, offshore companies and separate accounts. The Company primarily manages assets in equity event-driven value strategies, across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios, earning management and incentive fees from its assets under management (AUM). The institutional research business offers domain knowledge-driven research and a sales and trading platform for institutional investors, earning fees from its institutional clients via trading commissions or direct payment. The Company manages its proprietary portfolio to maximize shareholder value and to support its other operating businesses.  Organizational Chart  During the second quarter of 2016, we negotiated to exchange AC shares for GCIA shares from the minority investors in GCIA. AC increased its interest in GCIA by 6.1% in return for 163,428 shares of AC and now owns 100% of GCIA. As of December 31, 2016, G.research was a wholly owned subsidiary of GCIA. However, on January 23, 2017 all of the outstanding membership interests of G.research were transferred to Institutional Services Holdings, LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of AC.  (as of December 31, 2016) (as of January 23, 2017)  [[Image Removed]]  Overview  Consolidated Statements of Income  Investment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our funds and accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. Growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service.  Incentive fees generally consist of an incentive allocation on the absolute gain in a portfolio or a fee of 20% of the economic profit, as defined in the agreements governing the investment vehicle. We recognize revenue only when the measurement period has been completed or at the time of an investor redemption.  Institutional research services revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis or direct payments on behalf of institutional clients. Commission revenues vary directly with the perceived value of the research, as well as account trading activity and new account generation.  Compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents 40% of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs.  Management fee is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli or his designee for acting as Executive Chairman pursuant to his Employment Agreement so long as he is an executive of AC.  Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs and clearing charges and fees incurred by the brokerage business.  Other income and expenses include net gains and losses from investments (which include both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities and equity in earnings of investments in partnerships), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments.  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders, as reported on a separate company basis, of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and net income attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Notes A and D in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition  We ended the 2016 year with approximately $908 million in cash and investments, net of securities sold, not yet purchased of $10 million. This includes $434 million of cash and short term US treasuries; $213 million of securities, net, including 4.4 million shares of GAMCO stock; and $261 million invested in affiliated and third party funds and partnerships. Our financial resources underpin our flexibility to pursue strategic objectives that may include acquisitions, lift-outs, seeding new investment strategies, and co-investing, as well as shareholder compensation in the form of share repurchase and dividends.  Total shareholders' equity was $874 million or $36.04 per share on December 31, 2016 compared to $752 million or $29.54 per share on December 31, 2015. Note that these shareholders' equity per share calculations are a non-GAAP measurement. The increase in equity from the end of 2015 was largely comprised of an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $108 million, an increase in investments in securities, net and affiliated and third party funds of $46 million, a reduction of $5 million in liabilities, partially offset by a reduction in receivables of $45 million.  The Company also reviews an analysis of Adjusted Economic book value ("AEBV"), and AEBV per share, a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful for analyzing AC's financial condition because it reflects the impact on book value if and when the GAMCO Note is paid down. The GAMCO Note that was issued as part of the spin-off transaction is not treated as an asset for GAAP purposes, but as a reduction in equity, and will continue to be reflected as a reduction in equity in future periods in the amount of the principal then outstanding. As the GAMCO Note pays down, the Company's total equity will increase, and once the GAMCO Note is fully paid off by GAMCO, the Company's total equity and AEBV will be the same. At December 31, 2016, AEBV for the Company was $974 million and the AEBV per share was $40.16 per share. The reconciliation of GAAP book value and GAAP book value per share to AEBV and AEBV per share at December 31, 2016 is shown below (in thousands, except for per share data):  Reconciliation of Total Equity to Adjusted Economic Book Value Total Per Share Total equity as reported $ 874,022 $ 36.04 Add: GAMCO Note 100,000 4.12 Adjusted Economic book value $ 974,022 $ 40.16  Our primary goal is to use our liquid resources to opportunistically and strategically grow book value and net income. While this goal is a priority, if opportunities are not present with what we consider a margin of safety, we will consider alternatives to return capital to our shareholders, including stock repurchases and dividends.  Assets Under Management Highlights We reported assets under management as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, CAGR (a) 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2016/2012 Event Merger Arb $ 1,076 $ 869 $ 796 $ 691 $ 721 10.5 % Event-Driven Value 133 145 167 140 124 1.8 Other 63 66 77 76 75 (4.3 ) Total AUM $ 1,272 (b) $ 1,080 $ 1,040 $ 907 $ 920 8.4 %  (a) Compound annual growth rate.  Our gross cash inflows by product line were as follows (in millions):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Event Merger Arb $ 297 $ 166 $ 162 $ 79 $ 248 Event-Driven Value 1 39 45 38 29 Other 1 2 5 6 23 Total Cash Inflows $ 299 $ 207 $ 212 $ 123 $ 300  Our gross cash outflows by product line were as follows (in millions):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Event Merger Arb $ (148 ) $ (119 ) $ (68 ) $ (137 ) $ (58 ) Event-Driven Value (18 ) (54 ) (21 ) (36 ) (42 ) Other (9 ) (12 ) (5 ) (13 ) (20 ) Total Cash Outflows $ (175 ) $ (185 ) $ (94 ) $ (186 ) $ (120 )  Our net appreciation and depreciation by product line were as follows (in millions):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Event Merger Arb $ 58 $ 26 $ 11 $ 28 $ 18 Event-Driven Value 5 (7 ) 3 14 5 Other 5 (1 ) 1 8 7 Total Net Appreciation/(Depreciation) $ 68 $ 18 $ 15 $ 50 $ 30  The majority of these assets have calendar year-end measurement periods; therefore, our incentive fees are primarily recognized in the fourth quarter when the uncertainty is removed at the end of the annual measurement period.  Operating Results for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 Revenues Total revenues were $16.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, $7.3 million higher than total revenues of $9.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to incentive fees of $9.3 million in the current quarter versus $4.2 million in the comparable quarter in 2015. Total revenues by revenue component were as follows (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2016 2015 $ % Investment advisory and incentive fees $ 11,734 $ 6,340 $ 5,394 85.1 % Institutional research services income 2,650 2,267 383 16.9 Other income 1,911 388 1,523 392.5 Total revenues $ 16,295 $ 8,995 $ 7,300 81.2 %  Investment advisory and incentive fees: Investment advisory income is directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM. We earn advisory fees based on the level of average AUM in our products.  Advisory fees were $2.4 million for the 2016 period compared to $2.1 million for the 2015 period, an increase of $0.3 million. This increase is correlated to the increase in AUM to $1.27 billion at December 31, 2016 versus $1.08 billion at December 31, 2015.  Incentive fees are directly related to the gains generated for our clients. We earn a percentage, usually 20%, of the economic gains of our clients' AUM. These fees are generally recorded at the end of the measurement period, which is year-end. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $9.3 million in incentive fees versus $4.2 million for the comparable quarter in 2015 due to improved performance in our merger arbitrage funds.  Institutional research services: Institutional research services revenues in the 2016 period were $2.7 million, an increase from $2.3 million in the 2015 period, resulting from higher brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis and sales manager fees earned from at-the market offerings of certain GAMCO closed-end funds.  Other income: Other income was $1.9 million for fourth quarter 2016 versus $0.4 million for 2015, an increase of $1.5 million due to a renegotiation of the research services fee agreements with affiliates.  Expenses  Compensation: Compensation costs, which include variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, were $12.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase from $9.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Fixed compensation costs, which include salaries, bonuses and benefits, increased to $5.3 million in the 2016 period from $5.2 million in the 2015 period primarily due to an increase in research analyst headcount and additional administrative personnel necessary to support our reporting as a stand-alone public company. The remainder of the compensation expense represents variable compensation that fluctuates with management fee and incentive fee revenues. For fourth quarter of 2016, variable payouts on revenues were $7.5 million, an increase of $3.2 million from the $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Variable payouts as a percent of revenues are impacted by the mix of products upon which management and performance fees are earned and the extent to which they may exceed their allocated costs.  Stock based compensation: Stock based compensation expense decreased to $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock that occurred in October of 2015.  Management fees: Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits, which is paid to Mario J. Gabelli or his designees pursuant to his employment agreements with GAMCO and AC. In the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, AC recorded management fee expense of $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Note that the management fee expense for the first two months of the fourth quarter 2015 was determined pursuant to Mr.Gabelli's employment agreement with GAMCO and the management fee expense for the month of December, post spin-off, was determined based on Mr. Gabelli's employment agreement with AC. Going forward, management fee expense will be determined based on Mr. Gabelli's employment agreement with AC.  Other operating expenses: Our other operating expenses were $2.4 million in the 2016 period up from $1.8 million in the 2015 period due to increased expenses correlated to our transformation to a stand-alone public company.  Investment and other non-operating income, net  Net gain from investments: Net gain from investments is directly related to the performance of our proprietary capital accounts. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, net gains from investments declined to $7.1 million from the prior year's $9.1 million.  Interest and dividend income: Interest and dividend income increased to $2.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016 from $2.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015.  Interest expense: Interest expense was $0.04 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $0.4 million on the comparable quarter in 2015.  Income Taxes  The effective tax rate ("ETR") was 23.3% and 27.4% for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rates fluctuate below the standard corporate tax rate of 34% primarily due to the benefits of the dividends received deduction in each period and donated appreciated securities in the 2016 period. The rate fluctuation is indicative of the significant amount of investments that the Company holds relative to its income from operations.  Net Income  Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $3.6 million versus $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by the $5.4 million cost of AC's initial Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution Program partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in incentive fees.  Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Revenues Total revenues were $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $8.4 million higher than total revenues of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total revenues by revenue component were as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2016 2015 $ % Investment advisory and incentive fees $ 18,320 $ 12,635 $ 5,685 45.0 % Institutional research services income 9,604 8,397 1,207 14.4 Other income 3,303 1,811 1,492 82.4 Total revenues $ 31,227 $ 22,843 $ 8,384 36.7 %  Investment advisory and incentive fees: Investment advisory income is directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM. We earn advisory fees based on the level of average AUM in our products.  Advisory fees were $8.9 million for 2016 compared to $8.4 million for 2015, an increase of $0.5 million. This increase is a result of the increase in average AUM to $1.19 billion in 2016 from $1.07 billion in 2015, an increase of $12 million.  Incentive fees are directly related to the gains generated for our clients. We earn a percentage, usually 20%, of the economic gains of our clients' AUM. Incentive fees were $9.4 million in 2016, up $5.1 million from $4.3 million in 2015 as market appreciation in our clients' accounts were higher in 2016 as compared to 2015.  Institutional research services: Institutional research services revenues in 2016 were $9.6 million, a $1.2 million, or 14%, increase from $8.4 million in 2015 resulting from higher brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis and sales manager fees earned from at-the market offerings of certain GAMCO closed-end funds.  Other income: Other income was $3.3 million for 2016 versus $1.8 million for 2015, an increase of $1.5 million due to a renegotiation of the research services fee agreements with affiliates.  Expenses  Compensation: Compensation costs, which include variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, were $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a 17% increase from $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Fixed compensation costs, which include salaries, bonuses and benefits, increased 12% to $19.3 million in 2016 from $17.3 million in 2015 due primarily to an increase in research analyst headcount and additional administrative personnel necessary to support our reporting as a stand-alone public company. The remainder of the compensation expenses represents variable compensation that fluctuates with management fee and incentive fee revenues. For 2016, variable payouts on revenues were $11.7 million, up $2.7 million from the $9.0 million in 2015. Variable payouts are impacted by the mix of products upon which performance fees are earned and the extent to which they may exceed their allocated costs.  Stock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $2.5 million in 2016, a decrease of $2.4 million, as compared to $4.9 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock that occurred in October of 2015.  Management fees: Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mario J. Gabelli or his designees pursuant to his employment agreements with AC and GAMCO. In 2016 and 2015, AC recorded a management fee expense of $1.6 million and contra-expense of $0.3 million, respectively, as presented in the consolidated statements of income. Note that the management fee expense for the first eleven months of 2015 was determined on a carve-out basis pursuant to Mr. Gabelli's employment agreement with GAMCO and the management fee expense for the month of December 2015 and full year 2016, post spin-off, was determined based on Mr. Gabelli's employment agreement with AC. The management fee expense for the month of December 2015 was $0.2 million. Subsequent to the spin-off, management fee expense is determined based on Mr. Gabelli's employment agreement with AC.  . . .  Mar 14, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
