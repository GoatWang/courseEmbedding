What is Anesthesiology?

Anesthesiology is a branch of medicine which deals with the reduction of pain for patients that are going through surgery. Millions of surgical procedures are performed each year, and most cannot be done without anesthetics due to the extreme pain the patients would experience. Anesthesiologists are responsible for administering anesthetics to patients and then monitoring how they respond to them before, during and after surgery has been completed.
Once the patient's surgery has been completed they must recover from the anesthetics effects. During this time they must be carefully monitored to ensure they completely regain consciousness and the anesthesiologist will decide if and when the patient has recovered to the extent that they can be released from the hospital. The most important responsibility of anesthesiology is pain reduction, either partially or completely. Many surgical procedures require extreme precision and if a patient jerks during the operation due to pain the consequences can be severe.

Common Tasks Performed by Anesthesiologists

- Provide pain reducing medications
- Perform airway management
- Advanced life support
- Preparing patients for surgery
- Pulmonary or cardiac resuscitation
- Provides medical assessments

				An anesthesiologist is trained to provide pain relief and maintenance, or restoration, of a stable condition during and immediately following an operation or an obstetric or diagnostic procedure. The anesthesiologist assesses the risk of the patient undergoing surgery and optimizes the patient's condition prior to, during and after surgery. In addition to these management responsibilities, the anesthesiologist provides medical management and consultation in pain management and critical care medicine. Anesthesiologists diagnose and treat acute, long-standing and cancer pain problems; diagnose and treat patients with critical illnesses or severe injuries; direct resuscitation in the care of patients with cardiac or respiratory emergencies, including the need for artificial ventilation; and supervise post-anesthesia recovery.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

I love this seminar. Everything was organized. It was great having Wednesday as a free day and that would be crucial for me to continue coming to the NWAS seminar! Thank you! Presenters were all great and certainly had different teaching styles but I found Dr. Joshi to be absolutely top notch--loved his studies--this style was more in line with what I expected! I learned a lot. He had very current updates.
