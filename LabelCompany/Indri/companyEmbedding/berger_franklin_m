SAN DIEGO, Dec. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Tocagen Inc., a clinical-stage selective cancer immunotherapy company, today announced that Franklin M. Berger, CFA, has been appointed to the board of directors. Mr. Berger will also serve as the chairman of a newly formed audit committee responsible for overseeing Tocagen's accounting, financial reporting, disclosure and financial risk management activities.
Mr. Berger is a biotechnology industry analyst with over 25 years of experience in capital markets and financial analysis. He previously served as managing director, equity research, and senior biotechnology analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities from 1998 to 2003. During this time he was involved in the issuance of over $12 billion in biotechnology company equity or equity-linked securities. These activities included Genentech's IPO, the largest biotechnology financing ever executed, and the first large financings for Celgene Corporation and Gilead Sciences. Previously, Mr. Berger served in a similar capacity at Salomon Smith Barney. 
"Franklin is one of the most respected and accomplished Wall Street investment professionals and advisors in the biotechnology industry today," said Harry Gruber, M.D., chief executive officer of Tocagen. "We are pleased that Franklin has joined the board and Tocagen will benefit greatly from his expertise in finance, business and technology as we advance into the next phase of development for Toca 511 & Toca FC."
Added Mr. Berger, "Tocagen's potentially transformative gene delivery technology platform and highly differentiated product candidates stand out among cancer immunotherapeutics. The company's initial indication, glioblastoma, arguably has the greatest unmet medical need in cancer today, and I look forward to playing a role in the company's continued work to make a difference in the lives of brain cancer patients."
Presently, Mr. Berger serves on the board of directors of Immune Design and Five Prime Therapeutics. He has served on the board of directors for numerous companies, including Seattle Genetics, Inc. Mr. Berger is a founder and managing director of FMB Research and previously co-founded the small-cap focused NEMO fund at Sectoral Asset Management. 
Mr. Berger is a CFA charterholder, holds a master's degree in business from Harvard Business School, and received a master's degree in international economics and a bachelor's degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins University. He is a founding fellow of the Biotechnology Study Center at NYU School of Medicine.
About Toca 511 & Toca FCToca 511 & Toca FC, the company's lead investigational combination product, is being evaluated in three clinical trials in patients with recurrent high grade glioma, including glioblastoma. Toca 511 & Toca FC, an extended-release formulation of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), is designed to have a dual mechanism of action. Toca 511 delivers a prodrug-activating gene selectively to cancer cells. Then the prodrug-activating enzyme produced in the cancer cell activates orally administered Toca FC given in cycles, into a powerful antimetabolite, 5-FU, selectively in the cancer. In animal models, the production of 5-FU locally kills dividing tumor cells during each 5-FC cycle, which leads to durable and selective anticancer immune responses. Data from ongoing clinical trials show encouraging evidence for increased survival compared to historical controls, safety and tolerability, antitumor activity and evidence to support the proposed mechanism of action. Based on these data the company is now planning to commence late-stage clinical trials in patients with high grade glioma.
About Tocagen Inc.Tocagen is a clinical-stage selective cancer immunotherapy company pursuing discovery, development and commercialization of gene therapy drugs using a novel retroviral replicating vector platform, which selectively infects cancer cells. These therapies are designed to help patients fight their cancer by locally activating their immune system selectively against their cancer, with subsequent systemic benefit.  
Tocagen has received grant support from leading brain cancer foundations, including Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure (ABC2), National Brain Tumor Society (NBTS), American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA), Musella Foundation and Voices Against Brain Cancer (VABC).

SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Cali., March 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Immune Design, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on the development of novel immune-based therapies for cancer and other chronic conditions, today announced the appointment of Franklin M. Berger, CFA to the company's board of directors.
Mr. Berger is a major player in the biotechnology industry with more than 25 years of experience in capital markets and financial analysis. He has served as a consultant in the biotechnology industry since 2003, advising major biopharmaceutical firms, mid-capitalization biotechnology companies, specialist asset managers and venture capital companies in a range of areas including business development, strategic advisory/financings, partnering and royalty acquisition. Prior to that, Mr. Berger spent 12 years in sell-side equity research, most recently as Managing Director, U.S. Equity Research and Senior Biotechnology Analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, Inc. 
"Franklin brings a wealth of experience to Immune Design," said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Immune Design.  "He is a great addition to our experienced board and will provide vital strategic financial insights and advice to help guide the continued growth of our exciting company."
During his five years at J. P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Mr. Berger was involved with the issuance of over $12 billion in biotechnology company equity or equity-linked securities.  He was associated with several notable financings in the biotechnology sector, including the Genentech IPO and the initial large Celgene Corporation financings. Mr. Berger began his career as a sell-side analyst at Josephthal & Co. in 1991, subsequently moving to Salomon Smith Barney in 1997 serving as Director, Equity Research and Senior Biotechnology Analyst.  Institutional Investor Magazine ranked him on J. P. Morgan's All-Star Research Team. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) selected Mr. Berger as the No. 1 ranked biotechnology analyst in its All-Star Analyst Survey in 1997 and No. 2 ranked in the WSJ's 2000 Survey. In 2000, he became a Founding Fellow of the Biotechnology Study Center at New York University School of Medicine. Mr. Berger currently serves on the board of four public biotechnology companies: Seattle Genetics, Inc., Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., Bellus Health, Inc. and BioTime, Inc. He also serves or has served on private biotech company boards including Caprion Proteomics (sold in July 2012), Inc. and ViroChem Pharma, Inc., which was purchased by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $400 million in 2009. 
Mr. Berger holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and an M.A. in International Economics and a B.A. in International Relations from Johns Hopkins University.
"The field of cancer immunotherapy is attracting notable interest and investment, and Immune Design is very well-positioned to take a leadership role in this evolving landscape through application of its novel discovery platforms that have generated multiple product candidates now in clinical trials," said Mr. Berger. "I look forward to working with the Immune Design team."  
About Immune Design

Morgan Securities, most recently as Managing Director, Equity Research and Senior Biotechnology Analyst. Previously, Mr. Berger served in similar capacities at Salomon Smith Barney and Josephthal & Co. Mr. Berger also serves on the boards of directors of BELLUS Health, Inc. (OTCPK: BLUSF), ESSA Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: EPIX), Immune Design Corp. (NASDAQ: IMDZ) and Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: FPRX), each of which is a public biotechnology company. Mr. Berger formerly served on the boards of Seattle Genetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SGEN), Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AUPH) and Emisphere Technologies, Inc., BioTime, Inc. and VaxGen, Inc., each of which were public biopharmaceutical companies during Mr. Berger's service as a director.
