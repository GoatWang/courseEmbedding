Retirement ServicesIf you ask 10 people what their idea of a perfect retirement is, you’ll likely get 10 different answers.  Some will no doubt involve world travel, others might long for the call of a tropical location and some will want the simple joy of a life of leisure.
There’s one constant, the financial foundation to support your ideal retirement plan.  That’s why we spend the time getting to know you and your family.
Choosing the right retirement plan depends upon a number of factors including suitability, eligibility, and the plan’s ability to meet your financial needs.  Once we have a good understanding of your future needs, we work together to develop a plan that will move you towards that “Perfect Retirement”.








IRA RolloversTraditional IRARoth IRASimple IRASep IRAProfit Sharing Plan401K PlanPension PlanIRA Rollovers
A retirement fund “rollover” occurs when you withdraw assets from one eligible retirement plan and within 60 days you contribute part or all of it to another eligible plan.  The transaction is not taxable, but needs to be reported on your federal tax return.  Most distributions from eligible retirement plans can be rolled over, except for:
The nontaxable part of a distribution, such as your after-tax contributions to a retirement plan.
A distribution that is one of a series of payments based on your life expectancy, or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary, or paid over a period of ten years or more,
A required minimum distribution,
A hardship distribution,
Dividends on employer securities, or
The cost of life insurance coverage.
Other exclusions exist for certain loans and corrective distributions.
If a distribution is paid to you, you have 60 days from the date you receive it to roll it over to another eligible retirement plan.  Any taxable amount of a distribution that is not rolled over must be included in income in the year of the distribution, and if you are under 59 ½ at the time of distribution that portion might be subject to a 10% tax for early distribution.
Traditional IRA
A traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a personal savings plan that provides tax advantages to individuals saving for retirement.  A Traditional IRA allows our investment managers to direct pretax income towards select stocks, bonds and other financial assets that can grow tax deferred.
A Traditional IRA is a great way to lower your tax liability and save money for retirement.  If you invest $5000 into a Traditional IRA, you can claim that $5000 as a tax deduction on your income taxes.  The deduction will lower your adjusted gross income, which in-turn will lower your tax liability.
When it’s time to start receiving distributions from your Traditional IRA, the income is treated as ordinary income and may be subject to income tax.  Distributions are required to start coming out of the account when you reach 70 ½ years of age.
There are additional benefits and restrictions of the Traditional IRA, please give us a call to discuss and see if a Traditional IRA would be a good choice for your retirement plan.
Roth IRA
A Roth IRA differs in many ways from a Traditional IRA, but the primary differentiator is the Roth IRA does not provide the tax deduction that a Traditional IRA does.  You are taxed up front, but your contributions and gains grow tax-free.  This makes the Roth IRA a great vehicle to create tax-free income and growth for your retirement portfolio.
A Roth IRA may be invested in any combination of Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, Certificates of deposit and Money Market funds.  Earnings are not subject to income tax, provided you have held the account for 5 years or more and are at least age 59½.  Your direct contributions can be withdrawn at any time and are tax free.
Contribution limits can change year to year, as can adjusted gross income limits to contribute.  We would be happy to spend some time reviewing your account and determining if a Roth IRA would be a good vehicle for your retirement portfolio.
There are some important benefits and restrictions of the Roth IRA.
Benefits are
Tax free growth.
Assets can be passed to beneficiaries after death.
Easy withdrawal process.
No Minimum withdrawal requirements.
You can have a Roth IRA even if you have other retirement plans.
Restrictions are:
Contributions are not Tax deductible like they are with a Traditional IRA.
Fees will be assessed (10% ) if you withdraw money before 59½, unless for a variety of qualified reasons (Education, First time home purchase, Medical expenses, disability health insurance Etc)
Income limits on participationSimple IRA
The SIMPLE IRA Plan allows employees and employers to contribute to a Traditional IRA set up for employees.  SIMPLE stand for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees and it is ideally suited as a retirement savings plan for small companies that do not offer a retirement plan.
An eligible employer may adopt a SIMPLE IRA and must meet the requirements that apply to traditional IRAs.  However, contributions to an employee’s SIMPLE IRA are limited to:
Employee contributions made under a salary reduction agreement; and
Employer contributions that are made as either matching contributions or non-elective contributions.
The IRS has issued two model forms that may be used by employers that want to establish a SIMPLE IRA for their employees.  If the employer has established a SIMPLE plan, an employee must be eligible to participate in any calendar year if he or she received at least $5,000 of compensation from the employer during each of the two preceding calendar years, and is reasonably expected to receive at least $5,000 in compensation during the current calendar year.
A self-employed individual is treated as an employee and may participate in a SIMPLE plan if the minimum compensation requirement is met.
Sep IRA
A Simplified Employee Pension IRA (SEP) provides an employer with a simplified way of making contributions to an employee’s retirement account.  Contributions are tax deductible to the employer, are not currently taxable to the employee and any earnings accumulate income tax-deferred.
No annual contribution is required by the employer, but if a contribution is made it must be the same percentage of compensation for all eligible employees.  The annual employer contribution limit for 2013 is the lesser of 25% of compensation or $51,000.
Any employee who is at least 21 years old and has worked for the company in at least three of the last five calendar years must be permitted to participate.
Advantages to the employer:
Contributions are tax-deductible
Contributions and costs are flexible
Reporting is minimal – no IRS or Department of Labor forms
Little or no administrative expense
Advantages to the employee:
Participant has the right to direct investments
Annual contributions are not currently taxed to the participant
Earnings on the account are not currently taxed to the participant
Disadvantages to the employer:
Contributions must be made for part-time and seasonal employees
Employees are always 100% vested
Disadvantages to the employee:
No guarantee as to future benefits
Investment risks rest on the participant
No assurance as to the frequency and amount of employer contributionsProfit Sharing Plan
A profit sharing plan is an arrangement that allows employees to share in the profits of their company.  Profit sharing plans are a great way to give employees a sense of ownership in a firm, which in turn gives them incentive to increase job performance and decrease excess spending.
Each employee receives a percentage of profits based on the company’s earnings.  The firm dictates what portion of the profit will be shared and payments may vary in accordance with salary or wages, and are in addition to regular earnings.
Typically, there are restrictions with regard to withdrawing funds, especially without penalties.
Charter Trust can help in the creation and administration of your profit sharing plan, and can invest the assets in accordance with your investment policy statement.  Should you not yet have an investment policy statement, we can assist in developing, drafting and implementing one for you.
401K Plan
A 401(k) plan is a retirement plan that meets certain participation requirements of IRS Section 401(k).  To make contributions an employee can agree to a salary reduction or to defer a bonus, and the employer can also make discretionary contributions.  Employer contributions, if any, are tax-deductible to the employer, are not currently taxable to the employee, and any earnings accumulate income tax-deferred.
The maximum annual participant contribution limit for 2015 is $18,000; for those ages 50 and older an additional “catch-up” contribution of $6,000 can be made.  Employers may deduct contributions of up to 25% of covered payroll (maximum eligible per participant is $245,000).
Plan investments must be diversified and prudent.  Generally, participants direct the investment of their own deferrals and may also direct the investment of the employer contributions.  Participant contributions must be always 100% vested.  Employer contributions are usually subject to a vesting schedule, so should the participant leave the company before they are 100% vested, a percentage of that portion of the account is forfeited.  Any employee who is at least 21 years old and with 1000 hours of service within one year, subject to some exclusions, must be permitted to participate.
Among the advantages to the employer:
 Employers are not required to make discretionary contributions
Contributions are tax deductible
Employer can direct employer investments
Employer matching contribution is a popular employee benefit
Advantages to the employee:
 Participant generally has the right to direct their investments
Participant deferrals are made with pre-tax dollars
Earnings on the account are not currently taxed
Employer may make matching contributions of some amount
Disadvantages to the employer:
Employers may be required to make mandated contributions to satisfy certain requirements
Administrative costs are greater than with other types of plans
Among the disadvantages to the employee:
 No guarantee as to future benefits
Investment risks rest on the participant
Company may or may not make discretionary contributionsPension Plan
A Defined Benefit Pension Plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan, but it is entirely different from many pension funds where payouts are dependent on the return of the invested funds.
With a defined benefit plan, employee benefits are determined by personal factors such as years of service or salary.  It promises a specific monthly benefit at retirement, sometimes an exact dollar amount, but more often a percentage determined by the assessment of each employee’s personalized factors.  There are restrictions to when and how you can withdraw these funds without penalty.
At Charter Trust, we will assist in working with a third party administrator and actuary to manage your plan, and we will invest the assets in the plan in accordance with the plan document and current laws.

Welcome to The Golden Charter Trust

Golden Charter funeral plans are sold by Golden Charter Limited, and if you are looking to purchase a funeral plan, or have a query on an existing plan, please contact Golden Charter Limited directly.
The Golden Charter Trust (“the Trust”) is an entirely separate legal entity from Golden Charter Limited, with its own Board of independent Trustees.  To give further assurance, the Trust complies with the Rules and Code of Conduct of the Funeral Planning Authority, which requires that all monies from the sale of funeral plans by Golden Charter are placed in the Trust.

TRUST & INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
WITH A GLOBAL REPUTATION 



Creating and Managing our Clients' Wealth Since 1984 























			Home		


Rich Woodfin 


			2016-11-29T13:53:01+00:00		









Since 1984 we’ve been helping our clients create and manage their wealth.  We’ve created a cohesive team of investment, tax, and planning experts who are available to clients when and where they want them.  We are singularly focused on achieving your financial goals and work every day to earn your trust.  Our clients have diverse requirements – from those who are just starting to save to those who are investing savings from a lifetime of work.
Please explore our website and contact us with any questions you may have.








INVESTMENT MANAGEMENTEvery investor is unique.  Whether looking for income, capital appreciation, security, protection from taxes or saving for specific needs like college or retirement, investors have different goals and approaches as to how their money should be managed.  Learn More




TRUST SERVICESTrusts aren’t just for the wealthy.  Trusts are legal mechanisms that let you put conditions on how and when your assets will be distributed upon your death. They also allow you to reduce your estate and gift taxes and to distribute assets to your heirs without the cost, delay and publicity of probate court.  Learn More




ESTATE PLANNINGGetting started with Estate Planning is one of those things most people would rather avoid.  While talking about one’s mortality is not usual dinner time discussion, it is an important conversation to have.  Take the first step and start the conversation with your family and loved ones.  Learn More




FINANCIAL PLANNINGFinancial planning helps clients get the most out of their assets and it’s never too early (or late) to start planning.  If you do not have a solid financial plan, the right time to start one is now.  Learn More




RETIREMENT ACCOUNTSIf you ask 10 people what their idea of a perfect retirement is, you’ll likely get 10 different answers.  The prevailing constant is the financial foundation required to support your ideal retirement plan.  That’s why we spend the time getting to know you and your family.  Learn More




FAMILY OFFICEOur Family Office service allows clients to live the life of their dreams and not be burdened with the complexity of managing great wealth.  We act as the family’s chief financial officer and provide the resources and expertise to address all aspects of their financial life.  Learn More
