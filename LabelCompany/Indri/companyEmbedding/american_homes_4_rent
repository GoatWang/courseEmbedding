Worst company I have ever dealt with they lied telling me they would work with me because my credit was a little worse than the "requirement".So after we get charged 70 for two applications they deny me because of mine and my fiancées credit.
Related: American Homes 4 Rent - NOTICE
Then they tell us they can still get us into the house if we pay a year rent up front. The first house we looked at from them smelled like gas had mold and moss all over the outside of it the backyard looked horrible. Do not rent from them.
Don't even apply.They are crooks and liars.

AGOURA HILLS, Calif., July 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:    AMH) (the "Company"), a leading provider of high quality single-family homes for rent, today announced that on June 30, 2017, the Company and its operating partnership, American Homes 4 Rent, L.P. (the "Borrower") amended their $1 billion credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and lender, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., Compass Bank, PNC Bank, National Association, U.S. Bank National Association, City National Bank, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Bank N.A., Associated Bank, National Association, and Citibank, N.A., as lenders. 








"We are pleased to announce these changes to our credit facilities, which recognize our investment grade credit ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's and substantially lower our cost of borrowing under our bank facilities," stated David Singelyn, American Homes 4 Rent's Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, the unsecured credit facilities provide us with a more flexible corporate borrowing structure. We appreciate the ongoing strong support from our bank group and believe the changes to our credit facilities reflect their continued confidence in our future."
The amended credit agreement provides for an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $200 million term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has an initial maturity date of June 30, 2021 and may be extended for two six month extentions at the Borrower's option if certain conditions are met. The term loan facility matures on June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2017, $92 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $200 million was outstanding under the term loan facility. 
The interest rate on the amended revolving facility is at either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.825% to 1.55% or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.55%.  Loans under the term loan facility accrue interest at either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.90% to 1.75% or a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75%.  In each case, the actual margin is determined based on the Company's credit ratings in effect from time to time. 
About American Homes 4 Rent

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.

1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

AGOURA HILLS, Calif., July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:    AMH) (the "Company") today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of its Series G Preferred Shares.  The Company also plans to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the Series G Preferred Shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The Company intends to apply to list the Series G Preferred Shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AMHPRG."








The Company will contribute the net proceeds from the offering to its operating partnership in exchange for Series G operating partnership units.  The operating partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the contribution to repay indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facility and term loan facility, to acquire single-family properties and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Company's securities.
Wells Fargo Securities, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Raymond James are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering, and Jefferies is acting as lead manager for the offering.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful before registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.  
The offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement.  Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the offering and the final prospectus supplement, when available, may be obtained by visiting EDGAR on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or from Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Attention: Equity Syndicate Department, 375 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10152, or via telephone (800) 326-5897, or via email cmclientsupport@wellsfargo.com; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Attention: Prospectus Department, NC1-004-03-43, 200 North College Street, 3rd Floor, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255-0001, or via telephone (800) 294-1322, or via email dg.prospectus_requests@baml.com; and Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Attention: Equity Syndicate, 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, Florida 33716, or via telephone (800) 248-8863, or via email mailto:prospectus@raymondjames.com.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements relate to beliefs, expectations or intentions and similar statements concerning matters that are not of historical fact and are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "potential," "plan," "goal" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, the Company's ability to complete the offering and the intended use of net proceeds. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. While the Company's management considers these expectations to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. These and other important factors, including "Risk Factors" disclosed in, or incorporated by reference into, the prospectus from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC, may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from anticipated results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Finding A Qualified Tenant Fast
As you very well know, every day your apartment or house for rent sits vacant, you’re losing money. Getting as many potential renters’ eyes on your rental advertising is key to getting a qualified tenant as soon as you can. Long gone are the days where people relied solely on newspapers for apartment advertising. More and more, renters are turning to the internet to scour free websites for list of rental homes and apartments. When listing rentals with www.RentDigs.com, not only is it free for you to advertise but it’s also free for the prospective renters. Unlike many other rental advertising websites, we don’t require the renter to register before being able to see all the details of your rental listing. When websites require the renter to register, many times the refuse and leave frustrated and never see your rental or apartment advertising that you listed – wasting both your time and their time.


Making Your Free Rental Advertisement Work Fr You!
So you’ve decided listing your rental home or apartment online for free (can’t argue with the price!) is the best advertising method for you – what’s next? As stated above getting as many potential renters’ eyes on your rental advertising is key. With RentDigs.com we go above and beyond to help with this by also posting your advertisement on additional rental advertising websites (Oodle.com, Trovit.com and RentJungle.com) – for free! In addition, we work very hard to make sure our site, as well as your rental listing, is index frequently by all the major search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo). By doing all this we ensure we bring a large number of potential renters to view the houses for rent and apartments advertised on our site.


Getting Started Advertising Your Apartment or Rental Home Online (For Free!!)
Okay, so you’re ready to get started and find a tenant for your vacant rental home or apartment fast!! The first step is to get registered! It’s quick and easy – all you need to do is enter your email address and create a password for your account. Don’t worry, we don’t SPAM (we hate SPAM too)!!!! The only time you’ll get an email from us is right after you register (a welcome email), one more after you list a property (to confirm it’s active) and when a prospective tenant chooses to contact you via the contact form. If we notice you have not logged in 30 days, we'll send you a reminder email to make sure your listing is still available and your ad is upto date. We use a contact form which hides your email address to prevent others from seeing it and using it for malicious purposes. Only when you choose to reply to the prospective tenant, do they see your email.


Tips To Get The Most From Your Online Rental Advertising
Below are some tips to keep in mind when creating your free rental listing. These will not only help you find more qualified tenants but also draw more eyes to your ad!


1


Be as descriptive as possible in your advertisement!!! People want to know as much as they can about the rental property they will soon be calling home. The more you type, the better!!!





2


Upload pictures of your apartment or rental property! We allow you to upload up to 8 pictures. You know the old saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” and this holds true with rental advertising as well. If you don’t have pictures now, you can always update your rental listing with them later. Rental listings with multiple pictures get viewed more so you up your chances of finding that perfect renter.





3


Review your listing once it’s active! Make sure your phone number and address are listed correctly. Avoid using abbreviations – this is especially true for the city name. Most renters will search the rental listings by the full city name. It should go without saying, but spelling the city name that the rental is being advertised in is key too.





4


Avoid using all caps when typing. This only makes your rental advertisement hard to read and looks unprofessional.





5


Once your rental listing is active post a link to it on your Facebook wall (assuming you have a Facebook account). This will instantly bring attention to your advertisement and let your friends and family know your rental is now available.

Questions?
Click below for more information.


What does rent to own mean? 

Structured correctly, rent to own houses enable buyers to invest in their homes by turning lease payments into equity ownership.



Is rent to own a new concept? 

The concept is not new, but it has increased in popularity recently. Buyers and sellers have been structuring rent to own transactions for decades. However, recent changes to lending standards have made it challenging for many aspiring homeowners to secure a traditional loan, and rent to own has become a popular alternative.



What type of potential buyers choose the rent to own method? 

Potential buyers have historically included the following: (a) Renters who want to improve their financial profile (i.e. save more money and restore any credit problems) over the course of a lease in order to obtain an affordable mortgage at the end of the lease (b) Renters who are presently unable to qualify for suitable mortgage rates due to credit issues (c) Families who want to try out a home, neighborhood, or school district before committing to it long-term (d) Renters who are tired of renting and want to take positive steps towards home ownership (e) Real estate investors.



What do I get when I sign up? 

You get access to the RentBeforeOwning.com Membership website, which is only available if you become a member. Using this members-only website, you can search our exclusive database of rent to own and owner financed listings, as well as for sale by owner and rental listings that MAY be available on a rent to own basis. You also get a rent to own tutorial and wizard that helps you in your rent to own search. In summary, you get the nation's best and most complete resource for rent to own real estate. 



Do you have rent to own homes in my area? 

We offer the most complete rent to own and owner finance database in the industry. But remember that these homes are 'hidden treasures' that are not available everywhere, so you need to search many areas to find that special home. We also update our database very frequently so while you may not find a home in your area today, there's a chance that one may become available shortly after that.



How much does it cost? 

We charge a $1.00 fee to activate your account, which will provide unlimited access for 14 days. You may decide to continue access after the 14 days, in which case the monthly fee of $49.80 will be automatically charged to your credit card each month . If you don't want to be charged that amount, simply cancel at anytime and no further charges will ever apply.



Will I have to pay a monthly fee? 

No, you will not be required to. The monthly fee will apply ONLY if you decide to continue past the trial period by not cancelling during the trial period. If you cancel prior to the trial period ending, the only fee you pay is $1.00.



How easy is it cancel? 

Cancelling is easy and hassle-free. Simply login, or you can click cancel here. Enter your user information and you can cancel immediately (no questions asked). We will follow up with a confirmation email. NOTE: If you have problems doing this, please call us toll free at (888)�250-5563.



Will I find a rent to own home? 

We cannot promise that, since a lot depends on what you do and the availability of listings in your specific area. But we can promise that we give you the best chance of finding a new dream home that you can rent to own, by providing the most comprehensive list of rent to own homes nationwide, as well as tools and information to help you get your new home. In fact, we have many clients who are new home owners, by finding a home they can rent to own, some within the first week of signing up!



What is the difference between rent to own, lease option, lease purchase, rent to buy, owner financing, and land contract? 

Lease option transactions are also known as rent to own, or rent to buy transactions. In a lease option, the landlord-seller leases the home to the tenant-buyer and the tenant-buyer has the option to purchase the home for a pre-determined price at any point prior to the end of the lease. The main components of a lease option transaction are the lease term, the purchase price, the down payment, and the rent credit. 
Lease purchase transactions are similar to lease options; however, rather than granting the tenant-buyer the option to purchase the home, lease purchases contractually obligate the tenant-buyer to purchase the home.
Owner financing agreements and land contracts have similar payment schedules to that of lease options and lease purchases; however, these agreements enable the buyer to purchase the home and obtain title at the beginning of the transaction. The seller, instead of receiving a large cash payment at the time of 
purchase, as he/she would in a conventional sale, serves as a lender for the remainder of the agreement, and collects monthly financing payments from the buyer. When the owner financing agreement or land contract expires, the buyer obtains third-party mortgage financing and fully repays the seller loan.




Where are you located? 

Our business address is 5951 Encina Rd. Suite 208 Goleta, CA 93117.



How do I contact Customer Support? 

Our Customer Support Department is available to assist you Monday-Friday, 6AM-6PM PST and Saturday-Sunday, 9AM-5PM PST. We can be reached by email or by phone. Our toll-free phone number is (888)�250-5563.

Transcript:
Money may not grow on trees, but the U.S. Army allows you to cultivate your own enlistment bonus with the $40,000 bonus program. 
The Army’s 40k enlistment bonus is not a flat amount. It’s a combination of five separate bonuses totaling up to $40,000, depending on the enlistment options you select to qualify for.
Customize your own incentive package by choosing enlistment options that pay the most, like a six-year enlistment for the maximum 40k bonus. 
The quick ship bonus is based on how early you can begin your Army career. The sooner you start, the higher your bonus. 
The advanced Civilian Acquired Skilled program reimburses you for civilian acquired training, like a commercial driver’s license or CDL. 
Critical Military Occupational Specialty Bonuses are available for select jobs critical to the Army’s success, like cyber warrior. 
Language Skills bonuses may be available for those already proficient in an Army-critical language.
The special Skills bonus pays out for special training you enlist for like airborne school or Ranger school. 
To see if you qualify for this opportunity, reach out to your local recruiter and start building your own enlistment bonus package.



















BONUSES: EARNING EXTRA MONEY
YOU HAVE TO EARN A PLACE ON OUR TEAM
You must earn your place on the Army team and in addition to Basic Pay and Drill Pay, Soldiers have many opportunities to earn additional money.

Soldier & Family Services




	       Benefits
	
















SOLDIER & FAMILY SERVICES
TAKING CARE OF FAMILIES
Beyond salary, education and housing benefits, there are valuable Army family support services for Soldiers and their families. These include, but are not limited to, support groups, counseling and training. Many of the services are offered free or at discounted prices.









    	            
    	                RELOCATION ASSISTANCE SERVICES
The Army offers several unique programs to help Soldiers adapt to transfers and new tour cycles. Through briefings and a Web-based resource called the Standard Information Topics Exchange, Soldiers may access photos, maps, base housing floor plans and information on services and programs offered at the installation.

 
 






    	            
    	                MONEY MANAGEMENT SERVICES
Financial readiness programs are available to educate and counsel Soldiers in the area of personal finance. Through classes on money management, financial planning and insurance and consumer counseling, Soldiers learn how to eliminate debt and manage their money wisely.

 
 







    	            
    	                FAMILY ADVOCACY SERVICES
A wide range of family advocacy initiatives are available to Army families, from new parent support groups to abuse prevention classes to assistance for families with special needs.
 
 







    	            
    	                LEGAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES
Every Army post has a Legal Assistance Center that provides free walk-in services. The attorneys on staff offer advice on personal legal matters; review legal documents such as contracts and leases; and prepare wills, correspondence and other legal documents. Legal Assistance Centers also operate tax centers, with free income tax preparation and electronic filing for active duty Soldiers, dependents and military retirees.

 
 







    	            
    	                DEPLOYMENT SERVICES
Predeployment and reunion briefings are provided through the Mobilization and Deployment Support program. The program offers classes for Soldiers and their families on topics such as how to establish and manage household budgets, how to communicate with children and how to prepare wills. Family members are encouraged to join Family Readiness Groups and maintain communication with the rear detachment of the deployed unit.

 
 







    	            
    	                CHILD & YOUTH SERVICES
Army Child and Youth Services provide affordable child-care programs for Army families. Costs are typically based on rank and pay grade. Programs range from day-care facilities to sports and fitness programs.

Child development centers provide full-day care, part-day care and hourly care for children 6 weeks to 5 years of age.
Family child-care homes offer full day, hourly, extended hours and long-term care in government quarters and off-post residences.
School-age services deliver before- and after-school care during the school year and camps during vacations.
Middle school/teen programs focus on sports and fitness, life skills and leadership, arts and recreation and mentoring and education for youth grades six through 12.
Sports and fitness programs are available for children up to 18 years of age and include team sports, individual sports, fitness and outreach.
Youth education support services include school transition support, instructional programs, youth sponsorship and home-school support.
Outreach programs include referrals to off-post child-care programs, parent co-ops, trained babysitters for evening hourly care and partnerships with community organizations.


 
 







    	            
    	                ARMY MORALE, WELFARE AND RECREATION PROGRAM
The U.S. Army also offers a network of support and leisure services for Soldiers and their families. The Army Morale, Welfare and Recreation program delivers a wide array of recreation, sports, entertainment, travel and leisure activities for Soldiers and their families worldwide.
Want to experience life on an actual Army base? Take the goarmy.com virtual tour, which will give you a first-person view of the locations you will visit every day as a Soldier on post.

American Homes 4 Rent is a real estate investment trust based in Agoura Hills, California. It was established in 2012 by Public Storage founder B. Wayne Hughes[1] Early funding included $600 million from the Alaska Permanent Fund.[1] The company held its initial public offering in August 2013.[2] As of 2015, it owned over 34,000 single-family homes in the United States.[3] It was one of the first large public companies to begin investing heavily in single-family homes, following the entry of The Blackstone Group into the field in 2012.[4]
