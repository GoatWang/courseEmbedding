10 Symptoms of Klinefelter Syndrome
AilmentsBody
Published on Tuesday, April 4th, 2017 @ 8:21 pm



Health Team

Klinefelter is a rather odd and somewhat disgusting derangement of male body development. It is not a disease since men are born with, and there’s no way to contract it. If you know a thing or two about biology, you’re probably aware of the fact that we are all female at the beginning of conception, since we start off with XX chromosomes. Over time, one X can turn into a Y, which causes the change of sex necessary for the fetus to develop as a male. Klinefelter occurs when another X is added, meaning the carrier has XXY (or XYX) chromosomes.
The death toll of Klinefelter is 0, so there’s nothing to worry about there. However, it is socially crippling and may cause the afflicted to suffer from depression and other mental illnesses in their isolation. One would also expect men with an extra female chromosome to be homosexual, but they are mostly just straight men with healthy lives until one day they realize Klinefelter’s presence and eventually try to cope with its scariest symptom. This syndrome is untreatable, of course, and there are almost no ways of knowing whether your newborn has it or not, but based on 10 of the following symptoms, you can quickly conclude its presence.
1. Gynaecomastia
From the Greek word ‘Gynaeca’ (gynaika) – which means woman, this condition causes the most unflattering appearance in the afflicted males. Don’t be fooled, though, gynecomastia appears in heavy eaters and drinkers, for the most part, thanks to various fast food ingredients and the phytoestrogen found in most beer variations. Although it can be caused by other factors – such as intake, the appearance of breast tissue in men is often predisposed by this syndrome, meaning it has to be surgically removed to completely subside.
