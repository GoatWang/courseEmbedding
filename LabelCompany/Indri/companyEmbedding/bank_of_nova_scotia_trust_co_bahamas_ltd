With so many fiduciary options available and different facets to be taken into consideration, working with a Scotia Wealth Management relationship manager with access to international and local expertise can be an effective way to address your unique needs. We specialize in complex structures which may include multi-faceted touch points and financial and non-financial assets, providing you with a financial plan that takes your world-wide assets into consideration.
Using tailored asset holding vehicles and associated services, you, your relationship manager and a team of relevant wealth management specialists work in partnership with your external advisors to design and implement your preferred structure. Your Scotiatrust specialist also consults with you about integrating governance oversight that is designed to take into account decision making, family values, dispute resolution as well as the allocation and management of assets.
Once the appropriate structure(s) has been determined, a dedicated team will provide you with ongoing support and service.

By appointing Scotiatrust as Executor and/or Trustee of your estate, you are helping to ensure that the desires expressed in your Will and trusts are carried out with sensitivity, professionalism and objectivity. Experienced professionals at Scotiatrust administer and manage estates and trusts of varying complexity and value in a timely manner and are sensitive to the needs and concerns of family members and other beneficiaries.

What is a SWIFT code?

SWIFT codes are used to identify banks and financial institutions worldwide. They are used by the swift network to transmit wire transfers (money transactions) and messages between them. For international wire transfers, swift codes are always required in order to make transactions secure and fast.










These codes were initially introduced by the SWIFT organization as “swift codes” but were later standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as “BIC” meaning “Business Identifier Codes”. Most people think B.I.C. stands for “Bank Identifier Codes” (“bank” instead of “business”) but that is incorrect since non-financial institutions can also join the swift network.


A “BIC code” can be seen by many different names, like “SWIFT code” (most common), “SWIFT ID”, “SWIFT-BIC”, “SWIFT address”, “BEI” (that comes from “Business Entity Identifier”), or even “ISO 9362”, which is the standard format that has been approved by the ISO organization. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.


In depth analysis of a swift code

Swift codes are broken down into sections, in the same way telephone numbers are broken into sections, and every section reveals some information about the institution that was assigned this code. They consist of eight or eleven characters. Whenever an eight-character code is used, then it is referring to the headquarters (main office) of the institution.Here is how an 11-character code is broken down and what each section of characters represents. Let's take this imaginary 11-character swift code: 

AAAABBCCDDD


It can be broken down to these sections:

AAAA – BB – CC - DDD


Section 1 (the first 4-characters “AAAA”): This code is used to identify the institution’s global presence (all branches and all divisions around the world). For example, “CHAS” is used for “JPMORGAN CHASE BANK”











Section 2 (5th and 6th characters “BB”): This two-letter code represents the country of this particular institution’s branch and follows the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard for representing country codes. For example, “US” for “UNITED STATES”, “GB” for “UNITED KINGDOM”, CA for “CANADA”, etc.


Section 3 (7th and 8th characters “CC”): These characters represent a location code (e.g. “FF” is the code for “Frankfurt”, “KK” is the code for Copenhagen, etc.) and also the second character (8th in the B.I.C.) sometimes carries this information:



If it is equal to “0”, then it typically is a BIC assigned for testing purposes (as opposed to a BIC used on the live network).
If it is equal to “1”, then it denotes a passive participant in the SWIFT network.
If it is equal to "2", then it typically denotes a “reverse billing” BIC, meaning that the recipient of the message has to pay for the message.


Section 4 (9th to 11th characters “DDD”): These final three characters form a “branch code” that refers to the particular branch of the institution. If this section is omitted, then we have an 8-character swift code that is assumed to refer to the HEAD OFFICE of the institution. Also, a typical naming convention is that in the case we are referring to the main offices of an institution, this branch code is “XXX”.


Some popular swift code searches:



Bank of America swift code: Bank of America BOFAUS3NXXX (or simply: BOFAUS3N)
Chase swift code: JP Morgan Chase CHASUS33XXX (or simply: CHASUS33)
HSBC swift code: HSBC Bank PLC MIDLGB22XXX (or simply MIDLGB22)









Try our online SWIFT/BIC lookup tool to locate any of the thousands active or passive swift codes. Our primary focus is to provide you with the most accurate and up to date database of financial institutions all over the world. You can search for an institution’s detailed data by entity name, BIC, or even specific keywords that narrow the search results even more. You can also browse for swift codes by clicking on the list of countries and then choosing the institution's name from the alphabetical list.

What is SWIFT Code?
The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) Code is the internationally recognized standard form for the Business Identifier Codes (BIC) used to identify a bank. Each bank has its unique code that distinguishes it from every other bank, a crucial step for the secure transferring of funds between banks. Swift code is used primarily for international bank wire transfers, SEPA payments and sometimes it is also used by banks for exchanging messages.
SWIFT Code Format
Each SWIFT Code is a series of 4 codes. The first is the 4 letter bank code which is typically an abbreviated version of the bank’s name. Next is the 2 letter country code followed by a 2 digit location code which indicates where the bank’s headquarters are. The location code can be two letters or two numbers, but the first two parts of the code are only made up of letters. The final part of the SWIFT Code is an optional 3 digit number that indicates the particular branch of the bank. This last part can be a combination of letters and numbers as well.
 The length of the swift code is either of 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters depending on type of financial institution.
International Bank Wire Instructions
 For international bank wire one needs to provide following details:

Recipient Name
Recipient Bank Name and Address
Account Number of the Recipient
SWIFT Code
IBAN Code (Depends on country to country)

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.
