The members of the Gillespie County Sheriff’s Office, are committed to excellence in law enforcement and are dedicated to the people, traditions and diversity of Gillespie County. In order to protect life and property, prevent crime and reduce the fear of crime, they will provide service with understanding, response with compassion, performance with integrity and law enforcement with vision.

The jail includes separate areas for male and female inmates, special confinement and padded cells, a “drunk tank,” as well as eight- and 12-person group jail cells equipped with bunk beds, seating and an in-cell, automated shower system.  The facility can host up to 26 female inmates at one time, considerably larger than the two female inmates that could be housed at the current jail.  An expanded sallyport area leading directly into the jail’s booking area can house up to four police vehicles at one time, Mills said.  Prisoners can be placed in holding cells while being processed by the arresting officer, helping police get out of the jail facility and back out on the streets sooner, the sheriff said.
Where do I go to ask about someone who has been arrested?
