Estabrook to Chief Operating OfficerNew role created to support FILA’s sustained revenue and profit momentumConsolidated operations to serve a new generation of FILA partners, customers and fans                                                                                                                                FILA North America, the U.S.- based arm of the iconic Italian sportswear brand founded in 1911, announced the elevation of Jennifer O.

She has earned the trust and respect of her FILA colleagues both in the U.S. and across the world, and I know she will successfully lead our efforts to elevate and better coordinate our North American operations in addition to her existing global role.”After recording a $55 million loss in 2007, the year it was acquired by FILA Korea, FILA USA returned to profitability in 2010, and most recently grew revenue 36 percent in 2013 and 29 percent in 2014. The company recently completed the integration of the FILA businesses in Mexico and Canada to form FILA North America.Ms. Estabrook oversaw key aspects of these developments in her dual role as FILA North America’s Executive Vice President, Business Operations and the head of FILA’s global licensing business. Her new role will include integrating North American operations, leveraging shared assets to increase sales, marketing and sourcing efficiencies, and driving initiatives to strengthen the company’s global supply chain and U.S. fulfillment operations.“Jon’s tremendous commercial abilities and passion for our brand as well as our partner relationships have created a wealth of new opportunities for FILA North America,” said Ms. Estabrook. “In order to leverage these opportunities and maximize the commercial pay-off, we have to be extremely buttoned-up in our supply chain, maintain the creativity and focus of our product-driven marketing collaborations, and hold all of our vendors to a high standard of excellence.”She continued: “At the same time, we have to prepare our operations to support our retailer partners in their efforts to provide their customers with an expanded range of FILA product, regardless of how they choose to access the brand.”Ms. Estabrook is a member of the board of directors of the Acushnet Company, owner of the Titleist and FootJoy golf brands, and serves as the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee. She also serves as a Trustee of the FILA Foundation, which operates the FILA Museum in Biella, Italy.
