FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period Under the Premerger Notification Rules
Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans. Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the Federal Register.
The following transactions were granted early termination—on the dates indicated—of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger notification rules. The listing for each transaction includes the transaction number and the parties to the transaction. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.

Offshore Companies > Corporations vs. LLCs


Corporations vs. LLCs
Offshore company incorporation, or forming a company in a different country than you reside, is the same process as filing domestic legal entities. The articles of incorporation are drafted according to legal statute. The documents are filed with the jurisdiction government office by a licensed company, as required by law, such as OffshoreCompany.com and associates. Then, initial offshore company formation documents and registration certificates, as well as a declaration location of a registered agent within the incorporating jurisdiction, are filed with the appropriate agencies. The exact requirements of forming offshore companies varies from each jurisdiction. Regardless of your jurisdiction, OffshoreCompany.com will complete all of your paperwork, file your documents, set up your registered agent and facilitate the entire offshore incorporation process for you.
Incorporating Offshore
Incorporating offshore requires that costs and fees be paid to the incorporating jurisdiction and various agents of representation. Here is a list of items that are included in most of our offshore company incorporation packages:

Offshore companies incorporation fee
Post incorporation structure fee
Initial license fee
Disbursements

Annual compliance fee
Annual license fee

We form thousands of offshore companies for a  worldwide consumer base and have become the larges incorporation service in the US. We are rated number one in customer service. Call a representative today to find out how quickly and easily we can help with your offshore service needs.
